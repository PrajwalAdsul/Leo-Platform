0,2,"How Pilot crashed
The sordid bid to topple the Rajasthan government has exposed the worst in both the Congress party and the BJP.
 
Going by the confessions, the inspired leaks and the whispers, it is clear that chief minister Ashok Gehlot has not been on talking terms with his deputy, Sachin Pilot, since December 2018.
But Gehlot apparently had a line of communication with the former maharani of Dholpur and princess of Gwalior, Vasundhara Raje Scindia.
Sources in both the BJP and the Congress reveal that Gehlot was a step ahead of Pilot simply because someone from Vasundhara Raje's side was tipping him off about Pilot’s moves. Gehlot, a former magician, kept gathering information and piling up a dossier that read like a charge-sheet. The crafty Gehlot did not rush to Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi or Rahul Gandhi with this dossier.
 
A chartered plane was reportedly sent to Thiruvananthapuram to fetch AICC general secretary K.C. Venugopal, a favourite of Rahul; he, in turn, handed over the explosive material to the Gandhis.
The Gandhis are now in a dilemma. Their stated position of opposing anyone having truck with the BJP is compromised as both Gehlot and Pilot were reportedly in touch with the enemy.
Corona protocol
Covid-19 has changed a lot in Lutyens’ Delhi. In the Raksha Rajya Mantri’s office for instance, defence ministry personnel are not encouraged to visit unless they are summoned.
 
The informal list of do’s and don’ts at Dr Subhash Bhamre’s office also demands that officers remain seated each time the minister walks in or out.
Baluni fortunate
Union urban development and civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri made a smart move by allocating Priyanka Gandhi’s bungalow — 35, Lodhi Estate, New Delhi — to Amit Shah’s right-hand man Anil Baluni, who also heads the BJP’s media department.
Baluni is recovering from cancer so the sympathy factor also came into play. Puri’s statement that Priyanka tried seeking an extension was quickly denied by the AICC general secretary but it may have a grain of truth.
 
Apparently, without Priyanka’s knowledge or consent, Anand Sharma or K.T.S. Tulsi are suspected to have spoken to Puri even while Priyanka was all set to move out of Lodhi Estate.
Who broke quarantine
Covid-19 continues to bother the political class. At a recently held meeting of Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee, a senior official sat close to Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary, the Congress party leader in the Lok Sabha.
The additional secretary rank babu tested positive for the coronavirus. Everyone, including Chaudhary, had to while away time in home quarantine — other than a BJP notable who is said to have ignored the advice.
 
Sun shines for PR
While the Ashok Gehlot-Sachin Pilot tussle has stressed out a section of the Congress party, some public relations companies are gloating. A prominent Delhi-based PR person, known to have near-perfect relations with many politicians, quickly grabbed Gehlot’s account.
Every morning, scribes and talking heads on TV covering the Rajasthan slugfest have been getting a healthy dose of talking points on WhatsApp. Pilot’s side is not sitting idle. Last heard, Pilot, an accomplished pistol shooter, has engaged some fine PR personalities. They are not missing the target either.

1,6,"For some high-fliers the party hasn’t stopped despite the coronavirus pandemic. A Hyderabad jeweller who threw a lavish birthday bash attended by at least 100 people died of COVID-19 on Saturday. This is not the first such event, since India began unlocking.
In Bihar, a wedding ceremony in rural Patna on June 15 set off the biggest coronavirus infection chain so far, and the groom was among those who died while around a 100 were infected.
In May, a Hyderabad shop owner threw a party after which 45 tested positive in May.
 
In Tamil Nadu, a DMK man who organised a bash for his birthday in Thiruvallur district on June 14 has tested positive for Coronavirus along with three guests.
It may be recalled, singer Kanika Kapoor’s Lucknow party in March exposed several to the coronavirus.
Why are people finding it so difficult to act in accordance with containment demands? Don’t they realise how their actions can affect others?
These are classic examples of the misplaced belief that ‘Nothing will happen to me’. Sanjay Gulabani, chairman, P. Mangatram Jewellers, says,
 
“Each one of us needs to act responsibly. For the economy to not get further beaten out of shape, the lockdown was relaxed. The purpose of the lockdown was to create awareness and get people ready to adapt to the new codes. It is up to us to be judicious in protecting our health,” he pointed out.
“There was general carelessness and apathy towards the problem,” feels Uday Pilani, entrepreneur and investor, who owns hotels in the UK, as well as the FinTech and Management Consulting company in India.
“The Agarwal Marwadi Samaj now has over a thousand affected. The thing is that the recovery rate is excellent, so they are losing fear,” he adds.
 
It’s been difficult to curb the jet-setting crowd from organising parties and society events. “Now is not the time to show your status; it’s time to show responsibility. The vast majority of the people who are defying calls for social distancing are not realising that it’s not about just them... it’s about taking a risk with their families and friends as well. It’s time we all get responsible and accept that precaution is better than cure,” says Madhu Jain, an entrepreneur.
While the world’s scientists are working towards finding a cure and vaccines for COVID-19, we need to take all preventive measures, feels Bina Mehta, another entrepreneur.
 
“Social distancing will only ‘flatten the curve’. Let us all understand and respect our own lives and value others’ lives too. It is a sin to invite people to events, and an even bigger sin to be part of any event,” says Bina.
Life doesn’t have to stop because of the Coronavirus, but it’s smart to re-evaluate priorities, feels entrepreneur Vinod Ranka,. “I was invited to few parties and weddings, but I declined the invitations,” he says, giving an example of how priorities should change.

2,8,"With retailers and clothing units shutting shop, and millions of workers scrambling to make ends meet, nobody frankly knows the future of fashion. Experts say need-based sustainable fashion will rule.
Neil Pate
 
The coronavirus crisis has crumpled the social fabric of our lives and the fashion industry like. Be it the way we address our financial goals or the way we dress.
Even as fashion titans like Louis Vuitton, Prada, Gucci and some Indian designers are casting their bread upon the waters to create safe and sustainable clothing (including PPE), the most that we can do is wait. And watch!
Fashion historians point out that people changed their dressing style after the 1918 Flu Pandemic, the Great Depression and World War II. The 2020 Covid-19 pandemic is no exception.
 
With retailers and clothing units shutting shop, and millions of workers scrambling to make ends meet, nobody frankly knows the future of fashion or the new ‘quarantrends’.
A la Mode
Some designers say dressier days are on the horizon as people would want to spread cheer and positive vibes. Some opine dull and somber attire goes with the current mood. Yet, a few others are optimistic of the easy-on-the-eye-and-pocket florals.
The online market of second-hand and recycled clothes, shoes and accessories has already seen a spike. You may nod and naff in equal measure, but it looks like Back to Basics!
 
Ritu Kumar, the doyenne of Indian fashion industry, who began her career in 1969 with just four hand block printers and two tables in a small village near Calcutta (now Kolkata), says that there were recessionary trends in the fashion industry even before the pandemic.
“Business had slowed down after demonetisation. Now, there will be a trend of need-based buying. I won’t be surprised if we are pushed back by another 20 years,” says Kumar, whose understanding of ancient Indian designs, traditional crafts and Indian fashion market is unmatched.
 
She adds that you cannot compare the Indian fashion industry to the international ones. “The fashion industry in the western world has been there for over 100-150 years. The Indian fashion industry has been around for only 30-40 years.”
However, Kumar feels the saree, kurta and kurtis will make a comeback to beat the corona blues. “A saree suits all occasions. It is low on maintenance too. Men usually spend on branded shirts and trousers. But now people will move towards ethnic wear. The kurta will be the much-favoured choice for men and women,” she says.
 
Beleaguered Workforce
India has an estimated 16 million crafts-people working in the textile industry.  A majority of them in rural areas and are involved in the most intricate work like weaving, embroidery and creation of embellishments etc.
These craftsmen have mastered their craft over centuries and passed it on from one generation to the other. The pandemic has brought about an “unprecedented” crisis.
Today, thousands of craftsmen are without work. Customers are still hesitant to enter malls and shops to buy clothes although there has been a spike in online shopping.
 
Jugnu Gosrani, a Mumbai-based designer, who creates free-spirited clothes, says all her sales are online.
“We are all saddled with unsold merchandise. This month, I managed to sell kurtis, dresses and skirts online in my housing society itself. Customers order online. I leave the outfit outside their door in a sealed plastic bag,” explains Jugnu. She is certain that people will stick to affordable and sustainable clothes.
The only ‘In thing’ right now are protective masks. Jeans, joggers and leggings are also in demand. Whether you step out to run errands or go for a jog. The mask is here to stay for a long time. “I’m making kalamkari masks from the leftover fabrics,” Jugnu adds.
 
No Big Spenders  
Designer Rina Dhaka feels it is impossible to quantify the losses since it is interlinked from retail giants to exporters to the migrant workers. “Work is a struggle and one is trying to get up again,” she says.
After the pandemic, Rina plans to move back to crafts, wovens and sustainable models of fashion. “I will also simplify the couture. Maybe more as singles or separates to make the spending easier,” she says.  
Grapevine from the fashion circuit tells us that nearly four designers and their loved ones have had a close brush with the virus. Earlier, designers had to run the gauntlet of TV cameras and fashion photographers.
 
Now, it will take plenty of pluck to re-fashion one’s business model and pull through the mess. The Fashion Design Council of India has already announced a Covid-19 Support Fund for small businesses and young designers in need.
Ritu Kumar is certain that fast fashion will be out. “In India, people purchase clothes for functions and festivals (Diwali, Eid, Christmas, Baisakhi) unlike the west where the fashion ramp is dictated by changing seasons and colours.” Kumar is optimistic that people will bounce back. “We will have to focus on ‘Make in India’ to pull through this crisis,” she says.  
 
Make Every Outfit Count
Today, millions of people are either out of work or have taken pay cuts. The recession has forced people to set their priorities and rethink their spending.  Nishit Gupta, director of KALKI says people are tired of this panic mode.
“Fashion trends will vary as the world slowly emerges from the global quarantine. With weddings now becoming more intimate, smaller in size, the fusion trends will find favour with both brides and bridesmaids. Mirror lehengas, organza skirts, pre-stitched sarees, necklet gowns, dhoti-crop tops in handwoven fabrics and hand-done embroideries with traditional textile techniques will trend. It will also help support the rural artisans and handloom communities,” says Nishit.
 
The pandemic shockwaves have hit every industry. The ‘new normal’ will make us slow down, and reinvent how we view consumption and production.
“If you view forecasts, by next year from a slated -4% drop this year in the GDP, we may be able to achieve a growth of 4% in 2021, provided we take control of the production and job creation by being self sufficient,” says Bahaar Dhawan Rohatgi, a Delhi-based lawyer-cum-visual artist and influencer.
She hopes the fashion sector will become more responsible and sustainable.
 
“I hope aficionados will promote products that employ environmental-friendly, fair practices, minimise waste and boast functionality. We may witness a tipping point where designers will be drawn to celebrate austerity, emphasising a classless society (remember post war ‘Austerity Britain drive’ in the 1940s) signifying affordability, access to leisure, health, value life and maintaining balance,” says Bahaar. Perhaps need-based sustainable dressing is the glamour we’ve been missing!

3,11,"Paris: Tech giants love to portray themselves as forces for good and as the United States was gripped by anti-racism protests a number of them publicly disavowed selling controversial facial recognition technology to police forces.
Facial recognition has numerous applications that could simplify our lives as we’ve seen with Apple using it to unlock smartphones or in stores to replace cash registers.
 
But the technology has a dark side, with facial recognition integrated into China’s massive public surveillance system and its social credit experiment where even minor infractions of public norms can result in sanctions.
As the protests spread across the United States about police violence and racism, pressure mounted on tech firms about the technology. Microsoft and Amazon announced they would suspend sales of facial recognition software to police forces while IBM said it would exit the business.
Privacy and rights groups worry about the implications of the use of facial recognition technology by law enforcement.
 
‘Extremely intrusive’ technology        
“It is an extremely intrusive form of surveillance and can seriously undermine our freedoms and eventually our society as a whole,” says Privacy International.
“The biggest danger is that this technology will be used for general, suspicionless surveillance systems,” says for its part the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).
It notes that US state governments hold extensive photo databases as part of their motor vehicle departments, which if combined with public surveillance or other cameras, could result in “a comprehensive system of identification and tracking”.
 
In January 2020, a New York Times investigation pulled back the curtain on the activities of Californian startup Clearview AI, whose facial recognition tool “could end your ability to walk down the street anonymously”.
Social network photos scraped          
That is because Clearview AI doesn’t use photos held by governments, but billions of photos scraped from social media sites.
While social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube (Google) and LinkedIn (Microsoft) protested against the unsanctioned use of their users’ photos, Clearview hasn’t acceded to their demands to delete them.
 
The firm, which received funding from PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, says it has already signed up 600 law enforcement agencies worldwide.
According to advocacy group AlgorithmWatch, at least 10 European police forces already use facial recognition technology and haven’t needed to turn to the tech giants.
“I have never seen a contract between Microsoft, Amazon or IBM and a police force in the investigations I have done on the subject,” said journalist Nicolas Kayser-Bril, who did the research behind the AlgorithmWatch report.
 
Technology already widely available              
“Tools for conducting facial recognition are widely available,” he added, noting that BriefCam, a subsidiary of Japanese multinational Canon which specialises in ultra-rapid analysis of images, is one of the leaders in the European market.
China has begun to export its facial recognition technology, particularly via its telecoms equipment giant Huawei.
A company executive told a business forum in Morocco last year that with its technology not only the identity of a person can be identified, but educational and work experience, personal preferences and recent travel.
 
In February, The Intercept cited a report that 10 European police forces are considering a joint network for facial recognition searches by extending agreements in place that allow sharing of biometric information like DNA and fingerprints.
France’s interior ministry is expected to unveil soon proposals to widen the use of the technology, with officials keen to be able to use in certain cases such as terrorist attacks and child kidnappings.

4,12,"New Delhi: Most mobile applications that track the spread of COVID-19 require access to users’ personal data, but only a handful indicate the data would be anonymous, encrypted and secured, according to a study by Indian-origin researchers in the US.
Professor Masooda Bashir and doctoral student Tanusree Sharma from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign analysed 50 COVID-19-related apps available in the Google Play store for their access to users’ personal data and their privacy protections.
 
The researchers noted that it is disconcerting that these apps are continuously collecting and processing highly sensitive and personally identifiable information, about health, location and direct identifiers like name, age, email address and voter or national identification of a user.
“Governments’ use of such tracking technology—and the possibilities for how they might use it after the pandemic—is chilling to many,” the researchers wrote in the study published in the journal Nature Medicine.
“Notably, surveillance mapping through apps will allow governments to identify people’s travel paths and their entire social networks,” they noted.
 
The researchers explained that functionalities of the COVID-related apps developed around the world include live maps and updates of confirmed cases, real-time location-based alerts, systems for monitoring home isolation and quarantine, direct reporting to the government of symptoms, and education about COVID-19.
Some also offer monitoring of vital signs, virtual medical consultations and community-driven contact tracing, the said.
Of the 50 apps the researchers evaluated, 30 require users’ permission to access data from their mobile devices such as contacts, photos, media, files, location data, the camera.
 
These 30 apps also require the device’s ID, call information, Wi-Fi connection, microphone, network access, the Google service configuration, and the ability to change network connectivity and audio settings, according to the study.
Some of the apps, the researchers said, state they will collect users’ age, email address, phone number and postal code; the device’s location, unique identifiers, mobile IP address and operating system; and the types of browsers used on the device.
Only 16 of the apps indicated such data will be anonymous, encrypted, secured and reported only in aggregate form, they said.
 
Of the apps sampled in the study, 20 were issued by governments, health ministries and other such official sources.
The researchers acknowledged that mass surveillance measures may be necessary to contain the spread of the virus.
“Health care providers must absolutely use whatever means are available to save lives and confine the spread of the virus,” they wrote in the journal.
However, the researchers added that it is up to the rest, especially those in the field of information privacy and security, to ask the questions needed to protect the right to privacy.

5,15,"New Delhi: Getting unwarranted video call requests at odd hours and comments on social media photos by male colleagues who are not friends are among issues of sexual harassment women working from home during the nationwide lockdown have faced, organisations working against cyber harassment said.
The coronavirus-triggered lockdown has posed a lot of challenges for women professionals especially, as they struggle to manage the work-life balance. In addition, they are also facing sexual harassment online.
 
Many women have approached experts for guidance, unsure of how to raise complaints of sexual harassment in the work-from-home scenario.
“There are no clear guidelines from companies on how work from home should function in an organisation and that confuses women. I have been receiving 4-5 such complaints of harassment everyday ever since the lockdown was imposed,” said Akancha Srivastava, who runs the foundation Akancha Against Harassment, an initiative against cyber harassment.
However, the number of complaints received by the National Commission for Women (NCW) has been low since the lockdown began but those working in the field say that could be because many women do not want to officially complain but wish to consult what they can do on the matter.
 
“During the lockdown, many women are worried about their job security so they are not sure if they should speak up or not. The women have a constant worry that they should not be seen as troublemakers,” Srivastava said.
 “Since we have never experienced absolute work from home before, women are always second-guessing if it was harassment, where does one draw the line, how does one define the body language as offensive or indecent? Male colleagues stalking them on social media or sending friend requests, commenting on their pictures when they are not even friends.
 
“Women are being told to come online at odd hours. These are subtle ways of sexually harassing them,” she said.
Giving examples, Srivastava said one woman had recently received a video call request from her boss at 11 pm for an “urgent matter”, but when she received the call it turned out to be for something that on a regular day would have been easily taken care of over an email.
Srivastava said that with work-from-home, there are bound to be some disruptions and that colleagues should respectfully accept them, but that is not happening. That is causing more stress to women.
 
For example, in a sexist comment, another woman was asked by her boss over video call if she was capable of handling work assigned to her as she seemed “distracted” because of her children who were playing in the background.
Some women have also complained that they find their colleagues inappropriately dressed during virtual meetings and it made them uncomfortable.
The Prohibition of Sexual Harassment Act 2013 (or POSH) was enacted to ensure safe working spaces for women and to build enabling work environments that respect the rights of working women to equality of status and opportunity.
 
It defined a ‘workplace’ as “any place visited by employee arising out of or during the course of employment, including transportation provided by the employer for undertaking such a journey”. As such, while working from home, the home can also be defined as the workplace.
An activist at InfoSec Girls, an organisation educating women on cyber security, said a lot of people don’t report but wish to discuss what they should do when they face sexual harassment.
The activist said there have been times when men either do not realise that women colleagues are also on the call or choose to wilfully ignore it, while passing inappropriate comments.
 
Also, now that everyone is working from home, colleagues have lost sense of propriety about when a female colleague can be contacted. People end calling anytime and begin meetings at odd times. This can make women uncomfortable as they have to balance family life with work, she said.
“When women raise these kinds of concerns, we say, ‘if you feel uncomfortable with any discussion or comment, raise the concern immediately on the call so it does not happen again. If that makes them uncomfortable, then discuss it with the leadership or raise it via the organisation reporting channel’,” she said.
 
Every organisation is supposed to follow the Visakha guidelines on sexual harassment. “There is a proper council that addresses all these concerns. Women can anonymously report the concerns. The council then discusses the concern with person against whom the complaint was raised. If nothing else works out, women can report to local authorities,” she said.

6,16,"Tipplers in the five southern states of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala are eagerly awaiting the home delivery of alcohol as Zomato and Swiggy expanded the services launched in Jharkhand last week to Odisha today.
Less than a week after putting ‘wine shops’ in Jharkhand on its platform, Zomato expanded to Bhubaneswar and will soon deliver to other cities such as Rourkela, Balasore, Balangir, Sambalpur, Berhampur and Cuttack. Swiggy said it was starting with Bhubaneswar and Rourkela and would soon serve Cuttack and Berhampur as well.
 
The southward direction that the alcohol delivery services of the apps have taken bring hope to drinkers in the five southern states. While liquor outlets have opened in most places in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, Kerala is still holding out.
The state, whose largest source of revenue is alcohol sales, has exercised restraint in opening up its state-owned Beverages Corporation (Bevco) outlets, cautious about triggering a setback to its successfully continuing fight against COVID-19, as people would inevitably crowd the wine shops.
 
To get around the problem, Kerala is launching its own Bevco app called Bev Q. Unlike Swiggy and Zomato that offer home delivery, Bev Q is a mobile virtual queue management app, which will enable the state to reopen liquor outlets while getting the public to adhere to physical distancing norms.
It has even passed the Google test, reports said, paving the way for the app to be listed for download on the Android Play Store.
Nevertheless tipplers would like the option of Swiggy and Zomato home delivery.
How a country coy about liquor allowed home delivery
 
After liquor shops across the country were shut down when the lockdown began on March 25,  as the restrictions were eased recently, the Supreme Court asked states to consider non-direct contact or online sales and home delivery of liquor during the lockdown period to prevent the spread of coronavirus on account of crowding at the shops.
Zomato and Swiggy, which already have a food delivery network in place across the country, then worked with state excise departments to work out the modalities of home delivery. To ensure compliance with safety guidelines as well as the laws on alcohol consumption, the two platforms verify the identity of the buyers to confirm they are not underage.
 
Users are required to upload a valid ID proof to order on the apps, which are later verified by delivery executives at the time of handing over the order. There would also be limits on how many bottles can be purchased, Zomato said.
Swiggy said it was partnering with authorised retailers after validating their licence and other required documents as outlined by the state government. It is also going one step further by getting customers to upload not just valid government ID but also a selfie, which the platform will use for authentication.
 
The company has partnered with HyperVerge to enable AI-face recognition for mandatory age verification and user authentication for alcohol deliveries, it said.

It has been four months to the day since India was put into lockdown to ward off the coronavirus. During the anxious days of Lockdown 1.0,the peak was promised in a few weeks, and then late May. But when the lockdown was eased in May, the only peaks in sight were the Himalayas from Saharanpur.

Where then are the peaks of COVID? In the last few weeks, talk of India soon approaching the COVID-19 peak have begun to be heard in murmurs.

First, it was Public Health Foundation of India president Dr K Srinath Reddy who said that coronavirus incidence could peak in mid-September in India but added that different states could witness different peak periods. Now, it is Prof GVS Murthy of the Indian Institute of Public Health who has reiterated Dr Reddy's message elaborately.

There cannot be a uniform peak in COVID-19 cases in a large country like India and each state has its own trajectory based on when people there were exposed to the infection, Murthy told PTI on Saturday.

Now, among the states and Union Territories, Delhi is predicted to peak by the end of July or early August. While Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra – some of the worst-affected states in India – are likely to witness the corona peak in September, which is in line with Dr Reddy's prediction.

South of Vindhyas: Come September

""States like Telangana, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu should be able to achieve the maximum number of cases by mid-September,"" Murthy said, adding that these states are currently reporting high numbers but won't do so after mid-September.

Tamil Nadu may peak a bit quicker because it boiled up faster. The state with over 2 lakh confirmed cases of COVID-19 can witness its corona peak by the middle or the third week of August. However, the influx of guest workers made it worse for the southern state. Health minister C Vijaybaskar had blamed guest workers, especially those coming from Maharashtra, for the spurt in cases.

Maharashtra has also been held up as one of the contributors to the spurt in Karnataka. The latter state has nearly 91,000 cases but what is more worrying is the slipping recovery rate of patients. Karnataka now has a recovery rate of around 37 per cent, which is much lower than the national average of 63.54 per cent. Moreover, Karnataka's state of affairs is worth noting because just few weeks back, it was being hailed as a success story in contact tracing.

Already under the scanner for alleged under-reporting of cases and fatalities, Telangana has become one of the corona hubs since June. Since June 3, when the state crossed 3,000 cases, the total number of cases has risen by 1,637 per cent. In addition, the state has one of the lowest testing rates, with just 3,37,771 people tested so far.

With testing likely togo up after multiple criticisms of the state administration's handling of the pandemic, there are also chances of cases piling up. So, Telangana witnessing a September looks like a possibility.

Kerala, however, deserves special mention. ""Kerala,you have seen now. They thought they had seen the end of COVID. Suddenly, in the last over 10 days, Kerala has had a much larger number of cases than before,"" Murthy told PTI.

Kerala was being hailed as a model state even by the WHO, which said, “The state government’s prompt response to COVID-19 can be attributed to its experience and investment made in emergency preparedness and outbreak response in the past”. However, the relaxation of the lockdown and the return of Non-Resident Keralites contributed to the rise in cases.

That Kerala has recorded over 1,000 cases thrice in the last four days, is a reminder that the virus is not going away anytime soon.

Guest workers delay peak in states

However, states like Jharkhand, Murthy said, may peak at a later time as the virus began to spread only after the return of guest workers from COVID-19 hubs like Mumbai and Delhi.

""In states like Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and parts of Eastern Uttar Pradesh, the peak will take much longer. The peak would be somewhere towards the end of September or October for those states which had low reporting earlier,"" he said.

Murthy's assessment specially holds true in the case of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh – two of India's biggest migration pools.

As noted in an earlier article, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh had very low rates of infection in comparison to their populations until April 30. That date holds a major significance in India's lockdown story because the Central government began running special trains to ferry guest workers from the next day. Consequently, the numbers of COVID-19 cases began to rise in these two states.

In terms of numbers, Bihar just had 425 confirmed cases of coronavirus on April 30. It now has 36,314 cases of coronavirus. Percentage-wise, this translates to a whopping 8,444 per cent rise in cases. Moreover, Bihar continues to lag behind in testing its population, with just 4.42 lakh tested so far.

Uttar Pradesh does not fare any better. The state has 63,742 confirmed cases of COVID-19. This figure was just 2,211 on April 30. So, there has been a 2,780 per cent rise in the total cases of coronavirus. Notably,eastern UP, economically backward and sending more migrants to West and South India, became the new cause for concern after the influx of guest workers. Varanasi, in eastern UP, is the third-biggest corona hub in UP after the Lucknow-Kanpur urban agglomeration.

Chhattisgarh is an interesting case. The state just had 40 cases on April 30 but now has nearly 7,000 cases – a massive spurt of over 17,000 per cent in less than three months. Interestingly, the state was being hailed for its effective lockdown before returning guest workers undid the gains.

Delhi to see an early peak

On Saturday, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal declared victory against the COVID-19 pandemic but said the battle is far from over. He said in the last one month, the number of coronavirus cases in Delhi has gone down,deaths have reduced, recovery rate has improved and positivity ratio has lowered.

There is truth to Kejriwal's statement. The number of coronavirus cases in June rose by 319 per cent but only by 48.27 per cent in the 25 days of July. Most likely, the growth rate will still be in two digits by the end of July, when Murthy predicts the city-state's corona cases will peak. The recovery rate, too, has improved from 66.79 per cent on June 30 to 87.29 per cent on July 25.

Thus, one may even infer that Delhi, aided by superior medical infrastructure and testing facilities, may already be in the peak stage and the coming few weeks could see a further reduction in the total number of cases.

But implicitly, Murthy may have also reinforced the notion that urban areas equipped with better infrastructure can ward off epidemics better than underdeveloped regions.

8,21,"The Congress Party decided to make the Rajasthan crisis a fight to the finish and said on Saturday that it would hold protests in front of the Rashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and all Raj Bhawans across the country from Monday and launch an online campaign to protest against the BJP’s “conspiracy” to topple its government in the state.

Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot said that the party might also approach President Ram Nath Kovind.

“We will sit on a dharna outside the Rashtrapati Bhavan,” Mr Gehlot said after a meeting of the state Cabinet, which had met to re-draft a proposal to governor Kalraj Mishra to call an emergency session of the state Assembly.

Mr Gehlot also indicated that the MLAs in his camp, currently at Jaipur’s Hotel Fairmont, might have to stay there for at least 21 days more.

In Delhi, a senior Congress leader told this newspaper that MPs, MLAs and all other office bearers have been told to launch an online campaign against the BJP from Sunday.

Congress workers staged demonstrations across Rajasthan, specially in Jaipur and other district headquarters, on Saturday after the Rajasthan governor refused to call an emergency Assembly session to let Mr Gehlot prove his majority on the floor of the House.

Party workers demanded that the governor convene a session of the Assembly. In Jaipur, a demonstration was held at the Youth Congress office.

“The BJP is conspiring to topple our government and the public is watching this. Efforts are also being made by invisible powers sitting in Delhi to influence the governor. People want the elected government to complete its tenure,” state Congress president Govind Singh Dotasara said, giving a call for holding the agitation.

The BJP on its part demanded the resignation of Mr Gehlot for protesting at the Raj Bhawan on Friday.

BJP leader Gulab Chand Kataria said: “We have demanded President’s Rule in the state. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot should resign for the kind of language he used Friday.”

Meanwhile, the Cabinet meeting discussed six points raised by governor Kalraj Mishra for calling an Assembly session, sources said. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said the governor has given a note to Mr Gehlot seeking clarifications. “The governor informed that he will abide by the Constitution and will take a decision without being under any pressure,” Mr Surjewala said.",https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/politics/260720/rajasthan-political-crisis-floor-test-or-we-will-protest-says-gehlot.html,Riot,/Said:Jaipur,Said,Jaipur,2020-07-26 11:35:00+05:30,"Rajasthan political crisis: Floor test or we will protest, says Gehlot"
9,26,"New Delhi: Diesel price in the national capital on Sunday inched towards the Rs 82 per litre-mark following the second consecutive day of price hike.

Diesel price was increased by 15 paise per litre, according to a price notification of state-owned oil marketing companies.

This took the retail selling price in the national capital to the highest ever rate of Rs 81.94 per litre.

Rates vary from state to state depending on the incidence of local sales tax or VAT.

This is the second consecutive day of price increase. Rates were hiked by 15 paise on Saturday. The price increase on Saturday came after a four-day hiatus in rate revision.

Petrol prices on Sunday remained unchanged. Prices of petrol have remained static at Rs 80.43 per litre for almost four weeks. Petrol rates were last changed on June 29.

Prior to hitting the freeze button, petrol price had been increased on 21 occasions since the oil companies reverted to daily price revision on June 7.

The cumulative increase in petrol came to Rs 9.17 per litre.

Diesel rates have continued to be revised sporadically in July. The cumulative increase in diesel price since June 7 now totals Rs 12.55 per litre.

In Mumbai, petrol is priced at Rs 87.19 -- unchanged since June 29, while diesel now costs Rs 80.11 a litre.

Prior to June 7, oil companies had for 82 days not revised petrol and diesel prices as they adjusted a record increase in excise duty by the government against the fall in rates warranted due to international oil prices slumping to a two-year low.

Commenting on oil prices, ICICI Securities said sharp recovery in oil price from lows in April was driven by fall in global supply surplus from 22.7 million barrels per day (bpd) to demand-supply balance in June.

""Global oil supply in June fell by 13.7 million bpd from April levels, while demand recovered by 9.1 million bpd during the same period as per IEA. Falling supply and recovery in demand led to demand-supply balance in June vs supply surplus of 22.7 million bpd in April,"" it said.

It said lockdowns due to the second wave of infections have hurt demand recovery in the US and India.

As per EIA data, total US, gasoline and diesel demand decline was steeper in the week ended July 17 than in the preceding 4-6 weeks.

Warangal Urban district is fast emerging as one more hotspot for Covid-19 with 131 new cases, while Ranga Reddy district, that envelops Hyderabad city, recorded 171 fresh Coronavirus infections.

The past fortnight has witnessed urbanized areas in the districts other than Hyderbad as well as rural Telangana, contributing more and more to the ever increasing Covid-19 cases in the state.

Of the total 17,081 beds the government says it has for accommodating Covid-19 patients across the state, those available for occupancy, as on Saturday 8 p.m., fell to 14, 947 from 15,216 on Friday evening indicating that more of the Covid-19 patients may now be requiring hospitalization.

In yet another indication of possible severity of Coronavirus infections among the fresh cases being reported over the past few days, the health department, in its bulletin on Sunday said 1,190 beds with oxygen supply, and 317 ICU beds were occupied by patients as on Saturday evening. In comparison, on Friday, the number of people needing supplementary oxygen was 620 while the number of patients in ICUs was 235.

Interestingly, the bulletin which till Friday reported that the state had 471 ventilators in the government Covid-19 hospitals, on Sunday reported a dramatic increase in the ventilator numbers saying 1,117 were now available at these hospitals.

According to a report published by the UK tech firm Comparitech, Hyderabad ranks 16th in the list and is the top-ranked Indian metropolis. With nearly 3 lakh CCTVs for a population of over one crore (2020 estimates), Hyderabad has 30 CCTVs per 1,000 people.

Telangana director-general of police Mahender Reddy, a former Hyderabad police chief, tweeted his congratulations to the city police and other stakeholders for “making the city a safer place to live in”.

China dominates list

Chennai, ranked 21st overall, comes a close second in Indian surveilled cities, while Delhi is a distant third at 33rd.

However, Hyderabad may be gloating over a dubious honour.

Eighteen of the top 20 cities in the list are located in China, while third-ranked London is the only city situated outside of China apart from Hyderabad. In the top 50 rankings, 34 cities are in China, two – Moscow and St Petersburg – are in Russia, and Baghdad is located in strife-torn Iraq. All three countries have been classified as “authoritarian regimes” in the Economist Intelligence Unit’s 2019 Democracy Index.

Taiyuan in China is the most surveilled city, with over 4.6 lakh cameras keeping an eye on nearly 39 lakh people. This translates to around 120 CCTVs for 1,000 people – the highest ratio among the 50 cities.

China’s capital Beijing is ranked 5th while financial nerve-centre Shanghai comes 12th in the list. Notably, Wuhan, the reported epicentre of coronavirus, is ranked 23rd in the list and Urumqi, the capital of the restive Xinjiang province, is at 13th place.

No correlation between crime rates and CCTVs

The Comparitech report notes the primary argument in favour of CCTV surveillance: Improved law enforcement and crime prevention. However, the evidence suggested by the report points to no correlation between CCTV cameras and crime rates.

“A higher number of cameras just barely correlates with a lower crime index,” the report reads, suggesting that more cameras do not necessarily mean reduced number of crimes. Case in point: Taiyuan, London and Baghdad – all have a high crime index score compared to their CCTVs per 1000 people. Crime index is a range between 0 and 100 with 0 denoting negligible crime rates and 100 meaning totally unsafe.

Coming to Hyderabad: It has a crime index of 43.46 despite its high number of CCTVs.

Privacy concerns remain

The Hyderabad Police have been hailed on the internet for employing CCTV surveillance. However, that surveillance could infringe upon the privacy of citizens is an issue still largely unaddressed by policymakers. “The fact is that live video surveillance is ramping up worldwide,” the report says, adding that face recognition technology used in China has been utilised to restrict public transport for people.

M Nageswara Rao, former interim director of CBI, has issued a word of caution against the Orwellian idea of surveillance. Taking to Twitter, he said that if the State is allowed to act like a Big Brother, it would be time to write an obituary to democracy.

“Trampling Right to Anonymity, Right to Privacy and Freedom of Movement by CCTV surveillance of public places is an issue of extraordinary importance that seems to have escaped freedom lovers.

12,29,"NEW DELHI:An Indian court has summoned Alibaba and its founder Jack Ma in a case in which a former employee in India says he was wrongfully fired after objecting to what he saw as censorship and fake news on company apps, documents seen by Reuters showed.

The case comes weeks after India cited security concerns in banning Alibaba’s UC News, UC Browser and 57 other Chinese apps after a clash between the two countries’ forces on their border.

Following the ban, which China has criticized, India sought written answers from all affected companies, including whether they censored content or acted for any foreign government.

In court filings dated July 20 and previously not reported, the former employee of Alibaba’s UC Web, Pushpandra Singh Parmar, alleges the company used to censor content seen as unfavourable to China and its apps UC Browser and UC News showcased false news “to cause social and political turmoil”.

Civil Judge Sonia Sheokand of a district court in Gurugram, a satellite city of India’s capital, New Delhi, has issued summons for Alibaba, Jack Ma and about a dozen individuals or company units, asking them to appear in court or through a lawyer on July 29, court documents showed.

The judge has also sought written responses from the company and its executives within 30 days, according to the summons.

UC India said in a statement it had been “unwavering in its commitment to the India market and the welfare of its local employees, and its policies are in compliance with local laws. We are unable to comment on ongoing litigation”.

Alibaba representatives did not respond to requests for comment from the Chinese company or on behalf of Jack Ma.

Parmar, who worked as an associate director at the UC Web office in Gurugram until October 2017 and is seeking $268,000 in damages, referred Reuters queries to his lawyer, Atul Ahlawat, who declined to comment saying the matter was sub judice.

The court case is the latest hurdle for Alibaba in India after the Indian government’s app ban, following which UC Web has started laying off some staff in India.

Before the apps were banned, the UC Browser had been downloaded at least 689 million times in India, while UC News had 79.8 million downloads, most during 2017 and 2018, data from analytics firm Sensor Tower showed.

ALLEGATIONS IN COURT

India has said it banned the 59 apps after it received “credible inputs” that such apps posed a threat to India’s sovereignty. Its IT minister said the decision was taken to safeguard citizens’ data and public order.

In more than 200 pages of court filings, reviewed by Reuters, former employee Parmar included clippings of some posts showcased on the UC News app that he alleged were false.

One post from 2017 was headlined in Hindi: “2,000-rupee notes to be banned from midnight today”. Another headline of a 2018 post said: “Just now: War broke out between India and Pakistan” and contained description of firing across the disputed border between the countries.

Reuters could not independently verify the veracity of the claims in the court filing. India did not ban its 2,000-rupee currency note and no war occurred between India and Pakistan in 2018.

The lawsuit also contains a “sensitive words list” with key words in Hindi and English like “India-China border” and “Sino-India war” that the court filing alleges were used by UC Web to censor content on its platforms in India.

“In order to control any news related content to be published against China was automatically/manually rejected by an audit system evolved for this purpose,” the filing said.

14,2,"Monsoon news: Many districts in Bihar flooded as most of the rivers in the state are in spate

The flood situation in Bihar has worsened after continuous heavy rain in the state for the past few days. Seven people have died due flood-related incidents so far and over 10.6 lakh in the state are affected. Large swathes of land are under flood waters. Helicopters of the Indian Air Force have been deployed in the worst affected districts of Darbhanga, East and West Champaran, Madhubani and Gopalganj to drop food, drinking water and other relief material.

According to the Bihar disaster management department, 22 teams of the State and National Disaster Response Force have been deployed in West and East Champaran, Sitamarhi, Sheohar, Supaul, Kishanganj, Darbhanga, Muzaffarpur, Gopalganj, and Khagaria. Several rivers such as the Baghmati, Burhi Gandak, Kamlabalan, Lalbakeya, Adhwara, Khiroi, Mahananda and Ghaghra are in spate causing extensive flooding.

Over 35 people in East Champaran district had a narrow escape after the engine of their boat malfunctioned during rescue operations.

The chief minister's outburst at Mr Kumawat came after Health Minister Mangal Pandey complained of non-cooperation from the officer. Mr Pandey, who was replying to Nitish Kumar's queries on low rate of testing, reportedly told him that his health commissioner does not listen to him.

It was at this point that the Chief Minister flared up and threatened the commisisoner to perform or be ready to face the action.

But sources say Nitish Kumar -- who has been reviewing the situation daily -- was trying to pin the blame on Mr Kumawat.

Leader of Opposition Tejasvi Yadav, who has led the attack on the chief minister over the handling of the pandemic, claimed that the Mr Kumar showdown was for optics to present a good image to the public ahead of the assembly elections. ""Everyone knows Nitish Kumar just wants to conduct elections at a time when the state has slowed down testing and tracing and today everyone is paying the price,"" he said.

On Friday, the Patna High Court directed Bihar government to furnish details of steps it has taken to deal with Covid-19 pandemic getting worse in the state.

Those visible in the video were not wearing face masks - mandatory in public spaces during the COVID-19 crisis - and many were sitting in apparent violation of social distancing rules.

Today's video emerged as Rajasthan Governor Kalraj Mishra received a fresh proposal from Ashok Gehlot to start the Assembly session on July 31, with the COVID outbreak listed as the agenda.

An earlier proposal was turned down by Mr Mishra on Friday, prompting the Chief Minister and his MLAs to head out from the Fairmont and hold a four-hour long protest at the Governor's residence, where they shouted slogans in support of Mr Gehlot and accused Mr Mishra of acting under BJP pressure.

On Saturday a BJP delegation led by Rajasthan BJP chief Satish Poonia and the Leader of the Opposition, Gulab Chand Kataria, met the Governor and hit out at the Congress for threatening the Governor and declared the state was heading to a ""constitutional crisis"".

The protests at the Governor's residence came hours after the rebels, led by Sachin Pilot, secured a temporary reprieve from the Rajasthan High Court, which said they could not be disqualified, as the Congress had hoped, until the question of the Speaker's powers is decided.

The Chief Minister has been pressing for an Assembly session so he can hold a trust vote and prove his majority; should Mr Gehlot win the vote, his government cannot be challenged for the next six months.

For now the Congress is just one past the majority mark of 101 in the 200-member Assembly. Team Pilot claims the support of 30 MLAs, but so far, the evidence points to only 19.

The BJP has 72 and the opposition as a whole, including smaller parties and independent members, has 97 at the moment.

The Congress had hoped to disqualify the rebels, thereby bringing down the majority mark and making Mr Gehlot's government more secure.

Mr Thackeray recalled that the last time when he had gone to Ayodhya, he was stopped from performing ''aarti'' at the Saryu river there since the COVID-19 pandemic spread had just started.

""Before that I had seen huge crowds on the river banks. Ram Mandir is a matter of faith. How can you stop people from going there?"" he asked.

19,8,"Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has coronavirus

Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who on Saturday confirmed that he had contracted the COVID-19 virus, posted a video on Sunday morning in which he described himself as ""absolutely fine"" and urged all those showing symptoms of the coronavirus to get themselves tested, reassuring them that ""there is no need to fear"".

In a 75-second video uploaded to his Twitter account, Mr Chouhan is seen dressed in a blue hospital gown and sitting up in a bed in Bhopal's Chirayu Hospital, where he was admitted Saturday afternoon. A second video showed him watching a TV while two medical staff stood nearby.

""I am absolutely fine, my friends. The dedication of coronavirus warriors, who selflessly risk their lives, is praiseworthy. I salute all coronavirus warriors of the state who are working for their patients,"" Mr Chouhan said in the first video.

Stressing that ""there is no need to fear"" on testing positive for the virus, the Chief Minister urged people showing symptoms of the coronavirus to get themselves tested as soon as possible.

""If you are infected, there is no need to fear. Do not hide symptoms but tell doctors immediately, so treatment can be started. Timely treatment will make you healthy,"" he said.

On Saturday Mr Chouhan tweeted that he had tested positive for the virus despite his best efforts to avoid infection and warned people that ""just a little carelessness invites the coronavirus"".

Today the Chief Minister repeated his warnings from yesterday, when he also urged people to follow guidelines, such as social distancing and the use of face masks.

""Keep two metres distance, wash your hands frequently and wear face masks - these are the biggest weapons we have to avoid the coronavirus. I appeal to all people - use these weapons for yourself and your loved ones,"" he said.

""All of you be careful, stay safe and healthy. This is what I pray to God,"" Mr Chouhan added.

Madhya Pradesh has nearly 27,000 COVID-19 cases, of which more than 7,600 are active and 799 are deaths linked to the virus.

India has recorded a surge in COVID-19 cases in the past weeks, with over 45,000 new cases detected every day since July 23. The total number of confirmed coronavirus cases is rapidly approaching 14 lakh; of these more than 4.67 lakh are active cases and over 32,000 are deaths linked to the virus.

The spike in cases, coinciding with the staggered relaxation of lockdown guidelines in non-containment zones of the country, has propelled India to third on the list of most affected nations.

20,11,"Uddhav Thackeray said he hadn't switched sides, but only entered into an alliance.

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has dared the opposition to topple his government and said though it is a ""three-wheeler"" government, he is firmly in control of its steering wheel.

Mr Thackeray, who is also president of the Shiv Sena, said his alliance partners - NCP and Congress - are ""positive"" and the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is benefitting from their experience.

He also took an aim at the Centre's ambitious Mumbai- Ahmedabad bullet train project, saying he would rather prefer such a high speed link between the state capital and Nagpur.

""The future of my government is not in the hands of the opposition. The steering is in my hands. A three-wheeler (auto-rickshaw) is a vehicle of poor people. The other two are sitting behind,"" Mr Thackeray said in the second and last part of his interview published in Shiv Sena mouthpiece ''Saamana'' on Sunday, ahead of his 60th birthday on Monday.

""Why wait for September-October as is being speculated. Topple the government right now since you get pleasure in toppling. Some people derive pleasure in constructive work while some are happy in destruction. If you feel happy in destruction, go ahead,"" he said.

""You say the MVA government is formed against the democratic principles but when you topple it, is it democracy?"" the chief minister asked.

Notably, his predecessor Devendra Fadnavis earlier compared the ruling MVA, comprising the Shiv Sena and its ideological opponents Congress and NCP, with a three-wheeler, auto-rickshaw, and raised doubts over its stability.

To a question, Mr Thackeray said he hadn't switched sides, but only entered into an alliance.

""I did this because the purpose with which I had joined hands earlier turned out to be hollow,"" he said.

Asserting that the party ideology is important, he said, ""Show me one leader who has reached the top position in the party which he has defected to. It is all use and throw policy.""

Targeting the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project, he said, ""A three-wheeler is a vehicle of poor people. If I have to choose between a bullet train and an auto-rickshaw,I will chose the auto-rickshaw. If people don't want a bullet train, then it will not happen,"" he said.

""If my government is a three-wheeler, it is moving in a proper direction, why should you have stomachache?"" he said in a veiled attack at the opposition BJP.

Mr Thackeray said when he attended the NDA meeting last time, ""there were 30 to 35 wheels like a railway train"".

The chief minister said he would scrap projects which people feel are unwanted.

He said MoUs worth Rs 16,000 crore signed recently are in initial stages and more investments are on the anvil.

""If the state requires a bullet train, I would demand a bullet train to connect Mumbai and Nagpur. I would like a bullet train which connects my state capital and the second capital. The feeling of neglect among people of Vidarbha would be wiped out. Just like the Mumbai Nagpur Samruddhi corridor, I would be happy with a bullet train,"" he said.

He also said the Congress's grievance of being neglected in the three-party alliance government was resolved after his meeting with the state Congress leaders.

""I have good coordination with (NCP chief) Sharad Pawar. I make a phone call to (Congress president) Sonia Gandhi some times,"" he said.

Mr Thackeray asserted that the tripartite MVA government was functioning well.

""I admit that in the last few months, face-to-face meetings haven't happened. One more minister is coronavirus positive now after Jitendra Awhad, Ashok Chavan and Dhananjay Munde. All ministers are in touch with each other over phone or through video conferencing,"" he said.

Mr Thackeray admitted the state's economy is not in good shape, but noted the entire world is facing such a crisis.

He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked all chief ministers not to announce any waivers or subsidies as populist measures due to which the economy would be further burdened.

In an apparent reference to his criticism over not moving out during the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr Thackeray said discussions and deliberations as well as signing of MoUs were being done by him sitting at home.

Asked about the participation of Chinese firms in investing in the state, he said more than the presence of Chinese firms in the recent MoUs, what is important is whether Chinese investments should remain in the country or not.

""During a video conference meeting with the prime minister, I had requested him to frame a national policy on doing business with China,"" he said.

Mr Thackeray also said his government had kept the MoUs with Chinese firms on hold.

""There should be a policy on whether Chinese companies should be allowed to do business in the country. If tomorrow, the situation improves and the Chinese prime minister is welcomed in India, why should we miss the business opportunities now?"" he asked.

The chief minister also rejected criticism that bureaucracy has an upper hand in his government.

22,16,"Monsoon news: Many districts in Bihar flooded as most of the rivers in the state are in spate

The flood situation in Bihar has worsened after continuous heavy rain in the state for the past few days. Seven people have died due flood-related incidents so far and over 10.6 lakh in the state are affected. Large swathes of land are under flood waters. Helicopters of the Indian Air Force have been deployed in the worst affected districts of Darbhanga, East and West Champaran, Madhubani and Gopalganj to drop food, drinking water and other relief material.

According to the Bihar disaster management department, 22 teams of the State and National Disaster Response Force have been deployed in West and East Champaran, Sitamarhi, Sheohar, Supaul, Kishanganj, Darbhanga, Muzaffarpur, Gopalganj, and Khagaria. Several rivers such as the Baghmati, Burhi Gandak, Kamlabalan, Lalbakeya, Adhwara, Khiroi, Mahananda and Ghaghra are in spate causing extensive flooding.

Over 35 people in East Champaran district had a narrow escape after the engine of their boat malfunctioned during rescue operations. Rescuers of NDRF noticed that the boat was stuck on the swollen Gandak river. Guided by senior NDRF personnel, the group was taken to safety. Commandant Vijay Sinha of 9 Battalion, NDRF said, the boat's engine had failed and the people onboard somehow managed to save it from drowning with the help of a tree for more than two hours.

Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Saturday held a cabinet meeting via video conference to review the flood situation.

Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar - criticised by the Opposition over the poor handling of coronavirus pandemic -- lashed out at Principal Secretary Uday Singh Kumawat during a cabinet meeting on Saturday, sources told NDTV.

""Either you perform or we start action against you,"" Mr Kumar is learnt to have told the official.

The chief minister's outburst at Mr Kumawat came after Health Minister Mangal Pandey complained of non-cooperation from the officer. Mr Pandey, who was replying to Nitish Kumar's queries on low rate of testing, reportedly told him that his health commissioner does not listen to him.

It was at this point that the Chief Minister flared up and threatened the commisisoner to perform or be ready to face the action.

But sources say Nitish Kumar -- who has been reviewing the situation daily -- was trying to pin the blame on Mr Kumawat.

Leader of Opposition Tejasvi Yadav, who has led the attack on the chief minister over the handling of the pandemic, claimed that the Mr Kumar showdown was for optics to present a good image to the public ahead of the assembly elections. ""Everyone knows Nitish Kumar just wants to conduct elections at a time when the state has slowed down testing and tracing and today everyone is paying the price,"" he said.

On Friday, the Patna High Court directed Bihar government to furnish details of steps it has taken to deal with Covid-19 pandemic getting worse in the state.

Besides, it also sought to know about number of isolation centres, facilities for patients, figures relating to availability of doctors and paramedical staff in the hospitals and also the number of ventilators and oxygen cylinders.

The bench also queried the state government on procedure being followed for disposal of dead bodies, count of patients suffering from COVID-19 and reasons for not admitting patients in the districts and referring them to Patna for treatment.

Rajasthan Congress MLAs loyal to Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot in his battle with rebel leader Sachin Pilot spent yet another weekend practicing yoga at Jaipur's luxurious Fairmont Hotel, where they have been sequestered since the crisis began.

A video released by news agency ANI on Sunday showed the MLAs - dressed in t-shirts and tracksuits/shorts - on sheets and mats laid out in a concrete courtyard, with some stretching and others in what appeared to be a meditative pose.

Those visible in the video were not wearing face masks - mandatory in public spaces during the COVID-19 crisis - and many were sitting in apparent violation of social distancing rules.

Last week videos of the MLAs attending film screenings, singing Bollywood movie songs, playing group games and even taking cooking tips from the five-star resort's executive chef went viral.

Today's video emerged as Rajasthan Governor Kalraj Mishra received a fresh proposal from Ashok Gehlot to start the Assembly session on July 31, with the COVID outbreak listed as the agenda.

An earlier proposal was turned down by Mr Mishra on Friday, prompting the Chief Minister and his MLAs to head out from the Fairmont and hold a four-hour long protest at the Governor's residence, where they shouted slogans in support of Mr Gehlot and accused Mr Mishra of acting under BJP pressure.

On Saturday a BJP delegation led by Rajasthan BJP chief Satish Poonia and the Leader of the Opposition, Gulab Chand Kataria, met the Governor and hit out at the Congress for threatening the Governor and declared the state was heading to a ""constitutional crisis"".

The protests at the Governor's residence came hours after the rebels, led by Sachin Pilot, secured a temporary reprieve from the Rajasthan High Court, which said they could not be disqualified, as the Congress had hoped, until the question of the Speaker's powers is decided.

The Chief Minister has been pressing for an Assembly session so he can hold a trust vote and prove his majority; should Mr Gehlot win the vote, his government cannot be challenged for the next six months.

For now the Congress is just one past the majority mark of 101 in the 200-member Assembly. Team Pilot claims the support of 30 MLAs, but so far, the evidence points to only 19.

The BJP has 72 and the opposition as a whole, including smaller parties and independent members, has 97 at the moment.

The Congress had hoped to disqualify the rebels, thereby bringing down the majority mark and making Mr Gehlot's government more secure.

26,25,"Paleogenomics has amounted to a ""revolution"" in understanding disease history. (Istock)

As the novel coronavirus pandemic reshapes lives and entire economies, historians tell us this is not the first time. The earliest written records of tiny infectious organisms overhauling human societies stretch back as far as the Plague of Justinian in A.D. 541, which is thought to have killed up to 50 million people, or even the earlier Antonine Plague in A.D. 165, which left 5 million dead, a substantial portion of the world then.

Now, paleogenomics - a nascent field that studies DNA in remnants of ancient teeth - is rewriting the first chapter of humanity's entanglement with disease to thousands of years older than originally thought. The growing evidence suggests that these first epidemics forced societies to make epoch-defining transformations.

""In the case of covid-19 [the disease caused by the coronavirus], we see similar processes, but we are watching it unfold in real time,"" said Anne Stone, regents professor in the School of Human Evolution and Social Change at Arizona State University, whose focus is anthropological genetics. She also has studied evidence of tuberculosis in ancient DNA.

Paleogenomics, which adapts high-end medical tools similar to some now being used to track the coronavirus, has amounted to a ""revolution"" in understanding disease history, says Maria Spyrou, a microbiologist at the Max Planck Institute in Germany.

""This is one of the things that we can now start saying,"" said Spyrou, adding that where historical records are lacking, DNA evidence offers the possibility of filling in gaps, sometimes in surprising ways.

""One of them is plague,"" Spyrou said. ""Until 2015, we thought that plague was maybe a 3,000-year-old disease.""

Scientists and archaeologists now believe, however, that the plague bacteria, which caused the medieval Black Death that killed up to half of Europe's population, infected humans roughly 5,000 years ago in the Stone Age. The bacteria, after it had entered the bloodstream and likely killed the host, circulated into the pulp chamber of teeth, which kept its DNA insulated from millennia of environmental wear and tear. In the past decade, scientists have been able to extract and analyze that DNA.

The Stone Age plague was, however, an ancestor with a slightly different genetic identity. Tracking how those differences evolve helps infectious-disease biologists better understand what causes disease and how to prepare for current outbreaks. The plague bacteria in the Stone Age, for example, lacked the genes necessary to jump from fleas to humans, which likely spread the Black Death widely.

Without the flea gene, the disease probably used another animal transmitter that came into contact with humans. In 2018, a University of Copenhagen team published the first evidence, based on early data three years before, that the ancient plague bacteria, found in a Swedish settlement, had the power to kill and may have threatened life in the age's ""mega-settlements"" that could spread diseases quickly.

""It probably was the first pandemic,"" said Simon Rasmussen, a genomicist at the university and lead researcher on the plague study. In the Stone Age, also called the Neolithic period, humans made unprecedented moves to gather in large settlements with up to 10,000 people in close quarters with animals and virtually no sanitation. ""It's the textbook place of where you could have a new pathogen,"" he said.

Paleogenomics has also allowed archaeologists to fill in one of the biggest silences in the archaeological record: disease. Pathogens rarely leave traces on bones, and populations without writing could die out without any readable record of the cause. With the ability to read traces of DNA preserved in teeth, historians are learning about the organisms inside ancient humans.

Kristian Kristiansen, a University of Copenhagen archaeologist and a co-author of the plague study, believes his group's research illuminates the causes of a Stone Age demographic transformation, called the Neolithic decline, which archaeologists have long studied.

Settlements at the time were disappearing faster than they were appearing, and within a few hundred years, most of the population had been replaced by migrants from the Eurasian Steppe. Researchers had only ever hypothesized that disease may have played a role in crippling the native population before it was overtaken, but now they have evidence, Kristiansen says.

""The steppe migrations would not have succeeded without the plague . . . and [those living in what is now Europe] would not all have spoken Indo-European languages,"" Kristiansen said. ""Later prehistory has been turned upside down to say the least.""

In 2018, a paleogenomics team analyzed ancient teeth from Neolithic sites in present-day Germany and discovered the hepatitis B virus stretched back at least 7,000 years. Another study the same year extended our knowledge of the history of parvovirus B19 from a few hundred years to 6,900 years. Parvovirus B19 causes a mild rash in humans and leads to outbreaks in the United States every few years

In February, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology published evidence that types of Salmonella bacteria, which sicken about a million people in the United States every year, were afflicting humans 6,500 years ago. Microbiologist Felix Key identified Salmonella DNA in teeth recovered from burial sites near the Volga River in present-day Russia, where archaeological evidence has shown that humans began to abandon foraging for pastoral living. The Salmonella DNA in their teeth is the first evidence, Key says, that the adoption of this lifestyle in close contact with animals may have introduced pathogens to humans.

""This ancient DNA could give us the means to prove or disprove the hypothesis that the Neolithic revolution was the major event for introducing diseases into humans,"" said Key, who is now at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History. ""My hunch is that it did facilitate the disease, because humans and animals were co-housed.""

Like many paleogenomicists, Key uses dentist tools and dons what looks like a hazmat suit that blocks possible DNA contamination from teeth recovered from settlements thousands of years older than the Roman Empire.

New methods of extracting DNA that were developed for medical purposes have made paleogenomics possible in the past decade. After using dentist tools to recover and pulverize material locked inside a tooth, molecular biologists use a technique called ""shotgun sequencing"" to extract all genetic material without needing to know what to look for. Decrypting the data then requires that bioinformatic specialists can match the genetic identities to known pathogens. As the disease database grows, it becomes easier to identify signals from noise. Archaeologists then have the task of putting human disease into historical context.

The process is expensive, and it's dominated by labs in Europe with equipment and funding. Conducting a complete survey of teeth can cost upward of $1 million. That depends, still, on a team's good fortune in finding enough ancient teeth that have experienced the right conditions over millennia to preserve pathogen DNA. In the study of the Salmonella bacteria, Key's team analyzed 3,000 samples and found just eight with preserved Salmonella bacteria.

Rasmussen, of the Copenhagen plague study, said that, while he is fairly certain his team's evidence describes the oldest human pandemic, more DNA samples must be found and analyzed. The DNA used in his study come from just one small settlement in the area of modern-day Sweden. To prove a pandemic, Rasmussen said, scientists will need to find DNA evidence in some larger sites - in other parts of Europe.

Even so, Stone said, paleogenomics has shown that humans have been in ""an arms race with pathogens"" for thousands of years.

""Periodically, pathogens jump into humans,"" she said, ""and it's really easy to become complacent when you don't happen to have a pathogen affecting large segments of your population at the moment. But you let those resources go at your peril, which we're seeing right now.""

27,27,"A Gurgaon court has summoned Chinese company Alibaba and its founder Jack Ma.

A Gurgaon court has summoned Chinese company Alibaba and its founder Jack Ma in a case filed by a former employee who alleges he was wrongfully fired after objecting to what he saw as censorship and fake news on company apps, documents seen by Reuters showed.

The case comes weeks after India cited security concerns in banning Alibaba's UC News, UC Browser and 57 other Chinese apps after a clash between the two countries' forces on their border.

Following the ban, India sought written answers from all affected companies, including whether they censored content or acted for any foreign government.

In court filings dated July 20 and previously not reported, the former employee of Alibaba's UC Web, Pushpandra Singh Parmar, alleges the company used to censor content seen as unfavourable to China and its apps UC Browser and UC News showcased false news ""to cause social and political turmoil"".

Civil Judge Sonia Sheokand of a district court in Gurugram has issued summons for Alibaba, Jack Ma and about a dozen individuals or company units, asking them to appear in court or through a lawyer on July 29, court documents showed.

The judge has also sought written responses from the company and its executives within 30 days, according to the summons.

UC India said in a statement it had been ""unwavering in its commitment to the India market and the welfare of its local employees, and its policies are in compliance with local laws. We are unable to comment on ongoing litigation"".

Alibaba representatives did not respond to requests for comment from the Chinese company or on behalf of Jack Ma.

Mr Parmar, who worked as an associate director at the UC Web office in Gurugram until October 2017 and is seeking Rs 2 Crore (approx.) in damages, referred Reuters queries to his lawyer, Atul Ahlawat, who declined to comment saying the matter was sub judice.

The court case is the latest hurdle for Alibaba in India after the Indian government's app ban, following which UC Web has started laying off some staff in India.

Before the apps were banned, the UC Browser had been downloaded at least 689 million times in India, while UC News had 79.8 million downloads, most during 2017 and 2018, data from analytics firm Sensor Tower showed.

India has said it banned the 59 apps after it received ""credible inputs"" that such apps posed a threat to India's sovereignty.

IT minister said the decision was taken to safeguard citizens' data and public order.

In more than 200 pages of court filings, reviewed by Reuters, former employee Mr Parmar included clippings of some posts showcased on the UC News app that he alleged were false.

One post from 2017 was headlined in Hindi: ""2,000-rupee notes to be banned from midnight today"". Another headline of a 2018 post said: ""Just now: War broke out between India and Pakistan"" and contained description of firing across the disputed border between the countries.

Reuters could not independently verify the veracity of the claims in the court filing. India did not ban its 2,000-rupee currency note and no war occurred between India and Pakistan in 2018.

The lawsuit also contains a ""sensitive words list"" with key words in Hindi and English like ""India-China border"" and ""Sino-India war"" that the court filing alleges were used by UC Web to censor content on its platforms in India.

""In order to control any news related content to be published against China was automatically/manually rejected by an audit system evolved for this purpose,"" the filing said.

Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who on Saturday confirmed that he had contracted the COVID-19 virus, posted a video on Sunday morning in which he described himself as ""absolutely fine"" and urged all those showing symptoms of the coronavirus to get themselves tested, reassuring them that ""there is no need to fear"".

In a 75-second video uploaded to his Twitter account, Mr Chouhan is seen dressed in a blue hospital gown and sitting up in a bed in Bhopal's Chirayu Hospital, where he was admitted Saturday afternoon. A second video showed him watching a TV while two medical staff stood nearby.

""I am absolutely fine, my friends. The dedication of coronavirus warriors, who selflessly risk their lives, is praiseworthy. I salute all coronavirus warriors of the state who are working for their patients,"" Mr Chouhan said in the first video.

Stressing that ""there is no need to fear"" on testing positive for the virus, the Chief Minister urged people showing symptoms of the coronavirus to get themselves tested as soon as possible.

""If you are infected, there is no need to fear. Do not hide symptoms but tell doctors immediately, so treatment can be started. Timely treatment will make you healthy,"" he said.

On Saturday Mr Chouhan tweeted that he had tested positive for the virus despite his best efforts to avoid infection and warned people that ""just a little carelessness invites the coronavirus"".

Today the Chief Minister repeated his warnings from yesterday, when he also urged people to follow guidelines, such as social distancing and the use of face masks.

""Keep two metres distance, wash your hands frequently and wear face masks - these are the biggest weapons we have to avoid the coronavirus. I appeal to all people - use these weapons for yourself and your loved ones,"" he said.

""All of you be careful, stay safe and healthy. This is what I pray to God,"" Mr Chouhan added.

Madhya Pradesh has nearly 27,000 COVID-19 cases, of which more than 7,600 are active and 799 are deaths linked to the virus.

India has recorded a surge in COVID-19 cases in the past weeks, with over 45,000 new cases detected every day since July 23. The total number of confirmed coronavirus cases is rapidly approaching 14 lakh; of these more than 4.67 lakh are active cases and over 32,000 are deaths linked to the virus.

The spike in cases, coinciding with the staggered relaxation of lockdown guidelines in non-containment zones of the country, has propelled India to third on the list of most affected nations.

29,30,"Uddhav Thackeray said he hadn't switched sides, but only entered into an alliance.

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has dared the opposition to topple his government and said though it is a ""three-wheeler"" government, he is firmly in control of its steering wheel.

Mr Thackeray, who is also president of the Shiv Sena, said his alliance partners - NCP and Congress - are ""positive"" and the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is benefitting from their experience.

He also took an aim at the Centre's ambitious Mumbai- Ahmedabad bullet train project, saying he would rather prefer such a high speed link between the state capital and Nagpur.

""The future of my government is not in the hands of the opposition. The steering is in my hands. A three-wheeler (auto-rickshaw) is a vehicle of poor people. The other two are sitting behind,"" Mr Thackeray said in the second and last part of his interview published in Shiv Sena mouthpiece ''Saamana'' on Sunday, ahead of his 60th birthday on Monday.

""Why wait for September-October as is being speculated. Topple the government right now since you get pleasure in toppling. Some people derive pleasure in constructive work while some are happy in destruction. If you feel happy in destruction, go ahead,"" he said.

""You say the MVA government is formed against the democratic principles but when you topple it, is it democracy?"" the chief minister asked.

Notably, his predecessor Devendra Fadnavis earlier compared the ruling MVA, comprising the Shiv Sena and its ideological opponents Congress and NCP, with a three-wheeler, auto-rickshaw, and raised doubts over its stability.

To a question, Mr Thackeray said he hadn't switched sides, but only entered into an alliance.

""I did this because the purpose with which I had joined hands earlier turned out to be hollow,"" he said.

Asserting that the party ideology is important, he said, ""Show me one leader who has reached the top position in the party which he has defected to. It is all use and throw policy.""

Targeting the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project, he said, ""A three-wheeler is a vehicle of poor people. If I have to choose between a bullet train and an auto-rickshaw,I will chose the auto-rickshaw. If people don't want a bullet train, then it will not happen,"" he said.

""If my government is a three-wheeler, it is moving in a proper direction, why should you have stomachache?"" he said in a veiled attack at the opposition BJP.

Mr Thackeray said when he attended the NDA meeting last time, ""there were 30 to 35 wheels like a railway train"".

The chief minister said he would scrap projects which people feel are unwanted.

He said MoUs worth Rs 16,000 crore signed recently are in initial stages and more investments are on the anvil.

""If the state requires a bullet train, I would demand a bullet train to connect Mumbai and Nagpur. I would like a bullet train which connects my state capital and the second capital. The feeling of neglect among people of Vidarbha would be wiped out. Just like the Mumbai Nagpur Samruddhi corridor, I would be happy with a bullet train,"" he said.

He also said the Congress's grievance of being neglected in the three-party alliance government was resolved after his meeting with the state Congress leaders.

""I have good coordination with (NCP chief) Sharad Pawar. I make a phone call to (Congress president) Sonia Gandhi some times,"" he said.

Mr Thackeray asserted that the tripartite MVA government was functioning well.

""I admit that in the last few months, face-to-face meetings haven't happened. One more minister is coronavirus positive now after Jitendra Awhad, Ashok Chavan and Dhananjay Munde. All ministers are in touch with each other over phone or through video conferencing,"" he said.

Mr Thackeray admitted the state's economy is not in good shape, but noted the entire world is facing such a crisis.

He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked all chief ministers not to announce any waivers or subsidies as populist measures due to which the economy would be further burdened.

In an apparent reference to his criticism over not moving out during the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr Thackeray said discussions and deliberations as well as signing of MoUs were being done by him sitting at home.

Asked about the participation of Chinese firms in investing in the state, he said more than the presence of Chinese firms in the recent MoUs, what is important is whether Chinese investments should remain in the country or not.

""During a video conference meeting with the prime minister, I had requested him to frame a national policy on doing business with China,"" he said.

Mr Thackeray also said his government had kept the MoUs with Chinese firms on hold.

""There should be a policy on whether Chinese companies should be allowed to do business in the country. If tomorrow, the situation improves and the Chinese prime minister is welcomed in India, why should we miss the business opportunities now?"" he asked.

The chief minister also rejected criticism that bureaucracy has an upper hand in his government.

""The government is the decision-maker and bureaucracy implements the decisions,"" he added.",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/maharashtra-chief-minister-uddhav-thackeray-maha-vikas-aghadi-mva-governments-steering-wheel-is-in-my-hands-2268996,Covid,/Centre:Mumbai,Centre,Mumbai,,"Maharashtra Government's ""Steering Wheel"" In My Hands: Uddhav Thackeray"

The much-awaited Financial Action Task Force (FATF) mutual evaluation of India’s anti-money laundering regime and legal measures framed to check financial crimes, scheduled for this year, has been postponed till early next year in view of the coronavirus pandemic, officials said.

They said the on-site review to be conducted by experts of the global body was scheduled to begin in September-October but the FATF secretariat in Paris has conveyed to India that the review is being tentatively pushed to January-February next year.

The FATF is a global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog that sets international standards to prevent illegal activities in the economic and financial channels of a country and its inter-connected linkages across the world.

It conducts “peer reviews of each member on an ongoing basis to assess levels of implementation of the FATF recommendations and provides an in-depth description and analysis of each country’s system for preventing criminal abuse of the financial system.” The review of India’s anti-money laundering and terrorist financing regime was scheduled for this year as part of a regular review cycle after 10 years. The last such review was done in June 2010, a senior officer in an anti-money laundering agency said.

The FATF, post this review, had said in 2013 that “India had made significant progress in addressing deficiencies identified in its mutual evaluation report and (the FATF) decided that the country should be removed from the regular follow-up process.” India has set up a joint working group comprising 22 central investigation, intelligence gathering and regulatory agencies to make presentations and brief the FATF experts, drawn from various countries, this time.

Some of the prominent agencies in this grouping supervised by the Department of Revenue under the finance ministry include the CBI, ED, Income Tax Department, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), Customs, market regulator SEBI, banking regulator RBI and insurance regulator IRDAI. The Union government had also deputed Rahul Navin, a 1993-batch Indian Revenue Service officer of the Income Tax Department, to work as an officer on special duty (OSD) with the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to take these processes forward.

Navin has authored a book, ‘Information Exchange and Tax Transparency: Tackling Global Tax Evasion and Avoidance’, and served in the international taxation wing of the tax department and worked closely with the OECD, another reputed global economic body.

The ED is the nodal agency to undertake investigations under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in the country. A senior Union finance ministry official said all preparations to brief the FATF reviewing group were nearing completion when the Covid-19 outbreak happened.

“We have been informed by the FATF that it has postponed the mutual evaluation of many jurisdictions scheduled this year including that of India due to the ongoing Covid-19 restrictions. It is expected that the new dates will be for early next year,” the officer told PTI.

The FATF too made a public declaration in this context.

“The gravity of the Covid-19 situation globally and the consequent Covid-19 related measures that countries have adopted, such as confinement and travel restrictions, are making it impossible for assessed jurisdictions and assessors alike to conduct on-site visits and in-person meetings. This situation has significantly impacted countries’ ability to actively participate in mutual evaluation and related follow-up processes.” “The FATF Plenary has therefore agreed to temporarily postpone all remaining FATF mutual evaluations and follow-up deadlines,” the FATF said.

It said India’s possible on-site period is “tbc (to be considered)”.

During the visit of FATF evaluators, the finance ministry officer said, India has prepared to present multiple dossiers of the action undertaken by it under the anti-money laundering law, criminal tax evasion probes and for strengthening the CFT (combating financing of terrorism) regime by the financial intelligence unit (FIU) and other agencies. The enactment of the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act in 2018, the anti-black money Act of 2015, amendments brought in the PMLA over the years, curbing tax evasion under indirect taxes by bringing in the GST (goods and services tax), new protocols to better regulate suspect transactions in banks and financial intermediaries and the 2016 demonetisation of two large currencies are part of the Indian presentation, another officer in a probe agency said. The high number of domestic and international attachment of assets under the PMLA and charge sheets filed by various probe agencies under criminal sections of the law against financial crimes and terror funding are also part of India’s presentation to the FATF review team, he said.

The new compliance regime brought in by the FIU for banks and other financial institutions to report suspect cash and counterfeit transactions will also be part of the presentation, he said.

The review takes about a year to finish and if all timelines are adhered to, the FATF will discuss the Indian legal system against financial crimes at its Plenary meeting in February, 2022 and subsequently issue a statement and recommendations about the country, the officer said.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fatf-review-of-india-s-anti-money-laundering-and-terror-financing-regime-pushed-to-2021-due-to-covid-19/story-HN26ZeE7UlSCCOmCSRmz9J.html,Murder,/Updated:Ghaziabad,Updated,Ghaziabad,2020-07-26 15:24:53+05:30,FATF review of India’s anti-money laundering and terror financing regime pushed to 2021 due to Covid-19

Bihar has conducted the lowest Covid-19 tests per million and has the highest positivity rate in the country, said Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav on Sunday.

Taking to Twitter, Yadav said Covid-19 testing per 10 lakh people in Bihar is the lowest in the country.

“In a densely populated state like Bihar, only 0.35 per cent of people have been tested so far. Only 3,508 people are being tested per 10 lakh, which is the lowest in the country. An average of 3,158 tests have been conducted daily in 140 days. Except for Antigen Tests for the last two weeks, there are hardly 3,000 tests in a day,” Yadav said in a tweet (translated from Hindi).

The Union Health Ministry had on Saturday said Tests Per Million (TPM) in the country stand at 11,485.

In a subsequent tweet, the Leader of Opposition Tejashwi Yadav said that the Covid-19 positivity rate in Bihar is the highest in the country.

“The positivity rate of Bihar in July is 12.54 per cent, which is the highest in the country. In the month of July, 159 people died in 25 days. That means six people are dying every day. Those who are dying without testing and treatment are not counted. The government should be serious now,” Yadav tweeted.

Union Health Ministry had on Saturday said that the mortality due to Covid-19 stands at 2.35 per cent.

Ace sprinter Srabani Nanda has not been a regular in the Indian athletics team for a while now but she is leaving no stone unturned to make a second Olympic appearance, spending whatever she has to train in far off Jamaica amid a raging pandemic. The 29-year-old Nanda became the first Indian track-and-field athlete to participate in a competition amid the COVID-19 pandemic, running the 100m race at the Velocity Fest meeting in Kingston earlier this week.

She has been based in Jamaica since the beginning of the year and is counts herself fortunate to have employers, who gave her the freedom to train with full salary. “I work with Hydropower Corporation of Odisha government, they give me salary and support to train full-time. Whatever is the (financial) gap, I manage myself and friends also help me,” she told PTI from Jamaica.

“I am here from the beginning of this season. I do train sometimes and compete sometimes. I chose to train at a better place no matter the struggles I have to face,” said Nanda, who has been taking part in athletic meets in Jamaica since 2017.

Representing the MVP Track club, she won heat two in 11.78 seconds for a third-place finish overall in the meet which also featured the likes of reigning Olympic champion Elaine Thompson and sprint great Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce.

Nanda’s last international medal -- a bronze in 4x100m relay -- came from the Asian Athletics Championships in 2017 held at the Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar.

Since then, she has not been a part of the Indian team, which competed in top meets like the Asian and World Championships in 2019.

She is, however, hopeful of making the cut for Tokyo Olympics, which will not been an easy task with the qualifying timings in both the 100m and 200m events (11.15sec and 22.80sec respectively) being well above her personal best.

“Right now I am training for both (100m and 200m). I am confident about both the events. I focus on myself and to do well is my priority. I have to be confident with hope,” she said when asked whether she truly sees herself making the cut for the Olympics next year.

Nanda competed in the 2016 Rio Olympics in the 200m event and finished sixth in her heat race. She has a personal bests of 11.45 and 23.07 seconds in 100m and 200m respectively.

Asked if competing in the middle of a pandemic was disconcerting, Nanda said she did not feel anything special.

“Now everywhere people are competing according to situations. Yes, we do maintain social distancing, it is compulsory and spectators are not allowed in the stadium when we raced,” she said.

Jamaica is one of the least COVID-19 affected countries in the world with just 116 active cases at present (837 total cases with 711 already recovered).

Asked about competing along with some of the world’s best sprinters like Thomson and Fraser-Pryce, she said, “Elaine Thomson is in my club MVP Track Club and all of them are good. It is a huge experience and I am learning a lot.” Asked if she will return to India to take part in the domestic events planned later this year, nanda said, “I am not sure about anything in this situation. My coach will decide, it depends on the situation.

Former US Open champion Samantha Stosur has decided to sit out the rest of 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic after becoming a mother last month but the 36-year-old Australian has vowed to return to court next year. Stosur recently announced this month that her partner Liz Astling gave birth to daughter Evie in June.

The women’s WTA Tour is scheduled to restart with the Palermo Ladies Open on August 3 after the Covid-19 outbreak forced the suspension of professional events in early March. The US Open and French Open Grand Slams are still on the 2020 calendar.

“With the schedule coming up, with COVID, with quarantine and with all the other things that you’re going to have to deal with, I’ve decided that I’m going to take the rest of the year off,” Stosur told Tennis Australia. “I’m going to stay here, enjoy being with my family, go through all those little milestones that Evie is going to have in the next six months and just really enjoy being home.”

Stosur reached a career-high ranking of fourth in 2011 and defeated Serena Williams in New York for her maiden Grand Slam singles title the same year. She hopes family bliss would work in her favour when she returns to playing.

“Many players have done this same thing and I think the resounding comment is ‘I actually played better and I enjoy it’ and you come off the court and you don’t worry about whether that was a bad loss, or whatever happened on court,” she said.

“Probably help relax me a little bit more as well because there is something bigger and essentially more important than that one tennis match that you’ve just played.

Scientists have identified a gene in humans which they say could be an essential player in the immune response against the novel coronavirus, an advance that may lead to better understanding and treatment of Covid-19.

The research, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, analysed variation of the genetic makeup of four young male patients with severe Covid-19 from two families, who did not have any pre-existing medical conditions that made them predisposed to the deadly disease. According to the scientists from Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands, the patients had variants of the gene TLR7, along with defects in the production of immune system molecules type I and II interferons.

They said the patients who were previously well before developing respiratory insufficiency due to severe Covid-19, required mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

A rapid clinical sequencing of all the genes performed in the study, and segregation in available family members, found that the variants of the TLR7 gene in the patients had a loss-of-function.

“In this case series of four young male patients with severe Covid-19, rare putative loss-of-function variants of X-chromosomal TLR7 were identified that were associated with impaired type I and II IFN responses,” the scientists wrote in the study.

The researchers explained that TLR-genes help produce a family of protein receptors on the surface of human cells that play an important role in the recognition of pathogens. They said these receptors recognise infectious agents like bacteria and viruses in the body and activate the immune system. “TLR7 triggers the production of so-called interferons, signaling proteins that are essential in the defense against virus infections,” the scientists explained.

Earlier research had noted that alterations in the TLR7 gene may result in hardly any of these receptor proteins from being produced. While TLR7 function had so far never been associated with an inborn error of immunity, the new findings, according to the scientists, indicate that its role is essential for protection from the novel coronavirus.

“So it seems that the virus can replicate undisturbed because the immune system does not get a message that the virus has invaded,” explained geneticist Alexander Hoischen, a co-author of the study. “Because TLR7, which must identify the intruder and subsequently activate the defense, is hardly present. That could be the reason for the severity of the disease in these brothers,” Hoischen said.

The researchers also come across another pair of young brothers who have fallen seriously ill with Covid-19, and admitted in the ICU for mechanical ventilation.

When the scientists investigated the genetic code of these two brothers, they again saw a mistake in the makeup of the TRL7 gene. “The effect on the gene is the same, however, because these brothers also do not make sufficient functional TLR7 protein. Suddenly we had four young people with a defect in the same gene, all of whom had fallen seriously ill from the SARS-CoV-2 virus,” Hoischen said.

The discovery, according to the scientists, not only provides more insight into the fundamental workings of the immune system, but it may also have important consequences for the treatment of severely ill Covid-19 patients.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/science/genetic-mutation-identified-that-may-make-some-people-more-vulnerable-to-covid-19/story-bzAaQ1AnlMtPAGQrU40jtK.html,Covid,/Updated:Ghaziabad,Updated,Ghaziabad,2020-07-26 15:07:28+05:30,Genetic mutation identified that may make some people more vulnerable to Covid-19

The country is unlocking really fast and with the coming unlock 3.0, more relaxations will be introduced. So Delhiites have resorted to buying essentials to be extra careful. But, with ample options available in terms of safety gear, many are getting confused. Here’s a guide to what you should buy and what should be its features.

Face Masks

“As the new study suggests the virus is airborne, it means people who don’t have Covid-19 patients in their vicinity are also prone to it now.” – Dr Arunesh Kumar, Sr Consultant and Head of Respiratory Medicine

Right from the cotton masks stitched at home, to the N95 and N99, double-layered, triple-layered and designer ones, the market has a wide range of masks on offer. “Maintaining social distancing norms and wearing a mask when stepping out remain the paramount guideline to avoid contracting the infection. As the new study suggests the virus is airborne, it means people who don’t have Covid-19 patients in their vicinity are also prone to it now,” says Dr Arunesh Kumar, a senior consultant and head of respiratory medicine at a Gurugram hospital.

A new study suggests that the virus is airborne, which means people who don’t have Covid-19 patients in their vicinity are also prone to it now.

How can one choose a right mask? “One should look at the degree of protection required. We do not need N95 mask for daily use as its breathability is very low. For office and travel, breathability should be good,” says Anuj Prasad, a Delhi-based designer of face armour, desmania aarmr. Masks should be skin-friendly, the outer layer should have a water-resistant fabric. The inner layer should be water-absorbent and the middle layer should act as a filter.

PPE Kits

There are multiple options available in PPE kits. “When it comes to gloves and overall PPE kits, people prefer only surgical products that can be disposed of after a single use,” says Delhi-based Mandeep Arora, MD of Ubon, a manufacturer of PPE kits, masks, gloves, sanitisers and other safety gear.

Rajat Meena, a resident of Dwarka who bought a PPE kit recently, says, “I’m associated with a third-party delivery system, and there are times when we have to travel long distances, so I prefer to wear PPE kits, they are use-and-throw ones. It’s better to be safe than sorry.

Face Shields

Is it better to use a face shield than using a mask? “A face shield covers the entire face, including the nose, mouth and eyes. So this has extra protection as chances of touching exposed areas are minimal,” adds Prasad. The shields are generally transparent, washable and can be bought keeping the use in mind. For work, travel or leisure, shields which are compatible for the fight against germs, can be used. Medical professionals require shields with extra protection.

Sanitizers

In sanitisers, right from the alcohol-based variety to the ayurvedic and skin-friendly ones, the variety is endless. But, denizens must remember that cheap sanitisers can burn the skin, or cause allergic reactions. Arora informs, “Sometimes, long exposure to the fragrance of some sanitisers and disinfectants can result in nausea, etc. While buying sanitisers and disinfectants, one should look for the amount of alcohol in them. A safe sanitiser should consist of about 60% to 95% of alcohol in ethanol, propanol or isopropanol form. Also, it should be made according to the formula recommended by the World Health Organisation and certified by government testing labs.”

A two-member team of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) visited Bihar’s Muzaffarpur district to find a suitable location for setting up a 500-bed temporary Covid-19 hospital, an official said on Sunday.

The hospital, to be built on the lines of another facility set up by the DRDO in Delhi, will cater to coronavirus patients in north Bihar, he said.

As a tribute to soldiers who fought in the Kargil war, President Ram Nath Kovind on Sunday donated Rs 20 lakh to the Army hospital here to buy equipment that will help doctors and paramedics combat Covid-19 effectively.

The contribution from the president will be used to procure units of PAPR (powered air purifying respirator), which are state-of-the-art equipment to enable medical professionals breathe during surgeries and protect them from infection, an official communique said.

This will serve the larger cause of patients’ care and protection to those warriors who are fighting an invisible enemy, it said.

“As a tribute to soldiers who fought valiantly and made supreme sacrifice in the Kargil war, the President of India, Ram Nath Kovind, today presented a cheque of Rs 20 lakh to the Army Hospital (Research and Referral), Delhi, to buy equipment that will help doctors and paramedics to combat the Covid-19 pandemic effectively,” the statement said. Sunday was the 21st anniversary of India’s victory over Pakistan in the Kargil war. The day is observed as ‘Kargil Vijay Diwas’.

The president’s contribution to the Army hospital has been made possible due to an exercise to economise expenditure at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the communique said.

The president had earlier issued directions to reduce expenses by initiating a slew of measures. “As a sequel to this initiative, he had earlier deferred the proposal to buy a limousine which was to be used for ceremonial occasions,” the statement issued by the Rashtrapati Bhavan said.

In his role as the supreme commander of the armed forces, the president’s gesture will boost the morale of the frontline Covid warriors of the Army hospital, it said.

“It will go a long way in providing a safe, conducive environment to them so that they can perform to the best of their ability. It is also hoped that the gesture will inspire other people and organisations to economise expenditure and utilise the savings to aid and support our Covid warriors,” the statement said. The Army Hospital (Research and Referral) is the apex medical care centre for the armed forces of India.

Officiating commandant Major General Sarat Chandra Dash was also a participant in “OP VIJAY” for which he was awarded the Yudh Seva Medal, it said. On July 26, 1999, the Indian Army had announced the successful culmination of “Operation Vijay”, declaring victory over Pakistan after the nearly three-month-long battles in the icy heights of Kargil. The country lost more than 500 soldiers in the war.

“In the prevailing situation, its doctors, nurses and paramedical staff are tirelessly working round the clock and providing the highest quality of medical care at great risk to their own lives,” the Rashtrapati Bhavan said.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/president-donates-rs-20-lakh-to-army-hospital-to-buy-equipment-to-combat-covid-19/story-h2gqg7WW62Tv2YatjpiWPK.html,Covid,/Updated:Ghaziabad,Updated,Ghaziabad,2020-07-26 14:56:42+05:30,President donates Rs 20 lakh to Army hospital to buy equipment to combat Covid-19

Adding to the upward trend of increased recovery of Covid-19 cases in the national capital, 1,14,875 people have recovered, the health bulletin released by the government stated.

Over 3,000 people who have travelled to Delhi via Vande Bharat Mission and bubble flights have also been accommodated in Delhi’s dedicated COVID care centre.

In contrast with tests conducted in Delhi over the week, fewer tests were conducted on Sunday as 5,032 RTPCR/CBNAAT/TrueNat tests and 12,501 rapid antigen testing samples were studied. A total of 9,46,777 tests have been done so far in Delhi, the health bulletin stated.

Delhi recorded its first coronavirus case in March 2 this year, over a month after India recorded its first case on January 30 in Kerala.

Ten new areas have been added to Delhi’s containment zones list on Sunday, pushing the count of total restricted areas to 714.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who had claimed last week that Delhi has turned a corned in its fight against the virus, again took to Twitter on Sunday and said that the occupancy of hospital beds in cases of Covid-19 has come down sharply in the national capital in the last one month.

“Corona bed occupancy has come down sharply from 23 June to 26 July. Much lesser no of people are now falling ill. Most of those falling ill are getting treated at home. Therefore, v few people are now needing hospitalization,” Kejriwal tweeted on Sunday, attaching screenshots of Delhi Corona app.

The chief minister, on overcoming the first wave of coronavirus infections, had said that “in a sense we can say that we have overcome the difficult situation that we saw in the month of June but, we must be prepared if this reoccurs.”

Updated: Jul 26, 2020 14:28 IST

Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot has requested Governor Kalraj Mishra to start a session of the state assembly to discuss bills, including one on the coronavirus pandemic, without mentioning a floor test, reports said on Sunday.

Gehlot asked him to start a session of the state assembly from July 31, according to news agency ANI.

Rajasthan is facing a political crisis due to a rebellion by Sachin Pilot and a section of Congress legislators supporting the former deputy chief minister.

The Gehlot camp, which is confident of its numbers and feels a floor test may be its best bet to end the political crisis, has said the governor is delaying convening a session due to pressure from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government.

Mishra has denied the charge, saying he will follow constitutional norms to convene the House.

The governor had turned down the earlier proposal sent by the Congress government and said that it did not mention a date or a reason.

Congress functionaries aware of the developments said on Saturday that the Rajasthan government has addressed Mishra’s queries on the urgent need for holding a special session of the assembly.

Legislators supporting chief minister Gehlot had on Friday staged a five-hour demonstration at Raj Bhavan to push for their demand for a special sitting.

Gehlot had told MLAs at a Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meeting on Saturday that he was ready to knock at the doors of the President’s House and protest outside the Prime Minister’s residence in the national capital to defeat the BJP’s “conspiracy” to topple his government, according to the Congress functionaries who did not want to be named.

The BJP has denied the Congress’ allegations and said that an internal feud has triggered the current crisis. On his part, Pilot had said he has no plans of joining the BJP.

Gehlot has the support of 101 members, excluding Speaker CP Joshi. Pilot has the backing of 18 Congress MLAs and three Independents, taking his tally to 22.

The BJP and its ally Rashtriya Loktrantrik Party have 75 seats. Bhanwarlal Meghwal, one Congress MLA said to be close to Pilot, is indisposed.

If Pilot’s tally is added to that of the opposition alliance, it takes their number up to 97.

A three-member swing from the Gehlot camp to the Pilot camp or to the BJP could lead to the government falling in the event of a floor test.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gehlot-resends-proposal-for-assembly-session-to-governor-no-mention-of-floor-test/story-ZWojZo4esE44MFBzBQGtLO.html,Riot,/Updated:Ghaziabad,Updated,Ghaziabad,2020-07-26 13:50:33+05:30,"Gehlot resends proposal for assembly session to governor, no mention of floor test"

Prime Minister’s latest edition of his monthly radio address, Mann ki Baat, was dedicated to remembering the indelible sacrifice made by the Indian Army soldiers who lost their lives fighting the Kargil War. The prime minister dedicated his Sunday’s address to Kargil Vijay Diwas as the nation marked the 21st anniversary of the victory in the Kargil War on Sunday. He also lauded the selfless fight of ‘corona warriors’ against the Covid-19 pandemic.

The prime minister reiterated the importance of wearing masks and maintaining social distancing amid the Covid-19 pandemic and applauded the efforts of groups in various states including Bihar, Jharkhand and northeast to promote local products amid the pandemic.

He said this year’s Independence Day will be celebrated amid the pandemic and urged the youth to resolve to make India Atmanirbhar (self-reliant). The prime minister also expressed solidarity with those affected by floods across India.

Here are PM Modi’s top quotes from the 67th edition of Mann Ki Baat

• Today is Kargil Vijay Diwas. 21 years ago, on this day our Army won the Kargil war. India can never forget circumstances under which the war was fought. Pakistan undertook this misadventure with sinister plans to capture India’s land and to divert its ongoing internal conflicts.

• You can imagine, the enemy was perched high on the mountains while our forces were fighting them. But the high morale and true of our forces won against mountains.

• Today, the Covid-19 recovery rate in our country is better compared to other countries; the mortality rate in the context of corona in our country is much less as well, compared to most countries, of course, the loss of even one life is saddening, but India has also succeeded in saving the lives of millions of her people.

• At many places, Covid-19 is spreading fast. We need to be extra vigilant. We have to bear in mind that corona is as fatal today as it was in the beginning - that’s why we have to be cautious.

• Wearing a face mask, using a ‘gamchcha’ or a light towel to cover, two-yard distancing, frequently washing hands, avoiding spitting anywhere, taking full care of hygiene and sanitation- these are our weapons to protect us from corona.

• There are times when masks cause inconvenience, one feels like removing them from the face- especially during a conversation. When a mask is required the most, we tend to remove it. At such times, I urge you that whenever you feel your mask is bothersome and you want to remove it, spare a thought for those doctors, those nurses; think of our corona warriors.

• You will find them wearing masks for hours together, diligently working to save our lives- sometimes wearing masks for a span of eight to ten hours. Doesn’t that discomfort them? Just think about them... you too will feel that as citizens, we should not be negligent at all; nor let others be so.

• I urge the youth, the people of my country to take a pledge of freedom from the pandemic this Independence Day. Take a resolve for a self-reliant India, a resolve to learn and teach something new and a resolve to earnestly carry out our duties.

• The festival of Raksha Bandhan is approaching. I have seen that many people and organisations are running initiatives to celebrate the festival in a different manner. Many are linking it to ‘Vocal for Local’ which is a step in the right direction.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-pm-modi-s-mann-ki-baat-address-a-tribute-to-kargil-bravehearts-corona-warriors-top-quotes/story-Pzw8lm7uQdImaTPyHhVRyI.html,Covid,/Updated:Ghaziabad,Updated,Ghaziabad,2020-07-26 13:36:42+05:30,"In PM Modi’s Mann ki Baat address, a tribute to Kargil bravehearts, Corona warriors: Top quotes"

President Xi Jinping’s strategy to expand its territorial dispute with Bhutan to needle India appears to have brought the tiny kingdom nestled in the Himalayas closer to New Delhi. Thimphu, which had last found itself caught in the crossfire between India and China during the 2017 Doklam standoff appeared to have had second thoughts about its proximity to India vis-a-vis China, people familiar with the developments told Hindustan Times.

There was lately, an emerging view in Bhutan, wedged geographically between India and China, that the kingdom should perhaps balance its ties with its two neighbours so that Thimphu isn’t squeezed between the giants again. “It was never spelt out in black and white but this view was gaining ground over the last two-three years,” people in New Delhi and Thimphu said.

But there has been a change in Thimpu’s approach over the last one month after Beijing stunned Bhutan at the June meeting of the US-based multinational fund, Global Environment Facility, when Thimphu was seeking funds for the Sakteng wildlife sanctuary. The Chinese representative objected, claiming that there was a dispute between China and Bhutan over part of the sanctuary spread across 650 sq km.

The Chinese move to make new territorial claims in Bhutan has convinced Thimpu that it should not hang to any hopes that its northern neighbour, 250 times bigger, would be fair. That if it cedes any ground to appease Beijing, it would only end up fueling its territorial ambitions, the people mentioned above said.

Thimphu formally protested the China claim, issuing a demarche to the Chinese mission in Delhi. Bhutan and Beijing use their missions in Delhi to communicate. It also issued a rare statement earlier this month, underlining that disputes relating to the undemarcated border would be discussed at the next round of border talks.

Bhutan and China have held 24 rounds of talks since 1984 to settle their border issue, the last in 2016. Beijing has been pressuring Bhutan to accept a package deal for nearly 20 years that would let it take over Bhutanese territory of Doklam, Sinchulung, Dramana, and Shakhatoe spread across 269 sq km in the western sector. In exchange, China would give up its claim over Bhutan’s Pasamlung and Jakarlung valleys in the north.

China’s claim over the nature preserve spread across 650 sq km in eastern Bhutan’s Trashigang district almost doubles the area of the disputed territories between the two countries from the existing 764 sq km.

Bhutan is yet to decide on an Indian proposal to build a road through the sanctuary that would sharply reduce the 450 km long distance between Guwahati and Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh by one-third. New Delhi is expected to take up the proposal with Thimphu as part of India’s hard push to border infrastructure.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-tried-to-jab-india-with-a-new-claim-on-bhutan-why-it-has-boomeranged/story-rqplyG6gdbN7eOs3X1FInM.html,Riot,/Updated:Ghaziabad,Updated,Ghaziabad,2020-07-26 07:44:08+05:30,China tried to jab India with a new claim on Bhutan.

The Delhi government will soon launch a job portal to make job opportunities available to those who have lost employment due to the Covid-19 lockdown. The announcement was made by Delhi labour minister Gopal Rai.

He said that the portal will act as common platform for companies looking to hire and job seekers.

The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government will soon come out with a slew of reforms to revive the national capital’s economy, which has been adversely affected due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown, he said, adding that many migrant workers have moved out of Delhi and several people have lost their jobs due to the shutdown.

“We have managed to arrest the spread of Covid-19 in Delhi. Now there is a need to bring the city’s economy back on the fast track,” said the minister.

Rai’s announcement comes weeks after the Maharashtra government launched a similar portal. Mahajobs was launched by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on July 6. It aims at making local manpower and employment opportunities available to companies and workers respectively.

The portal will help in the recruitment of skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled employees.

According to the description available on the portal, it has been created to meet the manpower needs of the companies which have been facing the challenge of skill gap due to mass migration triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Earlier this month, the Delhi government had formed a 12-member expert committee to explore economic reform measures in order to help businesses recover from the impact of Covid-19.

The AAP government had also extended counselling service by its education department to all residents of Delhi. The department has been providing educational and psychological counselling services to students through its YUVA Helpline since 2006.

“In a bid to help citizens with mental health amid the Covid-19 pandemic which has limited people’s physical movement and caused several damages in the employment sector, the Delhi government has taken this decision,” the government said in a statement.

It further said that people who need support on educational/emotional/psychological/personal issues can call on toll-free numbers 1800116888 or 10580 to get assistance.

It also said that identities of these people will be kept confidential.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-delhi-govt-to-launch-job-portal-to-help-people-find-employment-opportunities/story-PtrP7KyvOwWmELaNotIeTP.html,Covid,/Updated:Ghaziabad,Updated,Ghaziabad,2020-07-26 13:42:19+05:30,Covid-19: Delhi govt to launch job portal to help people find employment opportunities

Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who has contracted Covid-19, said on Sunday there was no need to fear the coronavirus disease as he urged people showing symptoms to get themselves tested.

Chouhan, who had tweeted on Saturday that he had tested positive for the coronavirus disease, said if someone detects the symptoms, they should not hide.

“There is no need to be scared of corona. As soon as you show symptoms, immediately get yourself tested and start treatment without hiding them. It is possible to win against corona then,” Chouhan said in a video message in Hindi.

The chief minister, who has been admitted to the Chirayu Hospital in the state capital of Bhopal for treatment, said he was doing fine as he praised frontline workers in the fight against Covid-19.

“My dear people of the state, I am fine. The team of corona warriors is very dedicated. I salute all the corona warriors in the state who are risking their lives to save others,” he said.

The 61-year-old Chouhan said people must use the major weapons against the viral disease to ensure they do not contract Covid-19.

“The main weapons to fight against corona are mask and the distance of two yards. We must use these weapons and no one will contract corona,” he added.

The chief minister also posted his messages on Twitter, saying he was praying that everyone is careful and stays safe and healthy.

The much-awaited Financial Action Task Force (FATF) mutual evaluation of India’s anti-money laundering regime and legal measures framed to check financial crimes, scheduled for this year, has been postponed till early next year in view of the coronavirus pandemic, officials said.

They said the on-site review to be conducted by experts of the global body was scheduled to begin in September-October but the FATF secretariat in Paris has conveyed to India that the review is being tentatively pushed to January-February next year.

The FATF is a global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog that sets international standards to prevent illegal activities in the economic and financial channels of a country and its inter-connected linkages across the world.

It conducts “peer reviews of each member on an ongoing basis to assess levels of implementation of the FATF recommendations and provides an in-depth description and analysis of each country’s system for preventing criminal abuse of the financial system.” The review of India’s anti-money laundering and terrorist financing regime was scheduled for this year as part of a regular review cycle after 10 years. The last such review was done in June 2010, a senior officer in an anti-money laundering agency said.

The FATF, post this review, had said in 2013 that “India had made significant progress in addressing deficiencies identified in its mutual evaluation report and (the FATF) decided that the country should be removed from the regular follow-up process.” India has set up a joint working group comprising 22 central investigation, intelligence gathering and regulatory agencies to make presentations and brief the FATF experts, drawn from various countries, this time.

Some of the prominent agencies in this grouping supervised by the Department of Revenue under the finance ministry include the CBI, ED, Income Tax Department, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), Customs, market regulator SEBI, banking regulator RBI and insurance regulator IRDAI. The Union government had also deputed Rahul Navin, a 1993-batch Indian Revenue Service officer of the Income Tax Department, to work as an officer on special duty (OSD) with the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to take these processes forward.

Navin has authored a book, ‘Information Exchange and Tax Transparency: Tackling Global Tax Evasion and Avoidance’, and served in the international taxation wing of the tax department and worked closely with the OECD, another reputed global economic body.

The ED is the nodal agency to undertake investigations under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in the country. A senior Union finance ministry official said all preparations to brief the FATF reviewing group were nearing completion when the Covid-19 outbreak happened.

“We have been informed by the FATF that it has postponed the mutual evaluation of many jurisdictions scheduled this year including that of India due to the ongoing Covid-19 restrictions. It is expected that the new dates will be for early next year,” the officer told PTI.

The FATF too made a public declaration in this context.

“The gravity of the Covid-19 situation globally and the consequent Covid-19 related measures that countries have adopted, such as confinement and travel restrictions, are making it impossible for assessed jurisdictions and assessors alike to conduct on-site visits and in-person meetings. This situation has significantly impacted countries’ ability to actively participate in mutual evaluation and related follow-up processes.” “The FATF Plenary has therefore agreed to temporarily postpone all remaining FATF mutual evaluations and follow-up deadlines,” the FATF said.

It said India’s possible on-site period is “tbc (to be considered)”.

During the visit of FATF evaluators, the finance ministry officer said, India has prepared to present multiple dossiers of the action undertaken by it under the anti-money laundering law, criminal tax evasion probes and for strengthening the CFT (combating financing of terrorism) regime by the financial intelligence unit (FIU) and other agencies. The enactment of the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act in 2018, the anti-black money Act of 2015, amendments brought in the PMLA over the years, curbing tax evasion under indirect taxes by bringing in the GST (goods and services tax), new protocols to better regulate suspect transactions in banks and financial intermediaries and the 2016 demonetisation of two large currencies are part of the Indian presentation, another officer in a probe agency said. The high number of domestic and international attachment of assets under the PMLA and charge sheets filed by various probe agencies under criminal sections of the law against financial crimes and terror funding are also part of India’s presentation to the FATF review team, he said.

The new compliance regime brought in by the FIU for banks and other financial institutions to report suspect cash and counterfeit transactions will also be part of the presentation, he said.

The review takes about a year to finish and if all timelines are adhered to, the FATF will discuss the Indian legal system against financial crimes at its Plenary meeting in February, 2022 and subsequently issue a statement and recommendations about the country, the officer said.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fatf-review-of-india-s-anti-money-laundering-and-terror-financing-regime-pushed-to-2021-due-to-covid-19/story-HN26ZeE7UlSCCOmCSRmz9J.html,Murder,/Updated:Ghaziabad,Updated,Ghaziabad,2020-07-26 15:24:53+05:30,FATF review of India’s anti-money laundering and terror financing regime pushed to 2021 due to Covid-19

The high number of domestic and international attachment of assets under the PMLA and charge sheets filed by various probe agencies under criminal sections of the law against financial crimes and terror funding are also part of India’s presentation to the FATF review team, he said.

The new compliance regime brought in by the FIU for banks and other financial institutions to report suspect cash and counterfeit transactions will also be part of the presentation, he said.

As a tribute to soldiers who fought in the Kargil war, President Ram Nath Kovind on Sunday donated Rs 20 lakh to the Army hospital here to buy equipment that will help doctors and paramedics combat Covid-19 effectively.

The contribution from the president will be used to procure units of PAPR (powered air purifying respirator), which are state-of-the-art equipment to enable medical professionals breathe during surgeries and protect them from infection, an official communique said.

This will serve the larger cause of patients’ care and protection to those warriors who are fighting an invisible enemy, it said.

“As a tribute to soldiers who fought valiantly and made supreme sacrifice in the Kargil war, the President of India, Ram Nath Kovind, today presented a cheque of Rs 20 lakh to the Army Hospital (Research and Referral), Delhi, to buy equipment that will help doctors and paramedics to combat the Covid-19 pandemic effectively,” the statement said. Sunday was the 21st anniversary of India’s victory over Pakistan in the Kargil war. The day is observed as ‘Kargil Vijay Diwas’.

The president’s contribution to the Army hospital has been made possible due to an exercise to economise expenditure at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the communique said.

The president had earlier issued directions to reduce expenses by initiating a slew of measures. “As a sequel to this initiative, he had earlier deferred the proposal to buy a limousine which was to be used for ceremonial occasions,” the statement issued by the Rashtrapati Bhavan said.

In his role as the supreme commander of the armed forces, the president’s gesture will boost the morale of the frontline Covid warriors of the Army hospital, it said.

“It will go a long way in providing a safe, conducive environment to them so that they can perform to the best of their ability. It is also hoped that the gesture will inspire other people and organisations to economise expenditure and utilise the savings to aid and support our Covid warriors,” the statement said. The Army Hospital (Research and Referral) is the apex medical care centre for the armed forces of India.

Officiating commandant Major General Sarat Chandra Dash was also a participant in “OP VIJAY” for which he was awarded the Yudh Seva Medal, it said. On July 26, 1999, the Indian Army had announced the successful culmination of “Operation Vijay”, declaring victory over Pakistan after the nearly three-month-long battles in the icy heights of Kargil. The country lost more than 500 soldiers in the war.

“In the prevailing situation, its doctors, nurses and paramedical staff are tirelessly working round the clock and providing the highest quality of medical care at great risk to their own lives,” the Rashtrapati Bhavan said.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/president-donates-rs-20-lakh-to-army-hospital-to-buy-equipment-to-combat-covid-19/story-h2gqg7WW62Tv2YatjpiWPK.html,Covid,/Updated:Ghaziabad,Updated,Ghaziabad,2020-07-26 14:56:42+05:30,President donates Rs 20 lakh to Army hospital to buy equipment to combat Covid-19

The Kissing Booth 2

Director: Vince Marcello

Cast: Joey King, Jacob Elordi, Joel Courtney, Taylor Zakhar Perez

Lara Jean may have been able to resist the charms of a second hot boy in her life but Elle Evans may not be made of such stern stuff. The Kissing Booth 2 presents a similar dilemma to its nerdy American high schooler lead, as earlier this year’s To All The Boys: PS I Love You—falling for another unearthly cute guy when you already have an unearthly cute guy in your arms. However, The Kissing Booth 2 is not as stylish or even half as heartfelt, making it just a quarter as enjoyable.

Watch the trailer for The Kissing Booth 2:

Set in the fantastical, faraway land of Netflix high school romcoms where one regularly gets the option to choose between two perfect specimens of human males, The Kissing Booth 2 is unable to find a true calling, purpose or justification for a sequel. It sits at a bloated runtime of 130 minutes and to while it away, it employs any and every conflict possible. There’re jealous girlfriends, annoying best friends, lying boys, seduced girls, fear of the future, a dance competition, adultery, self doubt, the uncaring way of life, forbidden love, and the belief in the existence of soulmates. But much like that inedible broth, too many conflicts also spoil what could have been a slick high school comedy.

This time, Elle (Joey King) must navigate life through senior year at her sunny California school after her boyfriend Noah (Jacob Elordi) leaves for Harvard. They decide to give long distance relationship a chance, a promise that is not helped by the arrival of a dashing new admission at school, Marco (Taylor Zakhar Perez). With his curls, sweaty gym videos and guitar, he soon makes long distance celibacy a tough task for Elle, who is already turned into the doubting girlfriend, jealous of Noah’s gorgeous new friend at college, Chloe (Maisie Richardson).

Any other high school movie would have perhaps been content with so much on their plate but not this one. This love-quadrangle is only in addition to the conflict brewing between Elle, her best friend Lee (Joel Courtney) and his frankly frustrated girlfriend Rachel. While Elle and Lee’s friendship, their Dance Dance Revolution sessions and the easy, electric chemistry between Joey and Joel make for some of the best things about the film, Rachel is not so cool with Elle third-wheeling them all the time. If the break-ups and the proclamations of the core group were too much to keep track of, this only adds to the chaos.

Even with constant voice-overs about her feelings and learnings—Elle is writing her letters of applications to various colleges throughout the film—it still gets confusing to keep up with her many musings and motivations. The film is incredibly stretched. A scene in the beginning, about a ‘comedic’ disaster with the school announcement system, drags on for a torturous minute. There is very little humour about it and even less so when it plays out with that chaotic, Disney Channel energy.

The jealous girlfriend plot also takes multiple revisits to finally establish the excuse to dump the past and move on to a guitar-strumming, curly haired future. And frankly, Joey and Jacob’s negligible amount of scenes together—the secret, forbidden romance from the first part replaced by Skype calls and unread texts—makes it hard to root for ‘Elno’ anyway.

But The Kissing Booth 2 is not without its moments of genuine goodness. Taylor’s charming powers can be felt through your screens even as he woos Elle on the DDM machine or plays her a sweet song at the beach, talking about how he would treat her right. Their electric scenes make you second guess the validity of Elle and Noah’s long confessions of love and maybe, just this once, you’d have let the heroine break up with Colin Firth for Hugh Grant.

A third love story—about a boy finding the courage to come out to his school, confess his love for a genius dork—also brings sweet respite from Elle and her many troubles. The ending of the film, even though rushed, feels almost acceptable just for the sake of these two.

The Kissing Booth 2 ( Marcos Cruz/Netflix )

Joey is still a good fit for Elle. She can be convincingly excited about Halloween costumes and also heartbroken over a cheating boyfriend. Jacob, however, appeared to have checked out of that Zoom call a while ago.

With its bubblegum filters, school kids in convertibles on a sunny street and mediocre essays being deemed fit for a Harvard acceptance letter, there is much that separates The Kissing Booth 2 from reality. Which is why it is quite the right specimen of the high school romantic comedy section of Netflix.

50,31,"Gehlot resends proposal for assembly session to governor, no mention of floor test

india

Updated: Jul 26, 2020 14:28 IST

Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot has requested Governor Kalraj Mishra to start a session of the state assembly to discuss bills, including one on the coronavirus pandemic, without mentioning a floor test, reports said on Sunday.

Gehlot asked him to start a session of the state assembly from July 31, according to news agency ANI.

Rajasthan is facing a political crisis due to a rebellion by Sachin Pilot and a section of Congress legislators supporting the former deputy chief minister.

The Gehlot camp, which is confident of its numbers and feels a floor test may be its best bet to end the political crisis, has said the governor is delaying convening a session due to pressure from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government.

Mishra has denied the charge, saying he will follow constitutional norms to convene the House.

The governor had turned down the earlier proposal sent by the Congress government and said that it did not mention a date or a reason.

Congress functionaries aware of the developments said on Saturday that the Rajasthan government has addressed Mishra’s queries on the urgent need for holding a special session of the assembly.

Legislators supporting chief minister Gehlot had on Friday staged a five-hour demonstration at Raj Bhavan to push for their demand for a special sitting.

Gehlot had told MLAs at a Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meeting on Saturday that he was ready to knock at the doors of the President’s House and protest outside the Prime Minister’s residence in the national capital to defeat the BJP’s “conspiracy” to topple his government, according to the Congress functionaries who did not want to be named.

The BJP has denied the Congress’ allegations and said that an internal feud has triggered the current crisis. On his part, Pilot had said he has no plans of joining the BJP.

Gehlot has the support of 101 members, excluding Speaker CP Joshi. Pilot has the backing of 18 Congress MLAs and three Independents, taking his tally to 22.

The BJP and its ally Rashtriya Loktrantrik Party have 75 seats. Bhanwarlal Meghwal, one Congress MLA said to be close to Pilot, is indisposed.

If Pilot’s tally is added to that of the opposition alliance, it takes their number up to 97.

A three-member swing from the Gehlot camp to the Pilot camp or to the BJP could lead to the government falling in the event of a floor test.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gehlot-resends-proposal-for-assembly-session-to-governor-no-mention-of-floor-test/story-ZWojZo4esE44MFBzBQGtLO.html,Riot,/Updated:Ghaziabad,Updated,Ghaziabad,2020-07-26 13:50:33+05:30,"Gehlot resends proposal for assembly session to governor, no mention of floor test"

Prime Minister’s latest edition of his monthly radio address, Mann ki Baat, was dedicated to remembering the indelible sacrifice made by the Indian Army soldiers who lost their lives fighting the Kargil War. The prime minister dedicated his Sunday’s address to Kargil Vijay Diwas as the nation marked the 21st anniversary of the victory in the Kargil War on Sunday. He also lauded the selfless fight of ‘corona warriors’ against the Covid-19 pandemic.

The prime minister reiterated the importance of wearing masks and maintaining social distancing amid the Covid-19 pandemic and applauded the efforts of groups in various states including Bihar, Jharkhand and northeast to promote local products amid the pandemic.

He said this year’s Independence Day will be celebrated amid the pandemic and urged the youth to resolve to make India Atmanirbhar (self-reliant). The prime minister also expressed solidarity with those affected by floods across India.

Here are PM Modi’s top quotes from the 67th edition of Mann Ki Baat

• Today is Kargil Vijay Diwas. 21 years ago, on this day our Army won the Kargil war. India can never forget circumstances under which the war was fought. Pakistan undertook this misadventure with sinister plans to capture India’s land and to divert its ongoing internal conflicts.

• You can imagine, the enemy was perched high on the mountains while our forces were fighting them. But the high morale and true of our forces won against mountains.

• Today, the Covid-19 recovery rate in our country is better compared to other countries; the mortality rate in the context of corona in our country is much less as well, compared to most countries, of course, the loss of even one life is saddening, but India has also succeeded in saving the lives of millions of her people.

• At many places, Covid-19 is spreading fast. We need to be extra vigilant. We have to bear in mind that corona is as fatal today as it was in the beginning - that’s why we have to be cautious.

• Wearing a face mask, using a ‘gamchcha’ or a light towel to cover, two-yard distancing, frequently washing hands, avoiding spitting anywhere, taking full care of hygiene and sanitation- these are our weapons to protect us from corona.

• There are times when masks cause inconvenience, one feels like removing them from the face- especially during a conversation. When a mask is required the most, we tend to remove it. At such times, I urge you that whenever you feel your mask is bothersome and you want to remove it, spare a thought for those doctors, those nurses; think of our corona warriors.

• You will find them wearing masks for hours together, diligently working to save our lives- sometimes wearing masks for a span of eight to ten hours. Doesn’t that discomfort them? Just think about them... you too will feel that as citizens, we should not be negligent at all; nor let others be so.

• I urge the youth, the people of my country to take a pledge of freedom from the pandemic this Independence Day. Take a resolve for a self-reliant India, a resolve to learn and teach something new and a resolve to earnestly carry out our duties.

• The festival of Raksha Bandhan is approaching. I have seen that many people and organisations are running initiatives to celebrate the festival in a different manner. Many are linking it to ‘Vocal for Local’ which is a step in the right direction.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-pm-modi-s-mann-ki-baat-address-a-tribute-to-kargil-bravehearts-corona-warriors-top-quotes/story-Pzw8lm7uQdImaTPyHhVRyI.html,Covid,/Updated:Ghaziabad,Updated,Ghaziabad,2020-07-26 13:36:42+05:30,"In PM Modi’s Mann ki Baat address, a tribute to Kargil bravehearts, Corona warriors: Top quotes"

President Xi Jinping’s strategy to expand its territorial dispute with Bhutan to needle India appears to have brought the tiny kingdom nestled in the Himalayas closer to New Delhi. Thimphu, which had last found itself caught in the crossfire between India and China during the 2017 Doklam standoff appeared to have had second thoughts about its proximity to India vis-a-vis China, people familiar with the developments told Hindustan Times.

There was lately, an emerging view in Bhutan, wedged geographically between India and China, that the kingdom should perhaps balance its ties with its two neighbours so that Thimphu isn’t squeezed between the giants again. “It was never spelt out in black and white but this view was gaining ground over the last two-three years,” people in New Delhi and Thimphu said.

But there has been a change in Thimpu’s approach over the last one month after Beijing stunned Bhutan at the June meeting of the US-based multinational fund, Global Environment Facility, when Thimphu was seeking funds for the Sakteng wildlife sanctuary. The Chinese representative objected, claiming that there was a dispute between China and Bhutan over part of the sanctuary spread across 650 sq km.

The Chinese move to make new territorial claims in Bhutan has convinced Thimpu that it should not hang to any hopes that its northern neighbour, 250 times bigger, would be fair. That if it cedes any ground to appease Beijing, it would only end up fueling its territorial ambitions, the people mentioned above said.

Thimphu formally protested the China claim, issuing a demarche to the Chinese mission in Delhi. Bhutan and Beijing use their missions in Delhi to communicate. It also issued a rare statement earlier this month, underlining that disputes relating to the undemarcated border would be discussed at the next round of border talks.

Bhutan and China have held 24 rounds of talks since 1984 to settle their border issue, the last in 2016. Beijing has been pressuring Bhutan to accept a package deal for nearly 20 years that would let it take over Bhutanese territory of Doklam, Sinchulung, Dramana, and Shakhatoe spread across 269 sq km in the western sector. In exchange, China would give up its claim over Bhutan’s Pasamlung and Jakarlung valleys in the north.

China’s claim over the nature preserve spread across 650 sq km in eastern Bhutan’s Trashigang district almost doubles the area of the disputed territories between the two countries from the existing 764 sq km.

Bhutan is yet to decide on an Indian proposal to build a road through the sanctuary that would sharply reduce the 450 km long distance between Guwahati and Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh by one-third. New Delhi is expected to take up the proposal with Thimphu as part of India’s hard push to border infrastructure.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-tried-to-jab-india-with-a-new-claim-on-bhutan-why-it-has-boomeranged/story-rqplyG6gdbN7eOs3X1FInM.html,Riot,/Updated:Ghaziabad,Updated,Ghaziabad,2020-07-26 07:44:08+05:30,China tried to jab India with a new claim on Bhutan.

The Delhi government will soon launch a job portal to make job opportunities available to those who have lost employment due to the Covid-19 lockdown. The announcement was made by Delhi labour minister Gopal Rai.

He said that the portal will act as common platform for companies looking to hire and job seekers.

The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government will soon come out with a slew of reforms to revive the national capital’s economy, which has been adversely affected due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown, he said, adding that many migrant workers have moved out of Delhi and several people have lost their jobs due to the shutdown.

“We have managed to arrest the spread of Covid-19 in Delhi. Now there is a need to bring the city’s economy back on the fast track,” said the minister.

Rai’s announcement comes weeks after the Maharashtra government launched a similar portal. Mahajobs was launched by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on July 6. It aims at making local manpower and employment opportunities available to companies and workers respectively.

The portal will help in the recruitment of skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled employees.

According to the description available on the portal, it has been created to meet the manpower needs of the companies which have been facing the challenge of skill gap due to mass migration triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Earlier this month, the Delhi government had formed a 12-member expert committee to explore economic reform measures in order to help businesses recover from the impact of Covid-19.

The AAP government had also extended counselling service by its education department to all residents of Delhi. The department has been providing educational and psychological counselling services to students through its YUVA Helpline since 2006.

“In a bid to help citizens with mental health amid the Covid-19 pandemic which has limited people’s physical movement and caused several damages in the employment sector, the Delhi government has taken this decision,” the government said in a statement.

It further said that people who need support on educational/emotional/psychological/personal issues can call on toll-free numbers 1800116888 or 10580 to get assistance.

mumbai

Updated: Jul 26, 2020 14:28 IST

Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday challenged the opposition to pull his government down as the Maharashtra chief minister emphasised he was at the helm of the three-party coalition government in the state.

In the last of the two-part interview to the Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamana, Thackeray said the fate of his government was not in the hands of the opposition.

The chief minister, while speaking to Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut, also targeted the Centre’s ambitious Mumbai- Ahmedabad bullet train project to put his point across.

Replying to a question related to the opposition criticism that his government was a three-wheeled vehicle, in a reference to his alliance partners - the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress, Thackeray said his Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government represents the poor people.

“If it is the choice between a bullet train and a three-wheeler, I will choose the latter as it is the travelling mode of the poor people. It is a strong government and I am at the steering wheel with two other partners,” he said.

Thackeray, who will turn 60 on Monday, also pointed at the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government at the Centre to deflect the criticism.

“The ones who have been raising questions about our ‘three-wheeler’ should look at the government at the Centre. How many parties are there as coalition partners? When I attended the NDA meeting last time, there were 30-35 leaders representing ruling parties. It should be called a ‘train’ government then,” he added.

Thackeray said that there were no differences between the three parties even though there was a lack of continuous dialogue due to the outbreak of the Covid-19.

“Congress had some issues related to the matters on public policies. After our meeting, they have been solved. We have better coordination between us. I take guidance regularly from NCP chief Sharad Pawar Saheb and occasionally speak Soniaji Gandhi,” he said.

The Shiv Sena chief also took a dig at Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for its alleged attempt to topple the Congress government in Rajasthan. He said Operation Lotus would not reap any success in Maharashtra.

“It is strange that the use of money for political gain is not a crime and the opponents are targeted using central agencies. But this would not last for too long. They should also keep in mind that days keep passing by,” he said.

“They tried to topple the Rajasthan government perhaps because there is no pandemic spread in that state or in Madhya Pradesh. The leader of opposition [Devendra Fadnavis] criticised the Maharashtra government over the handling of Covid-19 during his Delhi visit, perhaps because the pandemic exists only in our state and not in Rajasthan or Madhya Pradesh,” he said.

The chief minister said it was not correct to say that the decision-making process regarding the coronavirus pandemic in the state is driven by the bureaucracy.

“Our handling of Covid-19 pandemic, especially in Dharavi, has been applauded at the international level. I was chosen as among the popular chief ministers. If the bureaucracy was at the driving seat, why was the government praised and was it done by the bureaucracy without any control from the government?” he asked.

“The government policies are after all implemented by the officers and the bureaucracy and is the duty of the government to stand firm by the efficient officers. I will firmly support such officers,” he added.

Thackeray said he has requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take a uniform decision over the policies related to China as India is faced with a border standoff with that country.

“Our policies related to China should not be deviating as they differ in case of Pakistan. During times of trouble, we boycott these countries and after a few days extend an olive branch before them. During one of our interactions, I requested Modiji to take a firm stand on China and decide finally on the trade with Chinese companies. We have put our memorandum of understanding with them (Chinese companies) on hold,” the CM said.

Thackeray said the decision to allow the bullet train between Mumbai and Ahmedabad will be taken on the basis of people’s mandate. He said he would want to a bullet train to run between Mumbai and Nagpur as it will prove more beneficial for the development of the state.

“My individual opinion or that of my party’s stand on the bullet train project could be different, but as a state, the government will take its decision at the appropriate time. Currently, it is on hold. The government decision will be based on the people’s mandate about the project and after discussing it with all the stakeholders,” he said.

Thackeray added that if the people of Maharashtra decide against the bullet train, he will cancel it.

The Shiv Sena leader also suggested a virtual bhoomi pujan ahead of the construction of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya to avoid the crowding at the site, saying it could lead to the spread of Sars-Cov-2, which causes the coronavirus disease.

He said lakhs of Hindus from all across the globe worship Lord Ram and would want to flock for the bhoomi pujan.

“Instead of putting their lives in danger, the laying of foundation stone could be done online,” he said.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/do-it-if-you-can-uddhav-thackeray-dares-opposition-to-topple-his-govt/story-xA7ZxfoUsL3TYnMniIxS1O.html,Murder,/Centre:Mumbai,Centre,Mumbai,2020-07-26 13:56:13+05:30,Do it if you can: Uddhav Thackeray dares opposition to topple his govt

Addressing the 67th edition of his monthly radio programme Mann Ki Baat, PM Modi hailed the declining Covid-19 fatality rate and increasing recovery rate and at the same time emphasised that the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) continues to be lethal.

“We have been able to save the lives of lakhs of people but the threat of coronavirus is not over yet. It is spreading fast in many areas and we need to remain vigilant,” he said.

PM Modi said people have to continue wearing masks, keep a distance of two yards, wash hands continuously, not spit anywhere and take full care of cleanliness as these are the weapons that can protect us against the coronavirus disease.

“At such a time, I would urge you that whenever you feel troubled because of the mask and feel like removing it, then, for a moment, remember those doctors, nurses and corona warriors,” he said.

“They keep wearing masks continuously for hours and are working to save everyone’s lives. They keep wearing the mask for eight to ten hours. Aren’t they troubled?” he asked.

59,6,"The story so far: Plaudits won by Kerala for stamping out the COVID-19 pandemic appeared premature when in early July, a superspreader event in the densely-populated coastal villages of Poonthura, Manikyavilakam and Puthenpally (on the outskirts of Thiruvananthapuram city) led to a spike in infections through local transmission. Very soon, the cluster grew over a fairly large population and similar clusters mushroomed in Chellanam and Aluva in Ernakulam. Daily cases of local transmission exceeded imported infections within a week. An alarming 81% of the cases reported on July 24 were through local spread of the virus. The total number of cases leapt from 6,166 on July 8 to 16,995 on July 24, with 9,371 active infections. There were 453 containment zones, triggering discussions about a potential Statewide shutdown, but the suggestion was put on hold almost unanimously at an all-party meeting chaired by Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan.

Was Kerala’s early success a fluke?

India’s first COVID-19 case was detected in Kerala on January 30, when a medical student from Wuhan in China tested positive in Thrissur. The State’s health apparatus had stayed alert with customised containment guidelines and protocols and the first wave ended with the recovery of all three imported cases. A middle-aged couple returning from Italy gave the surveillance team at the airport the slip, causing another bout of infections. More instances of quarantine violations came to the fore as the number of cases grew to 499, 33% of which was on account of local spread.

Data | COVID-19 resurges in Kerala as migrants return, testing rate drops

However, the State leveraged its epidemic management skills gleaned from two Nipah outbreaks, the ingenious technology-driven use of ‘contact-tracing’ using spatiotemporal data, social capital and decentralised governance to tether the daily figures to zero all over again in the first week of May. On May 4, just 16 patients (3.5% of the total cases) were under treatment in hospitals. Deft planning and execution and enthusiastic people’s participation ensured the success of the ‘break-the-chain’ of the coronavirus campaign, the community kitchen initiative to feed the needy, psycho-social counselling to alleviate stress and rationing of essentials. People lapped up the government’s socio-economic interventions during this period.

Spirits were still high and the government began to open up sectors on priority in a phased manner from mid-May with the twin aim of reviving economic activity and to ease the burden on the labour class, farmers and the self-employed.

Was the third wave entirely unexpected?

When the Centre was contemplating repatriation missions from abroad, the pandemic had straddled the continents. Kerala, which has a large population of overseas Indians, wanted tests to be conducted at the port of origin so that travellers who were suspected to have contracted the infection could be segregated and ferried separately. When that did not happen, passenger handling policy at Kerala’s airports was revised with the aim of multi-layer screening to isolate people with symptoms and shift them to designated COVID-19 hospitals, which were already up and running.

Also read | 70% of new Kerala cases due to local spread

The local bodies were tasked with readying institutional quarantine centres for the returnees, a policy which made way, in the wake of an influx of people starting from May 7, and with hiccups in the arrangement, to ‘paid quarantine’ for those who could afford it and home quarantine for all others except those with no home isolation facility. The State has so far received 6,03,199 people in the post-lockdown repatriation exercise. It became a vexing political question when the government insisted that everyone desirous of entering the State mandatorily register themselves on the COVID-19 Jagratha portal and get passes.

A prescient warning had been sounded by the experts’ panel advising the State on corona containment strategy; the planning wing had presented projections and the State braced itself for a surge in cases. In fact, extreme shortage of testing material — swab, medium and kit — in May-end and early June determined the way the State modulated its strategy. “We chose to test only those likely to have been infected and used the kits sparingly. Meanwhile, sentinel surveillance among the high-risk sections like health workers and the police was kick-started to detect social spread,” said a top official.

A bouquet of tests — RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction), antigen, antibody, TrueNat, CBNAAT (cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test) and the like — was introduced to monitor trends even as a decision was taken to test everyone with influenza-like illness (ILI).

What went wrong?

As more relaxations kicked in and with the ‘success stories’ inducing a degree of complacency and false sense of safety in people, several chose to throw caution to the winds, violating social distancing and quarantine norms with alacrity. Unannounced entry of people through the porous borders of Thiruvananthapuram, Wayanad and Kannur made tracking difficult. Ceremonies such as marriages, with hundreds in attendance, were held against stipulations leading to spread of the infection.

By the end of June, sentinel surveillance indicated a wide cluster of infections in Ponnani taluk in Malappuram following which a lockdown, of the kind earlier successfully experimented with in Kasaragod, was clamped in the taluk. Meanwhile, infections with no known source of origin emerged, prompting the government to admit community transmission in the coastal pockets of Thiruvananthapuram.

Misleading campaigns and the fear of another imminent lockdown upsetting their livelihoods turned the people restive in critical containment zones such as Poonthura until they were reassured and the government announced relief measures. That a good number of the new patients were asymptomatic required the health officials to convince them that they were indeed sick and could infect others.

How serious is the situation?

Kerala’s vulnerability to the pandemic is compounded by its ageing but active population, a high degree of comorbidities in its people, and population density. Despite spiralling cases of community transmission, it has been able to maintain a cumulative test positivity rate of 2.6%. Says Rijo M. John, health economist, “But the cause for concern is the current positivity rate of 4.6%, which although much better than the national average of 11.7%, calls for doubling the rate of testing. It’s also ominous that cases are now doubling in 10 to 11 days whereas nationally it’s 18 to 20 days. That apart, case fatality at 0.32% is among the best.”

The State has been able to augment its testing by adding over 80 testing centres, with 25 RT-PCR stations. The rate of testing has steadily increased through July to cross 25,000 in a 24-hour cycle on July 24. The Kerala Medical Services Corporation has stockpiled adequate number of testing material for 30 days, and “the tests will be further ramped up in containment zones”, according to Dr. Mohammed Asheel, part of the State’s COVID-19 taskforce.

A doctor spearheading a major component of the battle against COVID-19 said the public health-care staff in Kerala are on the verge of exhaustion, having been on their toes since January. “There’s definitely a shortage of skilled human resources on the medical and non-medical fronts and this issue was flagged a few months ago, with the government making stand-in arrangements.” A COVID Brigade comprising trained medical professionals, skilled citizens and volunteers will be pressed into service at the COVID First-line Treatment Centres (CFLTCs) being set up by the local bodies.

“A total of 69,800 beds are getting ready at CFLTCs by the third week of July for treatment of asymptomatic patients,” Dr. Asheel said. The Chief Minister said a pool of 30,000 employees to man the CFLTCs have been selected and assigned to respective districts. “An additional 50,000 have been identified.”

Have the tables turned in favour of COVID-19?

The Kerala government still believes it has a fighting chance. “The immediate aim is to prevent deaths,” says a senior official, “and to ensure that the health system doesn’t breach its capacity threshold”. While the CFTLCs, which have already begun functioning, will ease the burden on the tertiary COVID hospitals, the State could consider asking asymptomatic patients, about 60% of the total, to stay at home, with some mechanism to monitor them in case the daily infection tally crosses 2,000, which is not unlikely by early-August. Over the past few months, the State has added more ventilators and ICUs in the public sector, but it must be noted that 60% of the State’s major health-care facilities are in the private sector. The government has held talks with some 1,129 of them about pricing and some 200 of them would be making their services available at the CFLTCs, says the Chief Minister.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/the-hindu-explains-why-have-covid-19-cases-surged-in-kerala/article32192847.ece,Covid,/Centre:Mumbai,Centre,Mumbai,,The Hindu Explains | Why have COVID-19 cases surged in Kerala?
60,8,"Amid a serious face-off with the Governor, the Congress government in Rajasthan on Saturday deliberated on a fresh proposal to convene a session of the State Assembly next week to enable Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot to prove his majority on the floor of the House. Governor Kalraj Mishra had on Friday refused to give immediate approval to a similar proposal.

A State Cabinet meeting, presided over by Mr. Gehlot, decided that the government would make a fresh submission to the Governor for calling the Assembly session, while responding to his questions raised over the original proposal.

News Analysis | Governor should strictly abide by advice of Cabinet to summon House: Supreme Court

In fresh communication to the Raj Bhavan, the Rajasthan cabinet conveyed that the Governor has no discretion in the matter and has to follow the advice of the Cabinet, The Hindu has learnt.

Citing previous Supreme Court rulings on the matter, the Gehlot cabinet is believed to have said the Government can neither question the period of convening an Assembly session, fix the procedures for the conduct of the session nor can it the agenda.

“The Cabinet met at 4 p.m. again and conveyed these points to the Raj Bhavan. We will wait for his response as we don’t want to escalate things,” a senior Congress leader said.

Mr Gehlot along with the MLAs supporting him had staged a five-hour-long sit-in on the lawns of Raj Bhavan here on Friday.

Rajasthan political crisis | Futile for people to expect safety if CM makes Governor ‘feel unsafe’: Shekhawat

While accusing the Governor of stalling a decision on summoning the House session under “pressure from above”, Mr. Gehlot had said the people from the entire State could lay siege to Raj Bhavan. The Chief Minister wants to prove his majority with the hope to end the political uncertainty created after the rebellion of Sachin Pilot, who has since been sacked as the Deputy CM.

A 15-member delegation of the Opposition BJP met the Governor on Saturday evening and demanded action to control the “anarchy” in the State and accused the Congress government of threatening constitutional institutions and violating the COVID-19 advisory on social distancing in the protests and demonstrations.

BJP State president Satish Poonia said the Congress leaders were making false accusations against others for their “internal crisis”, while Mr. Gehlot's statement on surrounding Raj Bhavan was a criminal act under Section 124 (assaulting President/Governor with intent to compel or restrain the exercise of any lawful power) of Indian Penal Code.

Earlier in the day, Mr. Gehlot told the MLAs at a Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meeting here that he would go to Rahstrapati Bhavan in New Delhi, if needed, to make sure that the “BJP's conspiracy” to topple his government did not succeed. “If we have to picket Rashtrapati Bhavan or even the Prime Minister's residence, we will do that,” he said.

As the legislators raised their hands in support, Mr. Gehlot asked them to maintain solidarity and stay strong, while indicating that they may have to stay in the hotel on the outskirts of Jaipur for 21 more days to complete the time of advance notice for convening a new session of the Assembly.

“The majority is with us,” Mr. Gehlot affirmed.

The Governor had earlier stated that the note containing the request forwarded by the government neither explained the urgency nor did it mention the agenda for the session.

The Governor sought a clarification on six issues and asked why the session should be convened for a floor test when the government itself was claiming that it had full majority in the House. “No justification has been given for calling the session at such a short notice,” he said.

The Congress workers staged demonstrations at district headquarters across the State on Saturday to protest against the BJP's alleged role in the political turmoil and to press for an Assembly session. The party workers took out a rally in Kota and staged a dharna in Jodhpur, while accusing the BJP of destroying the democratic norms.

61,9,"A district court in Gurugram has summoned Alibaba and its founder Jack Ma in a case in which a former employee in India says he was wrongfully fired after objecting to what he saw as censorship and fake news on company apps, documents seen by Reuters showed.

The case comes weeks after India cited security concerns in banning Alibaba's UC News, UC Browser and 57 other Chinese apps. Following the ban, which China has criticized, India sought written answers from all affected companies, including whether they censored content or acted for any foreign government.

In court filings dated July 20, the former employee of Alibaba's UC Web, Pushpandra Singh Parmar, alleges the company used to censor content seen as unfavourable to China and its apps UC Browser and UC News showcased false news “to cause social and political turmoil”.

Parmar, who worked as an associate director at the UC Web office in Gurugram until October 2017 and is seeking $268,000 in damages, referred Reuters queries to his lawyer, Atul Ahlawat, who declined to comment saying the matter was sub judice.

Also read: The Hindu Explains | What will be the impact of Chinese apps ban?

‘Sensitive words list’

In more than 200 pages of court filings, reviewed by Reuters, former employee Parmar included clippings of some posts showcased on the UC News app that he alleged were false. One post from 2017 was headlined in Hindi: “2,000-rupee notes to be banned from midnight today”. Another headline of a 2018 post said: “Just now: War broke out between India and Pakistan” and contained description of firing across the disputed border between the countries. Reuters could not independently verify the veracity of the claims in the court filing. India did not ban its 2,000-rupee currency note and no war occurred between India and Pakistan in 2018.

The lawsuit also contains a “sensitive words list” with key words in Hindi and English like “India-China border” and “Sino-India war” that the court filing alleges were used by UC Web to censor content on its platforms in India. “In order to control any news related content to be published against China was automatically/manually rejected by an audit system evolved for this purpose,” the filing said.

Civil Judge Sonia Sheokand has issued summons for Alibaba, Jack Ma and about a dozen individuals or company units, asking them to appear in court or through a lawyer on July 29, court documents showed. The judge has also sought written responses from the company and its executives within 30 days, according to the summons.

UC India said in a statement it had been “unwavering in its commitment to the India market and the welfare of its local employees, and its policies are in compliance with local laws. We are unable to comment on ongoing litigation”. Alibaba representatives did not respond to requests for comment from the Chinese company or on behalf of Jack Ma.
