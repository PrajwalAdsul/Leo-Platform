NEW DELHI: Moving swiftly towards taking the Delhi riots cases to their logical conclusion, Delhi Police has filed 79 chargesheets against 410 people for offences ranging from murders and arson to assembling unlawfully.Delhi Police spokesperson, Mandeep Singh Randhawa, said that out of these, the Crime Branch had arrested 104 people and the local police 306.Police claim that the murders were either due to instigation by a group of people or in retaliation to the violence that took place between December 24 and 26. They are also probing a conspiracy that was allegedly hatched through WhatsApp groups that were formed during or before the riots.The role of activist groups, such as India against Hate and Pinjra Tod, is also under the scanner. Names of Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam and Khalid Saifi figured during the interrogation of the perpetrators of the riot, claim police.According to police, the probe had found that the violence at Jamia Millia Islamia on December 13 last year was the beginning of a conspiracy that later turned the anti-CAA protests into violent clashes with the cops. The three months long protest at Shaheen Bagh was also a part of it, sources said.“In all these cases, the same group of people was found to be leading the protesters. They would block the road and cause inconvenience to public before getting into clashes with the cops to draw attention,” said a police officer.“During the interrogation of suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain and Rajdhani Public School owner Farooq Faisal, who have been charged with leading and instigating the rioters, it was found that the purpose of the riots was to embarrass the government during the US President Donald Trump’s visit to India,” sources added.“For the same reason, the members of the activist groups had led the women protesting at the roadside in Jafrabad and Chand Bagh to block the Jafrabad main road and Road Number 66.”Police claim to have recovered several WhatsApp chats in which people opposing the move to block roads were termed as traitors by the protesters. Police have also come across other WhatsApp groups that were formed to avenge the loss of life and property."

HYDERABAD: Upset over his wife testing positive for coronavirus , a 26-year-old painter set ablaze three vehicles while under the influence of alcohol at Bapunagar in Langar Houz on Tuesday night. Police booked him for arson and sent him for quarantine along with two of his friends.Last Saturday, the painter’s wife went to King Koti hospital after experiencing coronavirus symptoms. While her husband was also tested, the hospital sent him home. On Tuesday, her results came back positive and she was sent to Gandhi Hospital. Upset over this, he started consuming alcohol with his two friends and set the vehicles ablaze. “We have registered a case for arson.

The governor took cognizance of the allegation and asked the state government to weed out “corruption” in the public distribution system.Deprived PDS beneficiaries allegedly lit a fire using kerosene in front of a dealer’s house-cum-shop at Punashi under Shimulia gram panchayat in Salar. A large contingent of cops rushed to the spot and quelled the protest. Later, police also detained accused PDS dealer Halim Seikh Sarkar.People at Krishnapur in Lalgola complained that ration dealer Kayem Sheikh and his henchmen pelted stones and bricks from the rooftop, targeting beneficiaries, when he was accused of distributing essentials of substandard quality. Five reportedly sustained head injuries. Kayem dubbed it a conspiracy.At Fatepur, also in Lalgola, residents organized an agitation against PDS dealer Rabiul Islam for allegedly distributing adulterated rice. It is learnt additional SP Tanmoy Sarkar had to rush to three spots in Lalbag to pacify protesters.The dealers told police they were not receiving stocks to last a month, as announced by the chief minister, while customers were pressuring them for distribution of the same.In all the incidents, preliminary police reports suggest the opposition’s role in “instigating beneficiaries”. However, in Ward 20 of Trinamool-run Jangipur Municipality, the party faction opposing the civic chairman organized an ag-itation against dealer Rahamat Sheikh. It is led by the local TMC councillor.State food minister Jyotipriya Mullick blamed BJP and Congress for Saturday’s violence. “As many as 63,69,406 people have received ration. Some people (owing allegiance to opposition parties) targeted ration shops in Murshidabad even before they opened. Nevertheless, as many as 271 ration dealers have been taken to task,” he said.Mullick maintained that although the PM had announced free ration on March 25, the state was yet to get its entire rice quota.Congress leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Chowdhury, on the other hand, urged beneficiaries to check if they were getting rice in adequate quantity and of good quality. “People are supposed to get the Swarna variety of rice. They are instead receiving a substandard variety. The public distribution system in Bengal has become corrupt. If leaders of the ruling party are given a free hand to collect money from dealers, why won’t beneficiaries agitate amid lockdown?” the Behrampore MP said."

Lucknow: The district administration announced on Thursday that they would auction two sealed shops on July 16 to recover damages incurred during the anti-CAA protests in Hasanganj area on December 19. The shops were sealed on June 30 by the administration.

The administration also sealed another shop in Khurramnagar, belonging to Mohammad Nafees, who has been accused of rioting and damaging public property worth Rs 64 lakh at Parivartan Chowk.

“It is an ironsmith’s shop located in Khurramnagar and was sealed after the owner failed to pay for the damages of Rs 64 lakh,” said tehsildar Shambhu Saran. He added that the order to pay for recovery of damages was issued by ADM (east) KP Singh to 28 people on February 19.

He said that if the people whose properties are being sealed pay up the amount, their properties will be opened and auction proceedings will be halted.

The two shops that would be auctioned on July 16 include a garment store called NY Fashion Centre and a scrap dealer shop in the Hasanganj police station area. They were sealed on Tuesday.

Scrap dealer Mahenoor Chaudhary and the garment shop’s assistant store manager Dharamvir Singh are among the 13 whom ADM (trans-Gomti) Vishwa Bhushan Mishra had ordered to pay Rs 21.76 lakh within 30 days for the destruction of properties in Hasanganj.

Though the SC adjourned hearing on Sahrjeel's petition seeking consolidation of all FIRs, which made his alleged speech to cutoff Assam from India with five lakh persons , in all five states as states of Assam, Manipur and Arunchal were granted time to put in their responses, the Yogi Adityanath government said the accused person's speech at Aligarh Muslim University on january 16 during an anti-CAA protest had distinct local effect and hence different from the offences that could have been committed in other states as those FIRs showed.

The state government said ""subsequent to the January 16 hate speech at AMU and it becoming viral on social media platforms, there have been large scale incidents of stone pelting, arson and firing in the Aligarh district.""

""On January 23, around 150-200 protesters, including AMU students, blocked the road and raised slogans of hatred. On January 31, more than 500 persons congregated, including AMU students, for an anti-CAA demonstration creating a tense situation. On February 23, more than 500-600 unknown persons pelted stones, looted donation boxes at temples, scuffled with temple priests, leading to conflict and tension,"" the state said in its affidavit.

""Again on February 23, more than one thousand persons in a pre-planned manner forcibly entered Kotwali Upkot and created a riotous situation by firing from illegal firearms. On February 24, a congregation raised hatred slogans and pelted stones at police and fired upon them with illegal weapons injuring several policemen and damaging public property,"" it said.

The UP government said consolidation of Aligarh FIR with the FIRs lodged at Delhi and other states would be fatal to the investigation into the fall out of the Sharjeel's hate speech at Aligarh and its link with subsequent events that vitiated the communal harmony and created hatred between communities.

HYDERABAD: A fortnight after Molotov cocktails (bottles filled with flammable liquid and with a means of ignition) were hurled into a place of worship in Old City, two youths were arrested on Monday night. According to police, the accused duo had taken part in CAA/NRC protests, damaged an ATM centre and an RTC bus before targeting the place of worship.

The secretary of a worship place in Madannapet had lodged a complaint with police on March 14, alleging that some unidentified persons had hurled a petrol bomb into the worship place premises. “Broken pieces of the bottle were found in front of the worship place’s door at 4.30 am when one of the workers went there to open it. When the premises was searched, two more petrol bombs were found atop the worship place,” the complainant said.

Taskforce Additional DCP G Chakravarthi said during the interrogation, the duo confessed that during protests against CAA and NRC, they had resorted to acts of arson by setting fire to a private bank

The clash spills over outside campus

The ransacked Arts Faculty Students’ Union room

KOLKATA: Anarchy took over the Jadavpur University campus on Thursday evening as around 200 supporters of ABVP stormed the premises wearing bike helmets, armed with sticks and bottles. They ransacked the Arts union room near gate No. 4, the ground-floor corridor of the UG Arts building, set fire to at least six cycles and blocked the road outside the university for over an hour.The rampage began around 7pm and continued for over an hour. The group dispersed only after they had confirmation from their own leaders that central minister Babul Supriyo and governor Jagdeep Dhankhar had left the campus through another gate. Members of Durga Vahini, the women’s wing of Vishwa Hindu Parishad, also joined in the mayhem.When the marauding crowd finally left the campus around 8.15pm, it left behind bonfires that the fire brigade had to douse. ABVP was painted all over a union room and all the furniture smashed. At least one student and an amateur photographer suffered head injuries.Tea stalls outside the university were also set on fire. Pedestrians who had to walk the distance after traffic movement was stalled on Raja SC Mullick Road ran helter-skelter after being chased by ABVP supporters. “I was taking photographs of the protest when a group of ABVP supporters attacked me and snatched my camera. They hit me on the head with a stick. I ran into the university, where students gave me some first aid and later rushed me to hospital,” said Subhasis Das, a resident of Mukundapur, an amateur documentary filmmaker.Homemaker Sarmishtha Das had to scamper past the campus clutching her 14-year-old daughter in school uniform. “We had stopped to see what had happened, when a group of youths set fire to a cycle and began chasing everyone around, brandishing sticks. It was scary,” said the Baghajatin resident.University students said almost all men who were behind the attack were outsiders and had entered the campus to cause trouble. “Since afternoon, we had been organising a peaceful protest against BJP leader Babul Supriyo on our campus. Ours was an organised political programme but at no point did the protest turn violent. But look at what ABVP has done. They have brought in people from outside and vandalised our campus and spread panic outside,” said Roumya Chandra, a second-year postgraduate student of international relations.ABVP supporters said they had to call in reinforcements as there were only 50 of them on campus when hundreds of students gheraoed the minister, who was invited by ABVP to a freshers’ programme. “Since the authorities were not willing to call police and protesters were not even willing to listen to the appeals of the governor and gheraoed him on campus with the minister, we had to call our members from other colleges. That was the only way we had to get the guests out of the campus safely,” said Suranjan Sarkar, an ABVP leader and a first-year postgraduate student of mass communication.On why they had resorted to such violence, another ABVP leader, who is not a student at the university, said: “Any action will have consequences. SFI and TMC supporters had been assaulting our supporters since the afternoon and even molested one of our senior leaders. How long could we tolerate such things,” said Deep Biswas, a senior ABVP leader.The vandalism left JU students and teachers in shock. Samantak Das, professor of comparative literature, stood in disbelief seeing cops guarding JU’s main gate, with ABVP supporters setting fire to cycles of guards and students. His motorbike, too, was damaged. Nandini Mukherjee, a computer science and engineering professor, said: “I have never witnessed violence like this on campus. This is not the Jadavpur University I have known for long. I am scared for the students.”A police officer sent to the spot pleaded helplessness. “We cannot take any action on the campus unless we are asked by the authorities. When the protesters blocked the road outside, we tried to pacify them and did our best to limit the trouble to one area,” said a senior Kolkata Police officer."

Ujjain: A major fire broke out in the record room of Vikramaditya administrative block of Ujjain destroying important documents in the early hours of Wednesday.

The fire started on the second floor of the block at Kothi Palace at around 1 am and soon spread across the room filled with a huge stock of paper, sub-divisional magistrate RP Tiwari said.

“Old records of the divisional commissioner’s office were destroyed in the fire. The cause of the fire is not known, but chances of arson can’t be ruled out. Police are investigating the matter,” he said.

The first information of the fire was received by the police control room, following which the fire brigade sprung into action. The fire was doused after nearly four hours of toil.

“Six water tankers made 10 trips to the site and used 50,000 l water to douse the flames,” fire officer Ajay Singh Rajput told TOI adding that most of the files stored in the record room were lost – both in the fire and water used to douse it.

Sources said the documents were of four decades from 1960 and contained information about revenue related matters.

The Kothi Palace, where the administrative block is situated, is a 125-year-old building. The record room was kept locked. Firefighters found that the doors were completely destroyed and the locks were broken, indicating forced entry.

ASP Rupesh Dwivedi said Madhav Nagar police station has registered a case of fire. “We are also exploring the arson angle. A forensic team was on the spot to probe the matter,” he said.

Shivraj Singh Chouhan

BHOPAL: BJP vice-president Shivraj Singh Chouhan sparked controversy on Tuesday by alleging that 10 Janpath — the residence of Congress president Sonia Gandhi — is the “centre of violence and arson in the country”. Congress reacted by saying that Chouhan has been sidelined in BJP and is trying to be in news by making bizarre statements.

“Congress has been involved in the biggest mob lynching. After the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1984, Congress pushed the entire country into violence by saying that ‘when a big tree falls, the earth shakes’. Questions are still being raised on Congress’s involvement in mob lynching. Now, the party is trying to push the country into a spiral of violence in the name of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and 10 Janpath is its centre,” Chouhan told mediapersons in Ludhiana.

Chouhan, Madhya Pradesh’s CM for three terms, had triggered a major controversy in August last year when he called former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru a “criminal”. Chouhan had attacked Sonia Gandhi recently, asking why she did not say a word in Parliament during the debate on Citizenship Amendment Bill, but staged protests after it became a law.

Justifying the implementation of CAA, Chouhan said that during Partition, Hindus, Sikhs and other minorities living in Pakistan had suffered severe torture. “Punjab suffered the most. Minorities in Pakistan are still suffering torture and people are not safe. They are living in fear,” said Chouhan.

“The incident of stone pelting in Nankana Sahab is unfortunate. Congress is misleading the public to instigate violence. I want to ask Sonia ji, Punjab CM Amrinder Singh ji and MP CM Kamal Nath ji, what is wrong with CAA? What are they opposing? They should come clear on whether they do not want Hindus, Sikhs and other minorities, who have lost their lives in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, to be given Indian citizenship? They should make it clear if they want these Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists and Parsis to be sent back to Pakistan to die,” said Chouhan.

The BJP leader questioned Congress’s “silence” on the attack on the Nankana Sahab gurdwara in Pakistan. “I want to ask why Sonia ji and Rahul ji took 15 hours to condemn the attack on Nankana Sahab? Leaders from Punjab, who talk loud, did not react on the attack. Is their friendship with Imran so strong that they do not think of their own country? This is Congress character and I condemn this,” said Chouhan.

The former CM accused Rahul and Priyanka of creating misconception in the country on CAA. “But we will not let them succeed. Our leaders, including Prime Minister Modi and BJP national president Amit Shah and acting president JP Nadda are touring the country to make people aware of citizenship law,” he said.

The Congress reacted strongly to Chouhan’s allegation. “Chouhan has turned irrelevant since he lost power. He has been sidelined in his own party and wants to remain in news through bizarre statements,” said Congress state media coordinator Narendra Singh Saluja. “Chouhan has been shunted out of active politics. He should clarify who was held with bombs and explosives. He should also identify who were charged with anti-national activities for being involved in explosions.”

KOLKATA: Trouble again erupted at the “battle-ravaged” Dum Dum Central Correctional Home on Sunday, when some inmates reportedly tried to attack the women’s ward, took to arson and allegedly manhandled the guards, prompting police to resort to lathi-charge. A day earlier, inmates went on the rampage, set fire to jail property, fought pitched battles with police and attempted to scale over the walls, leading cops to open fire in which one prisoner was killed; at least 28 prisoners, jail employees and cops were injured on Saturday.Police on Sunday morning recovered two firearms and hammers in cells. “It seems to be a pre-planned attack or how could they have access to weapons on the premises,” said state correctional home minister Ujjwal Biswas . CID has started a probe into the incident.On Saturday, trouble broke out a little after 4pm, when the inmates were being sent back to their cells from the premises. Even as the new ADG (correctional services) Piyush Pandey tried to reason with them, the inmates reportedly launched a destruction frenzy, with one group setting a gas cylinder on fire. Before the situation could spiral out of control, police chased the group inside the cells. Another section of inmates reached the women’s ward, where the woman guards stopped them. But the male prisoners allegedly manhandled the women guards. Reinforcement of police and para-military forces ook nearly two hours to bring the situation under control.The reasons for the trouble were the same as that on Saturday: most prisoners and undertrials were upset with the fact that the prison authorities on Friday suspended their weekly interviews with their family members till March 31 to minimise the spread of the novel coronavirus . Another section of inmates demanded parole, as the government had proposed a 15-day “break” to around lifers, reportedly to decongest the correctional home.“We have identified those who have been creating trouble and provoking others. They apparently even threatened some male inmates, who had refused to join in the agitation on Saturday. To garner more support, the trouble-makers on Sunday tried to intimidate the female inmates into joining the agitation,” Biswas said.A CID team that reached the correctional home on Sunday is looking at the possibility of a lacunae in assessing and controlling a supposed emnity between the undertrials and convicts. The agency is collecting Saturday’s video footage circulated on social media."

NEW DELHI: Army chief Gen Bipin Rawat waded into a controversy on Thursday with his remarks that leadership is not about leading people — including students in universities and colleges — in the wrong direction, inviting criticism from the opposition that he had overstepped his limits as a serving officer.“Leaders are not those who lead people in inappropriate directions, as we are witnessing in a large number of university and college students, the way they are leading masses of crowds to carry out arson and violence in our cities and towns. This is not leadership,” Gen Rawat said.He is tipped to take over as the country’s first-ever chief of defence staff after completing his three-year tenure as Army chief on December 31. A senior officer at Army Headquarters later clarified that Gen Rawat had basically talked about “leadership qualities” in his speech.“There were no political statements. He did not mention either the CAA or the National Register of Citizens. He just expressed his worry about the law-and order situation, which impacts overall national security,” he added.But the reference — though Gen Rawat did not mention the Citizenship (Amendment) Act — was read in the context of the anti-CAA protests and violence in campuses like Jamia and AMU and saw CPM demanding that the general apologise for his “indiscretion” which had “adverse ramifications for the constitutional arrangement in the country”.Some serving and retired officers were also critical of Rawat’s comments. CPM’s Sitaram Yechury said, “The Army chief ’s statement underlines as to how the situation has degenerated under the Modi government.”He said the situation showed how an officer in uniform had brazenly breached the limits of his institutional role. Telangana Congress president and Lok Sabha MP Uttam Reddy said, “General Rawat, please don’t forget the code of conduct for serving military officers... A serving Army chief publicly trying to please political masters of the day on an extremely sensitive public issue by criticising opposition leaders! How unbecoming!” Yechury said that the Indian armed forces are “going the Pakistan way of politicising the military” and said that the Army chief ’s comments were an “obnoxious interference in matters of democratic struggles. Former BJP member Yashwant Sinha also took exception to Rawat’s utterances. “...Army Chief Bipin Rawat wading into the current political controversy is a new low. Must be nipped in the bud,” he said.Swaraj India member and rights activist Yogendra Yadav said, “I agree with him (Gen Rawat). Yes, leaders should lead (people) in the appropriate direction. I am absolutely sure he has the PM of this country in mind when talking about that.”Serving and retired officers, who stressed that the armed forces are justifiably proud of their apolitical and secular ethos, maintained that Gen Rawat had “crossed the line yet again” by taking a public stand against the ongoing anti-CAA protests.Eastern Army Command chief Lt Gen Anil Chauhan earlier this month had also observed that the NDA government “was keen on taking hard decisions pending for a long time” — a statement that had raised eyebrows for its political overtones.Former Navy chief Admiral L Ramdas (retd) said Gen Rawat’s remarks were clearly “wrong”, stressing that armed forces personnel must follow the decades-old principle of “serving the country and not any political force”.In Video: Leaders are not those who lead people in inappropriate directions: Bipin Rawat"

NEW DELHI: The NIA has arrested a key member of a gang allegedly involved in recruiting radical Sikh youths for the outlawed SFS group on directions from foreign handlers in a bid to create unrest in the country, an official said on Tuesday.

Pargat Singh, 23, a resident of Punjab's Sri Muktsar Sahib, was arrested on Sunday and produced before a special NIA court in Mohali on Monday which remanded him to NIA custody until June 29, he said.

Singh is one of the key conspirators and recruiter of radical Sikh youths while working under the directions of handlers located abroad to further the activities of SFJ (Sikhs For Justice), which has been declared an unlawful association under the provisions of UA(P) Act, the official said.

The case was registered at the Sultanwind police station in Amritsar (City) in 2018 under sections of the IPC. During investigation, sections of the UA(P) Act and the Arms Act were added, the official said.

Punjab Police filed a charge sheet against 11 arrested accused in March 2019, he said.

The case was subsequently re-registered by the NIA on April 5 this year and taken over for investigation, the official of the premier investigation agency said.

The case is related to a series of acts of violence, including arson, in Punjab during 2017-18, carrying out of propaganda activities both online and on the ground, and campaigns in support of SFJ, he said.

The activities include pasting of posters in Delhi and various parts of Punjab by the groups of radicalised youths under the direction and financial assistance of SFJ handlers located abroad, the NIA official said.

The accused, including Singh, had received funds from their foreign handlers through various Money Transfer Service Scheme (MTSS) platforms, the official said.

Further investigation in the case is in progress, the NIA added.

NEW DELHI: A wide swathe of north-east Delhi — from Jafrabad to Chand Bagh and Karawal Nagar — was wracked by communal riots and incidents of rampant vandalism on Monday as anti- and pro-CAA groups clashed for over seven hours.It left fires burning in the streets — which were littered with stones, bricks and glass — with smoke scarring the landscape. Stone-pelting, firing and arson left one policeman and four others dead while over 60 were injured. These include two dozen cops, including a DCP, passersby and rioters.When night fell, incidents were still being reported with the situation very volatile. Prohibitory orders under Section 144 of CrPC have been imposed in the violence-affected areas. Curfew could be imposed any time if the situation deteriorated.Security personnel conducted flag marches in the evening and additional forces, including the CRPF, have been deployed.The deceased cop was identified as head constable Ratan Lal. DCP (Shahdara) Amit Sharma, currently in the ICU, is reported to be critical with severe head injuries and clots and bruises all over his body. He was dragged out of his official vehicle at Chand Bagh and it was set on fire.It is unclear whether the five died of gunshot injuries or blunt force trauma. An official confirmation on the cause of death will be made only after postmortem is conducted on Tuesday. The head constable was killed in Gokulpuri while the others were brought to GTB Hospital from undisclosed places and declared dead on arrival.ACP (Gokulpuri) Anuj Kumar, two CRPF personnel and three firemen were also injured. Many journalists were manhandled. Delhi Police is learnt to have filed multiple FIRs in connection with the violence. It has also filed four FIRs regarding Sunday’s violence in the same area.The area had witnessed protests and sporadic clashes on Sunday and it’s a mystery how police failed to anticipate and contain the situation.Violence was reported from Jafrabad, Chand Bagh, Maujpur , Bhajanpura , Kardampuri, Gokulpuri, Khajuri and Karawal Nagar as frenzied mobs went on the rampage torching vehicles, shops and a petrol pump and attacking anyone who came in their way or whom they suspected to be of the other religion.Full-fledged stone-pelting started between the anti- and pro-CAA groups around 10.30am in several areas in and around Jafrabad. The violence soon escalated, taking a communal turn. The mobs kept on growing in strength, and in no time, the two sides were throwing stones at each other from either side of the Yamuna canal, which runs parallel to the Metro tracks.In Maujpur, the protesters not only threw stones but also torched three vehicles and shops that had their shutters down. At least one house was set on fire and plumes of smoke were seen rising from the balcony. The protestors were also seen assaulting a man after striking him down. They were shouting slogans and did not let him go even though he was bleeding.The violence spiralled further around 1pm when rioters set fire to a petrol pump in Bhajanpura. Two school buses were also torched on the Bhajanpura-Yamuna Vihar border. All major roads were littered with bricks, stones and glass shards. At Bhajanpura Chowk, a fire tender was damaged by the protesters after it responded to an emergency call from the area.The role of the police has come under scrutiny as they have been accused of not acting promptly in the morning and being mute spectators to the violence at many places through the day. The cops were seen trying to chase away the rioters by throwing back their stones and firing tear gas shells but soon came face-to-face at several spots in the afternoon. There, they wielded lathis but it was of little use. At one point, an armed man — later identified as one Mohammed Shahrukh — was caught on camera confronting a lone cop. He opened multiple rounds of fire with a crowd of around a hundred people egging him on from a distance. He even pointed the gun at the cop’s face point-blank. Later in the evening, he was detained by the cops.Vehicular traffic remained restricted on road number 59, which leads to Bhajanpura on one side and Ghaziabad via the Gokulpuri flyover on the other, causing inconvenience to commuters and locals, including students. Many students were seen trying to nervously make their way back to home, asking the police for safe passage.Worried residents called up their relatives in different parts of the capital but few could reach them. Many were seen standing ahead of Jafrabad metro station towards Seelampur and asking people coming from the riot-hit zone if they were alright. “I had come to take my sister and her family but she told me people are pelting stones outside the house. I cannot reach her and I cannot leave her too,” said a 40-year old man.In one of the bylanes, a woman looked visibly worried as she waited for her grand daughter to return home. “I did not send the younger one to school but the elder one had to go. I regret sending her now. My heart is pounding with each passing minute,” she said. “My husband came here to collect some payment and the next call I got from him was that he was injured in the stone pelting,” said another woman. “Why are innocent people being attacked, we are not on any side,” said the woman."

The temple, circa 1943, before the arson

KOCHI: The idol at Sabarimala Temple was broken during an arson in 1950, according to an enquiry report submitted by then deputy inspector general of police (special branch, CID) K Kesava Menon.

First noticed by a priest on June 14, 1950, the arson was reported to police two days later by the commissioner and the president of Travancore Devaswom Board. The temple was last closed on May 20. The priest, his subordinates and some worshippers had left the place, with nobody staying back.

When Kollam district superintendent of police visited the place, he had noticed that, “The idol was found broken; the head, left hand palm and fingers separated. There were cut marks on the face of the idol as well as on the forehead.”

The enquiry had found out that the fire was not an accident. There were 15 cut marks of violence on the door leading to the sreekovil (sanctum sanctorum), indicating forcible entry, the report said. Police had found traces of brass on the sharp edge of an axe found from the spot. Theft attempt was ruled out as silver, gold and utensils were not taken away.

Apart from this, there were evidences of somebody forcibly entering store room and kitchen quarters and throwing out the vessels. Police also found a kerosene lantern in the sreekovil.

Menon said in his report that the arson could have happened on any of the nights of May 21 or 22, 1950. According to the official report, the acts of paili (forest watcher), whose duty was to detect unlicensed hunting in the forests, were suspicious. He had been part of a hunting team in the area near the temple during those days. The report also hinted at two landowning and politically powerful families of Kanjirappilly and adjoining areas who could have acted through the paili. The report, supposed to be tabled in the assembly, was never released officially. There was no further action on the findings.

AHMEDABAD: A Gandhinagar sessions court acquitted three youths, who were charged with causing mischief by arson and attempting to commit culpable homicide by throwing a firecracker into a house during the Diwali festival in 2018.

Gandhinagar police had arrested three youths – Rutvik Dutt , Aman Kaushal and Jonty D’Souza — for throwing a firecracker into a house in Sector 3 in Gandhinagar after midnight on November 9, 2018. A fourth juvenile was also charged for the alleged act.

The trio was arrested and put on trial based on a complaint by the person in whose house a fire was caused because a firecracker was thrown inside. The inhabitants were asleep at 2.45am when the firecracker was thrown. The youths ran away after the mischief, but one of them was caught at a distance. He revealed the names of the others.

The youths were booked under Sections 436, 308, 336, 285, 188 and 114 of the IPC – for mischief by fire with intent to destroy a house, attempt to commit culpable homicide, negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter, putting other’s life in danger and for violation of the notification prohibiting bursting of firecrackers after midnight.

When the trial took place before the principal sessions judge, the prosecution could not prove its case. It was established that a firecracker was thrown inside the house and it caused the fire, but there was no eyewitness to who actually threw the firecracker. The intention to cause fire was also not established. The witnesses did not identify the accused in court. The police had also not conducted the test identification parade during the probe.

PUNE: There was a mysterious fire at the office of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) at Dahanukar Colony in Kothrud late on the night on October 22, a day after the city voted for the state assembly elections.

MNS office-bearer, Hemant Sambhus (46) of Kothrud has lodged a complaint with the Alankar police station, following which the police have booked the unidentified persons.

No one was injured in the incident as the office was shut at the time, police said. A fibre sheet and some portion of a door was damaged in the incident, they added.

The workers rushed to the spot and extinguished the fire. The fire brigade was not alerted, according to the FIR.

Police are checking the CCTV cameras in the vicinity to ascertain those responsible for the fire. The MNS workers and police station officials said they suspect that the miscreants threw some fuel at the office’s door and set fire to it.

The Kothrud assembly constituency was in the limelight after state BJP president Chandrakant Patil — earlier the district guardian minister — and MNS candidate Kishor Shinde locked hotns for the seat.

Patil’s candidatuure was met with a slew of protests in the beginning, while Shinde was backed by the Nationalist Congress Party and Congress. Patil won the seat by 25,495 votes.

Yogi Adityanath (file photo)

LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday alleged that the Opposition is ""giving money"" for arson and ""sponsoring"" anti-CAA protests to mislead people.

He said the previous governments didn't have the courage to grant citizenship to persecuted religious minorities from neighbouring countries and now the opposition parties are creating confusion about the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

""The Opposition is giving money for arson and sponsoring sit-ins and agitations against the CAA to mislead people. But the people have stood behind Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji and against those who speak the language of our enemies,"" Adityanath said at a rally here in support of the CAA, which was also addressed by Union home minister Amit Shah.

Using a term which describes the disrobing of Mahabharata's Draupadi, the chief minister said, ""The Opposition is doing 'cheerharan' of the country and we can't sit silently in this situation.""

He also lauded the Modi government for enacting the CAA.

""I appreciate the Centre for this move. The previous governments did not have courage to take it up. Now Congress, BSP and SP are creating confusion among the people on the CAA and it's our responsibility to reach out to the people with correct information,"" he added.

Issues on which work should have been started after 1947 were taken up by the BJP after it got an absolute majority, Adityanath said.

""In the past six months, you (people) may have witnessed many changes. People in the country were disheartened and demoralised that these issues (CAA, Article 370, etc) might not be resolved. But as our election slogan says, 'Modi hai to mumkin hai' (It is possible if Modi is there), all the issues were resolved,"" he said.

After Independence, Congress governments had a chance to work on issues of terrorism, separatism and discrimination but they didn't, the chief minister said, adding that the BJP is dealing with them strictly.

""The Congress did not do anything while other opposition parties, whenever they got a chance, only played politics on crucial issues,"" he said.

""In Ayodhya, a 'kalank' (blot) of 500 years ended, (Article) 370 was abolished, we brought a law on triple 'talaq' and CAA,"" he added.

According to the CAA, members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan till December 31, 2014, to escape religious persecution there will not be treated as illegal immigrants but given Indian citizenship.

It does not include Muslims.

Those opposing the CAA contend that it discriminates on the basis of religion and violates the Constitution. They also allege that the CAA along with the National Register of Citizens is intended to target the Muslim community in India.

However, the central government has dismissed the allegations, maintaining that the law is intended to give citizenship to the persecuted people from the three neighbouring countries and not to take away anyone's citizenship.

NAGPUR: A day ahead of Union home minister Amit Shah ’s visit to the district on Friday to campaign for sitting BJP MLA Ambrishrao Atram, who is contesting from Aheri constituency, Maoists carried out a blast targeting security forces in South Gadchiroli. In another incident, the outlaws also torched three vehicles.

Though there was no confirmation of Maoist pamphlets being found near the places of arson and blast, these incidents are seemingly aimed at disrupting assembly elections, scheduled for October 21. Maoists are known to boycott polls, but no posters or banners have been found in the district from the Reds in view of the forthcoming election yet.

It’s learnt that some armed Maoists had set three road construction vehicles, including a JCB machine, on fire near Jijawandi village in Etapalli in the wee hours of Wednesday. Though police are yet to confirm the incident, sources from Etapalli stated that the rebels had targeted the vehicles parked at a road construction site. The rebels used fuel from the targeted vehicles to torch them.

In yet another incident, Maoists triggered a blast targeting security forces which were engaged in area domination exercise. It’s learnt that a combined squad of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Quick Response Team (QRT) of Hedri and personnel of armed out post of Gatta-Jambia was patrolling when some suspects were spotted. As the security forces started cordoning off the area, a powerful blast was triggered by the suspects. The forces fired a few rounds, but the outlaws managed to sneak away.

SP Shailesh Balkawade said there was prior information about an IED being planted and security personnel were moving to the spot.

KANPUR: Police have intensified vigil at hair salons across Kanpur after intelligence inputs that those accused of arson during protests against CAA were going for a complete makeover to evade identification and arrest.

This follows release of posters with photographs by the district administration to track and auction properties of those involved in violence to pay for damages. Kanpur police have put up posters and released videos of nearly 76 people allegedly involved in violence during last week’s protests. Three persons were killed and 13, including three policemen injured in violence.

As soon as police released photographs and videos of the suspects, they received inputs about rising footfalls at salons dotting Beconganj, Chamanganj, Nai Sadak and Latouche Road areas. “We roped in police personnel in ‘civvies’ to track down trouble makers. We are approaching salon owners and giving them posters of accused. We are also scanning CCTV cameras installed at salon shops and nearby areas,” said a senior police official.

Salon owners admitted to police that post-CAA violence, they were getting a flood of first-time customers for a makeover. “Despite harsh winters, many with thick beard were asking for a clean-shave look and those with long hair were seeking a bald look,” said Pawan (name changed), a hair-cutting salon worker.

AGRA: Two days after Saimra village under Khandauli police jurisdiction in Agra witnessed arson and stone-pelting over elopement of an inter-faith couple, an FIR was lodged against 250 unknown men on Thursday.

Speaking to TOI, superintendent of police (west) Ravi Kumar said, “We have booked these men under IPC sections 147 (riot), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house, etc) and 7 CLA Act. Police teams are identifying the accused involved in the attack. We will soon arrest the accused.”

“Situation at Saimra is now peaceful. We have assured local residents and victims of every possible help,” he added. Meanwhile, a few locals and victims claimed that police have not included names of those accused whom they identified and gave a written complaint against.

Badar, whose cycle shop was set ablaze, said, “We gave 18 names to the police but none of those names have been included in the FIR. Police is lenient towards the accused men. Total 15 shops were set on fire. We want justice.”

“On Thursday, police team and the accused came to meet us. One of the accused openly accepted his role in arson, but no action was taken,” alleged Badar. A team of village lekhpal visited Saimra and conducted assessment of the losses incurred by the accused men.

Nearly a dozen shops were set ablaze and heavy stone-pelting was reported in a remote village of Agra district, after a man and a minor girl from two different communities allegedly eloped.

The 15-year-old girl, who is a student of class IX, was living at her maternal grandfather’s house in Saimra village of Khandauli police jurisdiction, while the boy, who the police claims to be 18-years old, lived stone’s throw away. He is claimed to be class XII student.

The elder brother of the accused boy said, “He left with the 15-year-old girl for Delhi on Tuesday morning. Both of them were later tracked down and brought to Agra with the help of distant relatives. My brother is a class 11 student. He has made a mistake but the entire community should not be punished for his deeds. We are poor and afraid of being attacked again.”

AGRA: A day after several shops were set ablaze and heavy stone-pelting was reported from a remote village in Agra over the elopement of an inter-faith couple, tension still prevailed in the area on Wednesday with the victims claiming that the police are yet to take any action against the attackers.

On Wednesday, a group of 25 men visited the police station with a written complaint.

They said that police are yet to register a case in this regard.

Speaking to TOI, Badar, whose cycle shop was set on fire, said, “We are pursuing the local police since morning for an FIR against the attackers, but they have asked us to come on Thursday morning. We are scared.”

Vijay Singh, husband of the village head of Saimra , said, “The situation is critical in the village. There was a similar skirmish between two communities two months ago over the issue of a water channel on a farm field. Two men were then booked for assault.”

“The DM, ADG, IG and SSP had visited the area after Tuesday’s violence and assured action against the attackers. However, police are yet to file an FIR in this regard,” he added.

Khandauli station house officer Prashant Tyagi said, “We have received a written complaint and will lodge an FIR. However, we are busy in presenting the teenage boy to the juvenile board at present as he has been booked for kidnapping a minor girl which led to the violence.”

Police sources said that the girl would be handed over to her parents after recording her statement.

Bokaro: The recent spurt in Maoist activities in Giridih is emerging as a cause of concern for police ahead of parliamentary polls.

In a fresh incident, Maoists on Wednesday night targeted a road construction company site and torched mixer machine and other equipment at Harkatwau of Bandh panchayat under Pirtaad police station in Giridih.

Sources said that about a dozen armed Maoists reached the spot and asked daily wage earners staying there to vacate the place. Thereafter, they torched the machines that belonged to Ganesh Yadav Construction Company, which is engaged in building a road from Chirki to Rajganj. They also fired several rounds in the air.

The police visited the site only on Thursday morning. Girdih SP S K Jha said that they have launched a search operation in the area.

He added, “The motive of Maoists might be to disturb Lok Sabha polls. But we are vigilant and will give them a befitting reply.”

This is the fourth such incident in less than a week. On Sunday night, Maoists shot dead a villager in Kanadi after branding him a police informer. On Monday, one CRPF jawan got martyred and three Maoists were killed in an encounter under Bhelwaghati police station of Giridih. On Wednesday, the body of a student and AAP supporter was recovered from Bandh, the incident is suspected to be a handiwork of left-wing extremists.

Around 20 to 30 youths, many of them wielding rods, went on the rampage in the heart of Police Bazar, targeting shops, cars, traders and shoppers. They set fire to several vehicles, eyewitnesses said.

As news of the arson spread, markets across the East Khasi Hills, of which Shillong is a part, quickly downed shutters. Heavy midday traffic choked the roads as people who had stepped out, including office workers, rushed home early.

""Information is received that there is a serious deterioration of law and order, with reports of arson and vandalism and destruction of property and vehicles. These activites are likely to continue, causing serious breach of peace and tranquillity, and could lead to loss of life and property,"" deputy commissioner M War Nongbri said in the curfew order.

According to PTI, some cabinet ministers who were to accompany CM Conrad K Sangma to Delhi for a meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday night couldn't make it to Guwahati airport because of the unrest in neighbouring Assam .

Sangma, however, managed to reach the airport in time for his flight. The ministers will leave for Delhi on Friday by helicopter from Shillong, the agency quoted a source in the CM's office as saying.

Sangma's National People’s Party (NPP), an NDA ally, had voted in favour of the CAB in the Lok Sabha, with party MP Agatha Sangma mentioning that the 6th Schedule of the Constitution would ""insulate"" 97 per cent of Meghalaya from the bill. The state government aims to prevail on Shah to exempt the whole of Meghalaya from its purview.

Until Thursday afternoon, Shillong and the rest of the state had been calm even as Guwahati, less than 100km away, erupted. There were two anti-CAB processions in Shillong during the day, one by Congress activists in the afternoon and another from the Mothphran neighbourhood in the evening, Both protests were heavily policed and no untoward incident took place, officials said.

GUWAHATI: An office of the All Assam Students' Union (Aasu) in Nalbari district was damaged in a suspected arson attack on Monday night that the organisation claimed was the handiwork of those trying to disrupt the publication of the state's final National Register of Citizens (NRC) on August 31.

The incident in the Lower Assam town of Tihu occurred within hours of the Union home ministry directing the state government to declare a state of high alert in the run-up to the scheduled publication of the citizenship rolls.

“The attack on our office is part of a conspiracy to cause disruption and uncertainty ahead of the publication of the final NRC. Aasu appeals to everyone to keep calm. We are hopeful that the state will get an error-free NRC on August 31,” Aasu president Dipanka Kumar Nath and general secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi said in a joint statement on Tuesday.

Outfits aligned with the Sangh Parivar have upped the tempo of their campaign to stall the publication of the final NRC till a comprehensive ""re-verification"" of all citizenship applications is carried out. Their apprehensions stem from unconfirmed reports about the exclusion of a large number of Hindus from the final rolls.

In 2017, activists of the Nikhil Bharat Bangali Udbastu Samannay Samiti had ransacked an Aasu office at Silapathar in Upper Assam’s Dhemaji district . The organisation has been demanding citizenship for Hindu migrants who arrived from Bangladesh , pitting it against Aasu, which treats any post-1971 migrant as a foreigner.

“If they (protesters) have something to say about the NRC, they should have approached the Supreme Court. At this stage, demanding that the publication of NRC be postponed smacks of vested interest and an attempt to derail the entire process,” the Aasu general secretary said.

The Gauhati high court on Tuesday announced the appointment of 221 retired officials to 200 additional foreigners' tribunals. These tribunals are being set up in anticipation of a rush of re-verification claims after the final updated NRC is published 10 days from now.

Anyone who does not make it to the final NRC will immediately be referred to a foreigners' tribunal by the police. Assam has 100 such tribunals, set up in phases since 2005. The state government has set itself a target of forming 1,000 tribunals, of which 200 are ready to start functioning next month, commissioner and secretary (home and political) Ashutosh Agnihotri said.

Heavy police presence in the Eidgah area in Jaipur on Tuesday

JAIPUR: For past 20 days, the dingy alleys in the Walled City areas had been in the grip of a simmering tension that had reached a boiling point when two communities clashed on Monday night.

Police, however, failed to anticipate despite intelligence inputs and two incidents that should have ideally served as a warning of what was to follow.

On July 24, a frenzied crowed had blocked the highway and targeted vehicles passing through the road. “That night there was a heavy downpour due to which the mob was forced to a make a hasty retreat. One bus was vandalised, but the situation was control. If police had made adequate arrangements, things would not have not gone out of control,” said Deen Dayal Gupta, a local resident. The final warning shots were fired when a few Kanwarias were injured in a clash with locals near Char Darwaja area under Ramganj police station on Sunday night. Police did not pay heed to the incident and marked it off as a “minor tussle.” Sunday’s incident, however, had set-off a series of events that finally translated on Monday evening when after Eid payers two communities came at loggerheads again.

The police was caught off guard as by Monday evening the japta (deployment) had begun to retreat. The sources in the intelligence wing of the police said all four police zones of Jaipur police commissionerate were put on a high alert several days ago.

“The intelligence inputs had specified police station areas. Monday was the last of shravan somvars which coincided with Eid. The police should have been extra vigil. We had also told the police in advance to remain alert following Union government’s decision to revoke Jammu and Kashmir’s special status,” an official told TOI.

A senior police officer said deployment indeed was not adequate. He said police were also probing if the violence waspre-planned.

A vendor sits outside closed shops in Srinagar (PTI)

SRINAGAR: In a partial shutdown, shops remained closed and public transport stayed off roads in Srinagar and south Kashmir on Thursday following previous night’s arson and appearance of threatening posters in the city’s downtown areas. On Wednesday night, miscreants had set on fire four shops, as many street carts and a cab.

Srinagar district magistrate Shahid Iqbal Choudhary on Thursday issued a strict warning to miscreants, who were threatening residents of the district. The DM urged people to immediately report instances of intimidation at local police stations, assuring them that action would follow immediately and that the miscreants would be dealt with sternly.

Police said cases had been registered in all the incidents of fire and that investigation was on. Those involved in burning of these properties would be arrested soon, police said, adding that these incidents showed the ‘frustration’ of the people who wanted to prolong the shutdown in Kashmir.

Shops and public transport, however, plied normally in north Kashmir on Thursday, reports said.

All shops, business establishments and public transport, including cabs, had started functioning normally since November 16 after almost 100 days of shutdown starting August 5 when Parliament took the decision to nullify Article 370 and reorganize the state of J&K into two Union Territories. However, the problem resurfaced after Union home minister Amit Shah announced in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday that the situation in Kashmir had become normal.

Soon after Shah’s Parliament remark, miscreants pasted posters at several places in the city, threatening people to observe shutdown in the Valley. Not just that, they also set on fire shops, carts and a cab, sources said.

Public transport mostly stayed off city roads and some south Kashmir areas in reaction to the burning down of a Tavera vehicle (cab) in Nawa Kadal area of downtown Srinagar on Wednesday night.

Similarly, shops and other business establishments in many areas of south Kashmir and Srinagar district, including commercial hub Lal Chowk , remained closed on Thursday following the burning down of shops and appearance of threating posters the previous night.

Reports said that four shops were gutted in a fire incident in Bohri Kadal area of Srinagar. “The incident took place on Wednesday evening around 7pm,” an official source said, adding that the cause of the blaze was being ascertained.

The source further said that four carts of street vendors were set on fire in Soura area of Srinagar around 10.30pm on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, police in Awantipora arrested an associate of a terrorist for his involvement in threatening and intimidating locals in Tral area. He has been identified as Asif Ahmad Bhat, a resident of Larow Jageer, Tral.

Police and firemen managed to douse the fire after battling flames for hours

KANPUR: Agitated over the arrest of fellow farmers and leaders, villagers of Gangaghat area in Shuklaganj, Unnao , who had fought a six-hour long pitched battle with police on Saturday, continued protest and allegedly set afire plastic pipes and a construction material mixer.

Police officials said, the PVC pipes were kept in a godown of Uttar Pradesh State Industrial Development Corporation (UPSIDC), which has acquired the land for Trans-Ganga City project.

As the plastic pipes caught fire, tall flames arose and huge plumes of dense smoke engulfed the air, causing panic in the area. Police and firemen rushed to the spot to control the situation and managed to douse the fire after battling flames for two hours. No one was injured in the blaze.

A construction material mixing vehicle was also set ablaze but the fire was doused soon, not causing much damage to it.

KALYANI: Seven rounds were fired in the air, four bikes were set ablaze and two cars damaged during a clash between Trinamool and BJP supporters at Kalyani in Nadia on Saturday night. Five persons were arrested.

Trouble broke out when Trinamool’s Kalyani town president Arup Mukherjee and party workers were in Jogesh Colony to meet a colleague who had been beaten up, allegedly by BJP-backed miscreants, sources said.

While returning with the injured person, Mukherjee said he got information that another party worker had been targeted by BJP men. “We returned to rescue him. But some 40-50 BJP workers attacked us with rods, bamboo poles and firearms. They even fired a few rounds and set ablaze four bikes of our partymen and damaged two four-wheelers,” he alleged. A complaint has been lodged with Kalyani police, Mukherjee added.

BJP leaders denied the charge. “Trinamool men attacked Jogesh Colony to terrorise people as many there are now with BJP,” one of them said. “They came to the locality at 7.30pm to instil fear in the minds of people. Enraged locals chased the Trinamool goons. They (goons) fired seven rounds in the air while doing so.”

BJP claimed innocents had been arrested and demanded their release. The party lodged a complaint with Kalyani police.

Bijnor: A court here has rejected the bail application of 30 people booked for arson and rioting during the anti-CAA protests and clashes in December last year. Additional district and sessions judge Sanjeev Pandey rejected the bail pleas on Thursday evening by saying, “Crime is of serious magnitude. Therefore bail pleas are rejected.”

Giving details, additional district government counsel Sanjeev Verma told TOI, “The judge heard the bail pleas of 32 accused on Thursday. Out of them, bail applications of 30 were rejected.”

“The judge cited in his order that 36 vehicles, including an ambulance, cars and motorcycles were vandalized. Protesters attacked policemen and civilians. Seven persons, including five policemen and a photo journalist, sustained injuries. 22 people whose properties were damaged during the protest in Bijnor had filed complaints against the protesters. Petrol bottles, batons, illegal arms and stones were recovered from their possession. And the protesters were arrested from the spot. Keeping all these facts and circumstances in mind, the accused cannot be granted bail,” Verma said.

The anti-CAA clashes took place in Bijnor city and its several areas including Nagina, Nahtaur, Najibabad, Jalalabad, Chandpur, and Sherkot. Police had registered 34 cases against 3,900 protestors in the district. Of them, 149 protesters were arrested and sent to jail.

KOLKATA: A fire reported inside an empty ground floor room of the four-storey Linton Hostel has led its inhabitants — junior doctors and MBBS students of Chittaranjan National Medical College and Hospital (CNMCH) — to allege that miscreants had deliberately set their hostel on fire in the wee hours of Thursday.

Though the inhabitants and locals managed to control the fire, the cops at Beniapukur said they are not entirely ruling out the possibility of the fire starting outside. “We are calling forensic experts to ascertain how it originated,” said DC (southeast) Ajoy Prasad. The residents of the hostel located on Linton Road opposite CNMCH alleged that petrol bombs were hurled at them in order to “teach them a lesson” as they had decided to stand in solidarity with the junior doctors of NRS Hospital.

According to police, the fire was reported around 1.25am. “The fire broke out in an empty room at the ground floor of the (G+3) building. Locals extinguished the fire around 1.35am even as two fire tenders attended to the fire spot. No report of injury or entrapment has been reported. Cops ensured the situation remained peaceful,” said an officer in a terse statement from Lalbazar. Beniapukur police have launched a probe.

Nilotpal Nandi, the former president of CNMCH students’ union, claimed the cops were misleading since at least three rooms were affected. “Neither were they empty nor was the fire doused without any damages,” he said. “The residents of A9 (the room that’s now completely burnt) are medical students, who haven’t yet completed MBBS. All their belongings, including marksheets, are all gone. Their books are all burnt to ashes. The money that their parents sent were also lost. Only the smell of kerosene and smoke now fills the room,” Nandi wrote on his Facebook page, a post that went viral.

Nandi added that he has CCTV footages (that he has shared) of strangers roaming inside the hostel compound with “sticks and stumps and are repeatedly asking about the whereabouts of doctors”. “This is intimidating to say the least. But, this would not have been possible if the administration was really serious about our security,” said Soumava Chatterjee, an intern and a hostel resident. “We are being threatened to change our stance,” said Chatterjee.

KOCHI: Rahul Raj , 26, a resident of Ambattukavu in Aluva, was arrested by North police on Tuesday on charges of arson. Police said that the youth set on fire the property of a paying guest owner after he suspected that owner might have revealed the truth about his wife’s previous marriages, a fact he concealed from his friends.

Police said that the house did not sustain much damage but three vehicles parked on the porch –a scooter, bike and car – were gutted in the fire. The incident happened on December 4 near PJ Antony Ground around 11 pm. Based on CCTV footage obtained from the area, police launched an investigation and zeroed in on Raj, who confessed everything.

Police said that the accused committed the crime out of enmity. He felt that house owner, Sai Prasad, was responsible for his personal issues that allegedly created problems in his family. “His wife, Ann Mariya (32), was a paying guest at Prasad’s house for a few months in 2017 before their marriage. Within a few weeks she vacated the place following issues with Prasad and his family. In June 2018, she married Rahul, her third husband. She had married in 2012 and 2015 and had obtained divorce both times. Raj had not revealed this to his friends and relatives,” said the police.

Problems started a month ago after Raj’s family and friends found that Mariya had married before. Some pictures of her second marriage turned up on Facebook recently. This created trouble in his family and his friends started taunting him. “The accused doubted that it was Prasad and his family members who posted the photos on Facebook. He reached the house around 10.50pm on December 4 and set the vehicles on fire after pouring petrol on them. The blaze was doused by the fire and rescue team after three-hour battle,” said SI Anaz V D, who investigated the case.

Union minister Babul Supriyo

KOLKATA: A group of prominent personalities of West Bengal , including film director Aparna Sen , on Friday expressed concern over the violence and arson that took place during and after the visit of Union minister Babul Supriyo to Jadavpur University campus on Thursday.

In a statement here, 15 personalities said there is cause to worry over the behaviour of the minister with the vice-chancellor of the university and the conduct of Supriyo's security personnel with the students.

""The protesting students should also have behaved in a restrained manner keeping in mind the restive atmosphere in the entire country.... Students should not be treated as hardened criminals in a healthy environment,"" they said.

Urging the state government to conduct a probe into the incident and punish the guilty, they called upon politicians not to do anything which will disturb the academic atmosphere of the university campus and tackle any emerging situation in a democratic way and not by violent means.

Supriyo, a singer-turned BJP leader, was shown black flags and heckled by a section of Jadavpur University students, who also stopped him from leaving the campus. Supriyo was in the university to attend an event organised by the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP).

The personalities under the banner of 'Citizenspeak India' said they are also stunned and scared over the incident of ""setting some objects on fire"" in the chain of events following the protest.

Apart from Aparna Sen, the signatories included thespian Kaushik Sen, actor Riddhi Sen, singer Rupam Islam, social activist-columnist Bolan Gangopadhyay and others."

NEW DELHI: Nearly 35 years after their alleged involvement in violence and arson during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, the Supreme Court on Tuesday reversed concurrent judgments of the trial court and Delhi high court and acquitted seven persons who were sentenced to five years in jail.

Appearing for the convicts, senior advocate R Basant and advocate V Raghunath told a bench of CJI Ranjan Gogoi and Justices Deepak Gupta and Sanjiv Khanna that they were picked up randomly by police for violating curfew imposed after the rioting and that there was no evidence to link them to rioting or arson.

The trial court in 1996 had convicted 88 people on these charges and the Delhi HC had in November last year upheld their conviction and sentence while asking them to surrender and undergo rigorous imprisonment. The SC on Tuesday took up appeals of seven of the 88 convicts.

Referring to the prosecution evidence, the CJI-led bench said it unhesitatingly took the view that the prosecution witnesses have neither identified the accused nor placed any evidence against them before the court. “It is a classic case of no evidence against the accused,” the bench said and ordered their acquittal from the case.

Appearing for the prosecution, additional solicitor general Pinky Anand suggested that in a case involving many accused, the prosecution should be permitted to apply ‘mechanical test’ to produce evidence against key persons to rope in others who were accompanying them. But, the SC said it did not see how the mechanical test would help the prosecution when it was a case of ‘no evidence at all’. “The offence alleged against the accused is rioting. But without any evidence and their identification by the witnesses, they cannot be convicted,” it said.

CHENNAI: Five suspects were arrested on Thursday for arson and vandalism at Nallur toll plaza on Wednesday. Search is on for those who stole cash from the plaza counters during the clash. Police plan to comb the neighbouring villages to narrow down the suspects.

Truck and van drivers vandalized the toll plaza in the city’s northern suburbs after the staff roughed up some of them for questioning the hike in rates for monthly passes. Chaos reigned at the Nallur toll plaza in Thiruvallur bringing traffic to a standstill along the Chennai-Kolkata highway for more than an hour. Police registered two separate cases and arrested five people from both sides, who were later remanded in Puzhal prison.

Meanwhile, the toll plaza manager lodged a fresh complaint at Sholavaram police station demanding legal action against the suspects who stole cash from the collection booths. The officials have also given CCTV camera footage of some people attacking and damaging the computers at the toll booth and stealing cash from the counters.

The toll plaza, established in 2009 by the NHAI, is maintained by a private concessionaire. Until last financial year, the monthly pass cost Rs 150 and Rs 300 for local traffic within 10km and 10-20km radius from the plaza. Toll rates were revised on April 1. The manifold increase in rate of monthly passes resulted in protests by local truck and van drivers during the second week of April.

Daltonganj: Unidentified miscreants set ablaze three earth-movers and mining equipment at Dantuta stone quarry , barely 8km from Chhaterpur police station at Cheeru panchayat late on Wednesday. Police has ruled out the involvement of Maoists in the incident.

Palamu SP Indrajeet Mahatha said locals living in the vicinity have been opposing the quarry citing risks to their lives were involved in the arson . Barely 150 meters from the mine are villages whose residents claimed blasts at the quarry shake their houses and put their families at risk.

“No hand-written leaflets were found at the site. The arsonists did not raise slogans swearing allegiance to naxal outfits,” Mahatha said, quoting Chhaterpur sub-divisional police officer Shambhu K Singh.

Villagers sat on a dharna on Palamu collectorate premise a few months ago claiming quarry operations will contaminate water sources, pollute the area and affect commute to villages in its proximity. Soon after, the then Chhaterpur SDO Chhaterpur B Thakur and district mines officer M Toppo inspected the site but a solution to the villagers’ problems were not found.

Sources said the arson is a case of direct conflict of interest of villagers with the quarry owner identified as Anjani Singh. Residents of two villages Cheeru and Pattkhaiyee were most vocal against this mine.

Mahatha added: “This quarry has seen a few ugly scenes in the past where unidentified people had thrashed the staff here to make them run away from here.” Police was also informed that quarry workers had fired bullets in the air recently to scare the villagers.

LUCKNOW: The UP government on Friday declined prosecution sanction sought by the CB-CID for two police officers in connection with arson in the house of Rita Bahuguna Joshi in 2009. Presently a BJP MP from Allahabad, Joshi was UP Congress Committee chief then.

The officers involved are then-SSP Lucknow Prem Prakash who is now posted as ADG (Kanpur zone) and then-ASP Lucknow (east) Harish Kumar who is DIG Police Training School (Gorakhpur).

Saying it saw no need for prosecution of the two, the government has sought departmental action against Prakash and charged him with minor penalties. Kumar will have to undergo a departmental inquiry but face major penalties.

The government has granted prosecution sanction against then-CO ( Hazratganj ) BS Garbayal, then-SHO Hussainganj-Baliram Saroj and 14 others, accused of framing innocent people instead of the real arsonists.

On July 15, 2009, Joshi had attacked the Mayawati government’s policy of giving monetary compensation to Dalit rape survivors. In her speech, she had allegedly made a derogatory reference to then CM Mayawati.“Will Mayawati settle for a compensation of Rs 1 crore if she were to suffer the indignity herself,” she had said. A few hours later, Joshi was arrested. After investigation, she was remanded to judicial custody for 14 days by the chief judicial magistrate.

On the same night, a group of masked men stormed Joshi’s house at Sarojini Naidu Marg in Lucknow armed with iron rods, sticks and petrol cans. They went on the rampage, sprinkled petrol and set the house ablaze.

CB-CID investigation found the role of then- BSP MLA Jitendra Kumar Singh alias Bablu along with Intezar Abidi alias Bobby in the arson.

In 2015, CB-CID had sought prosecution of 18 police officers for framing innocent people for the incident.

RAMPUR: Unidentified miscreants have been booked for allegedly attempting to set on fire a place of worship after an altercation over loudspeaker in Ratanpura-Shumali village under the jurisdiction of Azeem Nagar police station here on Thursday morning.

Swar-Tanda circle officer Rahul Kumar said the fire gutted religious books and other articles of religious importance, but no injury was reported.

Azeem Nagar SHO Rajeev Kumar said, “An FIR has been registered against unidentified miscreants under section 295 (injuring or defiling place of worship with intent to insult the religion of any class) and 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house, etc) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).”

As tension prevailed in the village after the incident, police officers rushed to the spot. “The incident took place around 10.45am, and soon, police personnel from Azeem Nagar station house and a reserve battalion from police lines and personnel from five other police stations were rushed to the spot. Although nobody was injured, a team of forensic experts collected evidence from the spot,” said Rahul.

“Local residents told police that when they saw smoke billowing out of ventilators of the structure, they rushed there and put out the flames,” Rahul added.

Assuring the residents that police would bring the perpetrators to justice, Rahul said, “We will not tolerate such incidents. We have already launched a manhunt to arrest the culprits. They will be behind bars soon and the National Security Act (NSA) will also be invoked against them.”

Appealing to people to maintain peace, Ratanpura-Shumali pradhan Iftayqar Ali said, “Such incidents have never taken place in the village. Altercation over loudspeaker was not a big issue and could have been resolved amicably.”

Meanwhile, police suspect drug addicts to be behind the incident. “Investigation is going on. Police teams are working on it and soon the perpetrators will be arrested.”

A burnt earth mover of the firm in Gomia on Thursday

BOKARO: An armed squad of Maoists led by Mithlesh Singh , alias Duryodhan Mahto, set on fire several vehicles and equipment at a bridge construction site between Lodhi and Kodwa villages under Chatrochati police station in Gomia block on Wednesday night. The incident happened on the foothills of Jhumra hills , at a time when security forces intensified raids to nab a squad of 15-20 Maoists.

Bokaro SP P Murgum said, “A joint police team of district police and CRPF launched a search operation to nab the Maoists in forested areas under Chatrochati police station. We have intensified security in the area.”

Police said no one was injured in the incident. The workers were resting inside a room at the site of the construction company, Malti Construction, when the armed squad came and set the vehicles on fire. They also reportedly thrashed the site supervisor and another worker of the company before leaving.

“Police will provide security to construction companies engaged in developmental works,” Murgum added.

Loknath Mahto, the site supervisor, told police a dozen-odd men raided their site on Tuesday night and demanded to know how they could start the construction work without taking ‘permission’ from them. Mahto said vehicles and equipment, including an earthmover, a generator, mixer machine and a tractor, worth about Rs 50 lakh, were damaged in the arson .

Although police refused to comment if the rebels attacked the construction site to demand extortion money or to register their presence, local sources said that the attack followed after the proprietor of the company reportedly denied to pay money to the banned outfit.

Maoist commander Mithlesh Singh carries a reward of Rs 1 crore on his head.

A bandh supporter vandalizes a bus during Bharat bandh in Patna (Photo: PTI)

PATNA: Widespread arson , vandalism and disruption of rail and road traffic marked the Bharat bandh in Bihar on Monday even as the Centre held the protesters responsible for the death of a girl in Jehanabad while being taken to a hospital.

Slamming the Congress, Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad cited the death of the 2-year-old girl as he claimed the pro-bandh supporters prevented the girl from getting timely medical attention. He asked whether Congress president Rahul Gandhi would take responsibility for the death. However, Jehanabad DM Alok Ranjan Ghosh denied the allegation and blamed diarrhoea for her death.

The bandh was called by the Congress and supported in Bihar by RJD, Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular), Nationalist Congress Party, Samajwadi Party and the six-party Left combine of CPI(ML), CPI, CPM, SUCI, Forward Bloc and RSP against unchecked rise in the prices of petrol, diesel and LPG, among other issues.

The supporters of suspended RJD MP Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav, the patron of Jan Adhikar Party-Loktantrik (JAP-L), went on the rampage in the state capital and vandalized cars, buses and auto-rickshaws plying on the roads and roughed up commuters. The police resorted to severe lathicharge at the Income Tax roundabout to clear the blockade erected by JAP-L supporters to make the passage for a high court judge’s car.

Incidentally, the JAP-L led by Pappu Yadav had not been invited to support the bandh. Without taking names, the leader of opposition in the state assembly and de facto RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav accused Pappu of being the “agent” of the BJP to do “negative politics” on its behalf. Tejashwi also called him “less of a leader and more of an actor” whose party workers indulged in violence to “bring bad name to the state.” Tejashwi joined the bandh around 12.30pm.

State BJP chief Nityanand Rai alleged that the workers of RJD and Congress indulged in hooliganism and smashing of the government and private vehicles. “They forcibly closed the shops. Congress president Rahul Gandhi and Tejashwi should be held responsible for violence during the bandh,” he added.

At least 50 pairs of passenger trains were forcibly detained by the bandh supporters at different places under the East Central Railway (ECR). ECR’s chief public relations officer Rajesh Kumar said the Danapur division was the worst affected. “Bandh supporters did not allow movement of at least 20 passenger trains on the Kiul-Gaya, Patna-Gaya, Patna-Jhajha, Rajgir-Bakhtiarpur, Mokama-Barauni and Patna-Mughalsarai sections since early morning,” he said.

According to a release issued by the DGP control room, 678 people were held across the state by way of preventive arrests, the maximum number of which took place in Patna district (219) followed by Gopalganj (214), Nalanda (141) and Aurangabad (61).

Vehicles remained off the roads for the major part of the day in 38 district and over 600 small and medium towns besides the subdivisional and block headquarters. Passengers at Patna Junction and Mithapur bus stand were stranded and hugely inconvenienced. Protesters clashed with police personnel in some localities and forced shopkeepers to down their shutters. Most of the private schools and colleges remained closed.

Student organisations affiliated to different political parties marched from Darbhanga House to Kargil Chowk while JAP(L) supporters blocked railway tracks at Rajendra Nagar Terminal.

Some shops, which had been opened in the morning, were forcefully closed by the bandh supporters. Raman Choudhary, who runs a garment shop at Rajdhani Market, said the protesters forced him to down the shutters and warned him with dire consequences if he disobeyed them.

Even cinema halls in the state capital remained closed. Saroj Kumar, who had booked movie tickets, was disappointed as the e-tickets were automatically cancelled when he reached the hall along with his friend.

Normal functioning in banks was also affected as very few customers turned up in the first half. Sonam Kumari, a bank employee, said the footfall of customers was less comparing to other days in the morning hours. “However, the customers started visiting our bank branch after the lunch break. We also faced difficulties in reaching the bank due to lack of public transport on roads,” she said.

Few vehicles, including cars, motorcycles, auto-rickshaws, e-rickshaws and cycle rickshaws were, however, seen plying in some localities. Sarvottam Kumar Singh, a private firm employee, said bandhs should not be organised on working days as they cause inconvenience to common people.

KOLKATA: The Burrabazar police on Sunday arrested Kushal Gupta, BJP's North Kolkata Yuva Morcha vice-president, for setting a state bus on fire off the Brabourne Road flyover on September 26, during a BJP bandh.

Gupta was arrested at the Kolkata airport immediately on return to the city on a Varanasi-Kolkata flight.

Cops said Gupta had been on the run since they arrested Sanjib Singh (Chulbul), a Naihati resident, who got his hands burnt while setting the bus ablaze. Police sources said the FIR lodged cited 7-8 persons for trying to set the bus, with seven passengers in it, on fire. The attackers had reportedly shouted, ""Bandh- er dine kaaj dekhachish, puriye marbo sobaike. (You are working on a bandh day, we will burn you alive)"". Police claimed two persons, including Sanjib, had entered the bus while the others, including Gupta, tried to stop people from stepping out.

Gupta is a Burrabazar resident. ""His mother and brother stay here. His brother is a shop-owner. Gupta has been a strong BJP activist for the past two-and-a-half years,"" said an officer. With his name cropping up during the probe, the Burrabazar police launched a manhunt for him but could not track him. According to sources, while the cops were studying the passenger lists of Kolkata-bound aircraft, they stumbled on his name and arrested him upon arrival. ""He probably thought that the dust had settled and that it was safe for him to return,"" said a senior police officer.

Police said witnesses who recorded their statements claimed they clearly remembered seeing a man in yellow kurta and white pyjamas getting on the bus armed with a bottle of liquid. They also claimed multiple people were seen shouting pro-bandh slogans, egging on the two men who had climbed onto the bus. Multiple passengers - including the injured Vidyasagar traffic guard constable Bidesh Samanta, one of the bus passengers, some daily wage-earners and the bus employees - also recalled Singh getting his hands burnt while setting the bus on fire. The reports from the hospital match their statements, police said.

No BJP leader agreed to be quoted on this. ""We are keeping a close watch,"" said a leader.

MEERUT: A day after a massive fire tore through Meerut ’s Bhusamandi locality and reduced over 100 houses to ashes, inconsolable people of the area picked up pieces from the ruins which presented a gloomy picture. The blaze started Wednesday evening, soon after a widespread clash between locals and police teams which had come to clear encroachments in the area. The ash-laden air was also thick with allegations and counter-allegations over who started the fire. Locals blamed police for the fire, a charge denied by senior officers.

Most of the people whose homes were destroyed in the fire were forced to spend night in open, even as the winter chill continued to take its toll.

Meanwhile, a magisterial inquiry was also ordered by the administration into the entire incident. Police force accompanied by Rapid Action Force ( RAF ) contingents were also deployed in the area. Two FIRs were also filed in the case, one by Sadar police station and the other by Cantonment Board.

Zulfikar Ali, a daily wage labourer who lost all the items he had bought for his daughter’s marriage, blamed police and property dealer. “Everything is destroyed including products worth Rs 1.5 lakhs I had arranged for my daughter’s wedding. I don’t know what my fault was. I had purchased this 30 sq yard land from a property dealer and had built four walls with a tin roof where my family of nine lived. On Wednesday, police came and tried to demolish several homes. When we resisted, they set the locality on fire.”

Police have refuted the charges.

Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Nitin Tiwari said: “The allegations are completely false. Why would police set up fire? At the same time we cannot say that the residents did it. The reason is still not known. Most probably it was caused by accident. Magisterial inquiry is on and everything will be clear once it is complete. Meanwhile, two FIRs have been filed, one by the Sadar police and another by Cantonment Board against unknown persons. Once investigations begin, miscreants will be identified on the basis of evidence and adequate action will be taken against them.”

PUNE: The police on Saturday arrested four members of a mandal for setting ablaze a man’s motorcycle after he refused to give them Rs500 as a “voluntary contribution” for the Dahi Handi festival.

The incident took place at Ambegaon Pathar during the wee hours of Saturday. Two motorcycles, parked on either side of the gutted motorcycle, also sustained damage. The photographer, Praful Chandrakant Thorat (20) of Ambegaon, has lodged a complaint with the Bharati Vidyapeeth police.

The police later arrested the mandal members, identified as Datta Vijay Shinde, Omkar Sandeep Kamble, Datta Rahul Kadam and Sumeet Raju Ahiwale, all residents of Katraj.

According to the FIR, the incident took place at around 1.35am on Saturday. Shinde had gone to Thorat’s residence and informed them the mandal was celebrating Dahi Handi on Monday. Shinde then demanded a voluntary contribution of Rs500 from Thorat.

When Thorat refused to pay up, the men set ablaze his motorcycle. Speaking to TOI, Chandrakant Thorat said, “Me and my son were not at home when the mandal members visited around 9.30pm on Saturday. My wife told them to speak to me. I came home and met the mandal members downstairs. I promised them a contribution of Rs51,” he said.

Thorat said, “I am an autorickshaw driver. I work the entire day and get Rs500 by the evening. The amount was too high for me and so I requested them to take Rs51 as a voluntary contribution, which is all I can afford to pay,” he said.

“They threatened me when I told them that they cannot force me to shell out Rs500,” he said. It is suspected that the mandal members took petrol from the fuel tank of a motorcycle parked near Thorat’s. “Our motorcycle has a fuel lock. The other two motorcycles didn’t have it,” Thorat said.

Police have invoked sections 436 (Mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house, etc.) and 120 (b) (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code against the four mandal members.

KANNUR: Incidents of arson and stone pelting were reported in Kasargod district during the state-sponsored 'Women's Wall' event on Tuesday.

Some participants and policemen also sustained injuries after a gang, suspected to be BJP and RSS workers gathered near the railway track set the grass on fire to prevent women from participating in the event.

When the police tried to control the mob, they started pelting stones. The police then resorted to cane-charge and used teargas to disperse them.

Police said the gang, first threatened the women and when they ignored it they set the dry grass on fire alongside the railway tracks at Chettukundu near Kanhangad.

The gang also vandalized some shops including a roadside eatery run by Kudumbashree women, police said.

LDF sources said Chettukundu is a BJP-RSS stronghold and hence women from the Panathady panchayat were deputed here to form the wall.

The mob also assaulted some media camera persons.

Meanwhile, the Women’s Wall proved to be a huge success in Kannur and Kasaragod districts. In Kannur, the numbers crossed 6.25 lakh, though they expected only around 5 lakh participants, said the organisers. Kasaragod also saw a huge turnout exceeding the expectation of one lakh women.

This is the third incident of arson in the past 20 days in Thane

THANE: As many as 18 bikes were completely charred and a laundry unit was partially damaged in Chandanwadi area of Thane in the wee hours of Tuesday. The police immediately tracked down the accused and arrested him. The incident has triggered fear among locals as this is the third arson incident in less than 20 days.

During interrogation, accused, Gaurav Palvi, 21, a resident of Chandanwadi area told the police that personal rivalry with one of the bike owners was motivation for the crime.

DCP DS Swamy said that the complainant, Tushar Bhoir, owns a laundry in the basement of one of the three buildings in a housing society.

A couple of days back, Bhoir had an altercation with Palvi’s uncle. Bhoir was beaten up and a non-cognizable offence registered against Palvi’s uncle with Naupada police. Palvi decided to take revenge and torched Bhoir’s bike. Due to the fuel, the fire spread to other bikes which were completely charred. The laundry was also partially damaged. Bhoir’s loss is compounded by the fact that he did not have insurance for the bike.

The police said the accused was tracked on the basis of information as well as CCTV footage. The accused is said to be a close aide of a goon in the city and has been earlier arrested for rioting, said the officer.

The police, in this case, have booked the accused for attempt to commit culpable homicide , mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house, mischief causing damage.

On December 6, around nine two-wheelers were burnt down and two arrested. Personal feud had triggered the crime. The police said a local had registered two non-cognizable complaints against one of the accused and he wanted to teach him a lesson.

On December 14, three bikes were set on fire in Patlipada and history-sheeter Chetan Thakur was arrested. He was inebriated and had even smashed the window panes of three cars.

Alleging inept patrolling, locals slammed the Thane police for their casual attitude toward the law and order situation in the city. The police, on the other hand, blamed it on illegal parking on roads.

A police officer added, “Such incidents occur mostly due to old cases of rivalry. The intention may not be to harm the rival directly, but cause financial loss and inflict agony.”

ROHTAK: Apparently shaken by the arrest of two of its key activists by the CBI in 2016 violence case, the All India Jat Arakshan Sangrash Samiti (AIJASS) on Sunday announced to socially boycott state finance minister Capt Abhimanyu. In a district-level meeting held on Sunday at Jassia village, headquarters of AIJASS, the body passed a proposal to ban ‘huka-paani’ of the minister whose Rohtak house was vandalized in February 2016 during the Jat quota stir.

Pawan Jassia and Sombir Jassia, two key aides of AIJASS chief Yashpal Malik who were declared proclaimed offender by police after they were did not appear before investigation agencies, were arrested by CBI last week. Pawan was arrested in Rohtak while Sombir was nabbed in Karnal .

Venting out anger against Capt Abhimanyu, AIJASS general secretary Krishan Lal Hooda said that the delegation of samiti had tried to break ice between the minister and the accused to settle the matter out of court but he did not budge.

“The youths who were named in arsoning of his Rohtak residence during 2016 Jat stir were innocent and were not associated. Jat delegation wanted to make this point before the minister but he did not care for the future of these youths and pursued the legal case,” Hooda said.

Addressing the gathering, Hooda alleged that the BJP minister was not ready to listen to the truth and tried to silence them by using his influence through CBI and Haryana Police. The samiti announced that anyone from Jat community found having any association with the minster would also face a similar ban.

File photo of Captain Abhimanyu

CHANDIGARH: A day after finance minister Capt Abhimanyu accused ex-CM Bhupinder Hooda and his men of targeting his family, HPCC chief Ashok Tanwar said on Sunday that the persons who attacked him in New Delhi appeared to be the same who are now accused of vandalism at finance minister Captain Abhimanyu’s house during the Jat stir in February 2016.

The finance minister, in an exclusive interview to TOI, had categorically said that his house and family were targeted by the people connected to Hooda and not activists involved in the Jat reservation movement.

Speaking to TOI, Tanwar reiterated, “On Saturday, while I was in Samalkha, some of our supporters showed me the statements made by Capt Abhimanyu and details provided by him. Our supporters said that the accused were the same who had attacked me and other Congressmen in New Delhi,” he said.

“There are one year, nine months and eight days left. We are counting the delay caused by inefficient police and inefficient government. Let the Congress come to power, and we shall get everything probed,” added Tanwar.

However, he refused to comment on the in-house panel constituted by the party to look into the circumstances that led to the attack on him on October 6, 2016. Hooda’s supporters, included his personal security officer, had allegedly attacked Tanwar and his supporters ahead of a procession by Congress president Rahul Gandhi.

A couple of cases were registered on a complaint filed by Navdeep Singh Dalal, a supporter of Tanwar. Among those named in the FIR is Hooda’s personal security officer Satish Rathi.

Meanwhile, Krishan Murti Hooda, a known supporter of Hooda, flayed Capt Abhimanyu for suggesting that vandals were linked to the ex-CM. Interestingly, Murti’s son Gaurav Hooda too has been named as an accused by the CBI in the chargesheet filed in the case of violence at the minister’s house.

Earlier this month, CBI had submitted chargesheet against 51 persons, which included 10 names, allegedly linked to Hooda and his men.

Guru Nanak Nishkam Sewak Jatha Gurdwara in Lady Pit Lane and a mosque in Hardy Street, Beeston, area of Leeds ... Read More

LONDON: A 42-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of arson attacks on a mosque and a Sikh temple in English city of Leeds , police said today as they probed the incident as a hate crime .

On Wednesday, the Jamia Masjid Abu Huraira Mosque in Hardy Street, Beeston, was attacked, along with the Guru Nanak Nishkam Sewak Jatha Gurdwara in Lady Pit Lane.

The main door of the mosque in south of the city centre had been set on fire at about 3.45am (local time) on Tuesday. A few minutes later, the door of the Gurdwara was also set on fire.

The man, who was not named, was arrested at an address in the city yesterday night after fires were started at the front doors of two buildings. He remains in police custody as enquiries continue, The Guardian reported.

“We are continuing to liaise with our colleagues in the local neighbourhood policing team who are maintaining an increased presence in the area and having regular contact with key representatives from the communities affected to keep them updated and to reassure the wider community,” said Detective Inspector Richard Holmes, of Leeds District CID in a statement following the arrest.

Leeds' Racial Justice Network criticised the lack of national media coverage of the incident, saying it revealed “a lack of concern for Muslim and Sikh lives and reminds us that the terrorist label (and public outrage) is only reserved for black and brown people”.

“These attacks follow on from racist and fascist ... marches in Leeds and Manchester at the weekend and reflect a resurgence of far-right racism,” they said.

“Whilst we believe that the far right are still in the minority, there is a real need for the solidification and growth of antiracist movements. With our allies across the country, the Racial Justice Network will be a part of it.”

BENGALURU: Friday’s fire at Bellandur Lake has sparked off worry among hundreds of residents living in apartments on the periphery.

Giridhar V, a resident of Sun City Euphoria apartments, said burning grass near the lake in summer was a common sight. “It’s surprising to see grass catching fire at this time of year. If the wind was blowing in the direction of the apartment, we would have had a tough time. The authorities should ensure this doesn’t happen again,” he said.

A senior official from the urban development department said a team of officials had inspected the lake banks, and reported that the cause of the fire could be arson. “While most of the 900-acre lake has been fenced, there are still pockets which are open to trespassers. Some miscreants might have gained access to the lake banks and set the dry grass or garbage piles there on fire. Floating grass on the water body was also on fire. The government is likely to take a decision to cordon off the entire lake till the STPs under construction are completed. The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board has been directed to check the chemical levels in the lake and we expect a report on Saturday,” he added.

5000 ARMYMEN IN ACTION

By afternoon, the fire on Bellandur Lake started spreading towards the defence area nearby. Hundreds of armymen jumped into action and after several hours of operations, they managed to douse the blaze and stopped it from entering the army area.

In a statement, the defence PRO said, “There was an outbreak of fire at Bellandur Lake area around 12noon. This started spreading towards the Army area. The fire which had come up to the perimeter of the Army location has been put out due to the untiring efforts of more than 5,000 Army personnel and fire-fighting equipment of ASC College and Centre. Army personnel are still alert to prevent its spread into Army and adjoining civil area. The 5,000 Army personnel was led by Major General NS Rajpurohit , deputy commandant and chief instructor, ASC College and Centre. This immediate action resulted in effectively containing the fire...""

No relief till 2020

This is not the first time the lake has spat fire. In 2017, taking suo motu cognizance of the state of the lake following a similar fire incident in February, the National Green Tribunal ( NGT ) had come down hard on the city’s civic agencies for failing to clean up the lake.

However, the actual cleaning of the lake and its redevelopment is possible only after 2020. Officials of the high level panel constituted to chalk out a plan to rejuvenate the water body informed the NGT a few months ago that the lake can be cleaned only when sewage flow into the water body stops.

The Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) which is installing sewage treatment plants (STPs) to stop waste from entering the lake, will be able to complete these projects only by 2020.

“Desilting or cleaning work at the lake can be taken up only after 2020, when sewage flow stops. Otherwise, it would be a waste of money as the revival would cost us around Rs 500 crore. The same has been informed to the Tribunal,” said a senior BDA official.

A detailed feasibility report from the expert committee is awaited, said the officials.In February 2017 Congress leader Arun Yadav had written to the prime minister Narendra Modi, urging him for a probe into alleged involvement of chief minister’s relatives in illegal sand mining.Yadav wrote, illegal sand mining was rampant in entire state because of political protection and incidents like murder of an IPS officer and attacks on government officials were common and that majority of illegal sand mining was being carried out in home district of CM.He had also alleged that more than 1000 dumpers full of illegal sand were being mined and transported in the area.

BATHINDA: Dera Sacha Sauda follower Mohinderpal Singh Bittu of Kotkapura was on Monday produced in a Moga court by a special investigation team (SIT) probing the case of theft of a ‘bir’ from a gurdwara at Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village in June 2015 and the act of sacrilege at Bargari village in October 2015, both in Fardikot district.

Though Bittu was arrested in a 2011 case of arson and rioting in Moga and was produced in court in this regard, SIT also found his involvement in the sacrilege case at Mallke village of Moga and Bargari as well. He was sent to five-day police remand by the court. Bittu was picked up from Palampur in Himachal Pradesh on June 7.

Sources claimed that SIT had concluded that Bittu and his accomplices were allegedly involved in the theft of a ‘bir’ on June 1, 2015, pasting of a handwritten poster against some religious preachers at Bargari on September 25 and scattering of torn pages of Guru Granth Sahib near the gurdwara at Bargari on October 12 and Mallke case of sacrilege of November 4, 2015. Members of SIT, however, refused to share details of the matter.

Two brothers and one of their relatives from Mansa, who had come to Kotkapura to meet their family, were also picked up on June 8.

PUNE: The Kothrud police on Thursday booked two men for setting the house of a 55-year-old woman on fire and damaging four vehicles and a CCTV camera at the Shastrinagar slums at around 3am.

In another incident, three men vandalised at least seven vehicles at the Shikshak colony in Thergaon at around 11.15 am on Wednesday.

SS Dhotre, the sub-inspector of Kothrud police, said the Shastrinagar incident was the result of old and ongoing enmity between the two men and the woman.

“At about 3 am, the woman woke up from sleep and went to use the toilet. Taking advantage of the situation, the two suspects — one Dada Kudale and his accomplice — set her house on fire. The suspects later vandalised the vehicle that belonged to the woman’s son,” Dhotre said.

“Subsequently, they damaged two other vehicles and a CCTV camera. They also targetted a two-wheeler parked on the road before fleeing the spot,” she said.

The woman has lodged an FIR under various sections of the Indian Penal Code. “We have launched a hunt to arrest the two suspects at the earliest,” she added.

Meanwhile, in Thergaon, three men riding on a motorcycle intercepted 43-year-old Mahesh Taru and vandalised his vehicle. When Taru tried to stop them, one of the suspects threatened him with a sickle and robbed him of Rs 1,000.

The suspects then sped away on their motorcycle. The suspects vandalised at least seven three and four-wheelers on the same day.

Chandigarh: Dismissing the bail pleas of several accused involved in rioting and arson that had erupted after conviction of Dera Sacha Sauda (DSS) head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh in late August 2017 in rape cases, the Punjab and Haryana high court has held that courts cannot be lenient to those “who had threatened the very existence and majesty of law”.

Observing that “faith does not teach cruelty and violence against other human beings, rather it is used for uniting and strengthening the people at large,” the HC made it clear that terrorizing public at large is a heinous crime and should be dealt with stern hand.

HC was also of the view that if the accused were released at this stage, there were chances that they would try to influence the prime witnesses of the case.

Justice Mahabir Singh Sindhu passed these orders while dismissing a bunch of petitions seeking bail by Sital and others who are facing charges of attempt to murder, damaging public property and under the Explosive Substance Act in Mansa town of Punjab on August 25, 2017, after Gurmeet was convicted by a Panchkula court.

Allegations are that they were raising slogans “Dhan Dhan Satguru Tera Hi Aasra” and were shouting that their ‘father Sant Gurmeet’ had been convicted and lesson was to be taught for his conviction. They had set several vehicles on fire by using petrol bombs and also damaged buildings.

“The petitioners had a very desperate idea to destabilize the society on account of conviction of Dera chief and to put an extreme pressure on the government and the court to release the convict in a rape case. Meaning thereby, the petitioners have no respect for court of law and thus, when they have threatened the very existence and majesty of the law, then there is no occasion for this court to take an undue lenient view in their favour; rather they deserve no concession for releasing on bail,” observed Justice Sindhu while dismissing their bail petitions.

HC, however, directed the trial court to examine the complainants in the case as early as possible in view of the fact that they have taken the risk to come forward against the present petitioners.

The court also directed the Punjab police to take due care of the life and liberty of complainants as well as their families considering the sensitivity of the case.

Petitioners were seeking bail on the ground that they are in custody since long, investigation has been completed and charges have been framed against them and nothing is to be recovered from them. It was also contended that the petitioners were not named in the FIR as they were alleged to be with muffled faces and were booked four days after the FIR.

Objecting to their plea, the state government submitted that the petitioners have threatened the very existence of the court of law by their action. Actually, two cars were put on fire by the petitioners and they also entered in the office of Income Tax thereby throwing the petrol bottles, match boxes and baseball bats and created an absolute terror in the city.

Eighteen youths were held for attack on a Roadways bus and a school bus in Bhondsi

GURUGRAM: Residents of Bhondsi organised a mahapanchayat at 11am on Sunday to demand the release of those youth from their village who have been apprehended for arson and vandalism — including setting a Roadways bus on fire and attacking a school bus carrying children — as part of their agitation against the makers of film Padmaavat.

On January 24, around 18 youths from Bhondsi were apprehended by Gurgoan police, of which two juveniles have been acquitted since then. On Sunday, villager Sanjay Raghav said, “It’s unfair that instead of catching the hooligans who posed a threat to the villagers as well, cops framed our innocent children.”

The villagers have been saying the apprehended youth, who were picked up by police, were returning from tuition or sports practice, or were mere spectators to the vandalism.

“If cops have any evidence against them, they should show it to everyone. They have nothing against our children. Once tainted with a police record, the youths’ future will be spoiled,” said Pradeep .

The parents of those apprehended have threatened to start an agitation if the youth are not released. They have decided to meet deputy commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh and police commissioner Sandeep Khirwar on Monday, seeking their intervention in the matter. The villagers have already met the chief minister on January 31, but have not received any assurance from him.

“We want an impartial probe in the matter. We seek justice from these officials and hope they will find the actual culprits,” said Bishan Singh.

Panchkula: A fortnight after violence erupted following the court verdict against Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, many residents whose vehicles, belongings and household items were damaged are still running from pillar to post to complete the formalities related to their cases and claims.

The victims are having a tough time in formalities like police reports on forms that will enable them to get back their property or taking reports from the cops.

Police had taken into custody goods and vehicles or moveable properties damaged by the rioters in the violence. Since these have become case properties, individuals have to follow the procedure of “supurdari” to get them released.

At least dozen such victims could be seen running from one desk to another of lawyers and to Sector 5 police station to get the process completed recently.

“Police have completed its work by registering the case. Now, they don’t have available manpower for reporting the queries made by magistrate for release of belonging or vehicle,’’ said a resident of Sector 4 whose car was damaged.

A vendor, whose two-wheeler was damaged, said, “We know there is a procedure, but the way they have announced compensation, they should have first created a system for completion of formalities,’’ he said.

Panchkula DCP Manbir Singh assured to set up a special help desk at the Sector 5 police station. “We have just come to know about this problem. We shall start a special help desk for these victims and they shall not have any kind of problem in completion of police formalities,’’ he said.

Nidhi Bansal, secretary, District Legal Services Authority, said she has directed para legal volunteers and front office team to help the victims. “We are always there for help. Our volunteers will help them in getting the forms related to supurdari and release orders of the vehicles or belongings,’’ she said.

What is supurdari

According to rules, “supurdari” is getting possession of goods from a police station. The victim has to approach the ilaqa magistrate who asks the SHO of a police station for the report. After the SHO gives its report, the magistrate issues the release order after getting a surety bond.

Chandigarh: The Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI ) has intensified its probe into the violence and arson at the residential and official premises of Haryana finance minister Captain Abhimanyu in Rohtak during the Jat agitation for reservation in February 2016.

According to information, a team of CBI headed by an additional superintendent of police (ASP) is camping in the faculty house of Maharishi Dayanand University (MDU), Rohtak and has served notices to 50 persons asking them to join investigations.

Sources said that 10 out of 50 are from villages near MDU campus and the industrial area of Rohtak and they have been named as accused in the matter.

Haryana Police had arrested 42 persons, including Sudeep Kalkal and Manoj Duhan, for setting properties of Abhimanyu’s family on fire. Both Kalkal and Duhan are among 10 persons lodged in the Ambala jail and the others were granted bailed by a rohtak court before the case was transferred to the CBI court in Panchkula.

Unwilling to share the identity of persons, who have been served notices to join investigations, CBI officials said they include those who were on bail and some others too, including close aides of senior political leaders of the district and state.

Sources said that a Haryana police official, who had been part of the special investigation team (SIT) in initial stages, has been attached with the CBI team for assistance. In February 2017, CBI had taken over the probe in the matter and registered fresh FIRs in its office at Chandigarh. Since then the agency is working to file a chargesheet in the case.

MADURAI: Lambasting police and a subordinate court for letting go Scott-free the authors of Dinakaran newspaper office arson case, that left three people dead in 2007, Madras high court reversed an order of acquittal and sentenced nine people to life imprisonment on Thursday. The convicts include 'Attack' Pandi, a former aide of ousted DMK leader M K Alagiri, and deputy superintendent of police Rajaram. However, in the case of the latter the court would disclose the quantum of jail term on March 25.

The court further directed the Tamil Nadu government to pay a compensation of Rs 5 lakh each to the families of the bereaved within a period of three months.

Citing that the trial court acquitted all the accused because almost every witness turned hostile, a division bench of justice P N Prakash and justice B Pugalendhi said it was unfortunate that the trial court had abdicated its judicial responsibility to seek the truth and, instead, deployed a specious line of reasoning to arrive at a verdict of acquittal.

“If a witness becomes hostile to subvert the judicial process, the court shall not stand as a mute spectator and every effort should be made to bring home the truth. Criminal justice system cannot be overturned by those gullible witnesses who act under pressure, inducement or intimidation,” said the bench.

Dinakaran office at Madurai in 2007 was torched by vandals on May 9, 2007, after it published the results of an opinion poll which suggested that M K Stalin had greater public approval as political successor to DMK patriarch M Karunanidhi than his elder brother M K Alagiri. Three Dinakaran staff members -- Vinoth Kumar, Gopinath and Muthuramalingam -- were killed in the incident. The case was later taken over by the CBI, which booked 17 people, including the then DSP Rajaram, for facilitating the attack.

On December 9, 2009, the trial court acquitted the accused of all charges, as key witnesses turned hostile. In all, of the 83 prosecution witnesses 49 turned hostile. It included 21 police personnel and 15 witnesses from the press, including colleagues of the deceased.

Calling the bluff of the prosecution, the bench headed by justice Prakash said there could be no greater affront to administration of justice than erroneous acquittals in criminal cases resulting from witnesses turning hostile. “The very edifice of the criminal law is compromised when the enforcement machinery of the State is subverted and the perpetrators of crime walk out Scott-free,” the bench stated.

As ‘Attack’ Pandi is already in Palayamkottai prison, serving time in connection with another case, the court directed the other accused -- Prabhu, Vijaya Pandi, P Kandasamy, G Ramaiah Pandian, V Sudhakar, Thirumurugan @ Kattuvasi Murugan, I Ruban and Malik Batcha -- to be secured.

The court set aside the acquittal of the DSP Rajaram and convicted him for lesser offences under Sections 217 (public servant disobeying law to save person from punishment) and 221 (intentionally omits to apprehend a suspect) of IPC. It directed Rajaram to appear before the court on March 25 to decide on quantum of his sentence.

AHMEDABAD: As part of the internal probe into the rioting and arson on January 23 that took place in protest against the release of the film , Padmaavat , six more persons were arrested but later released on bail by Satellite police.

Rajendrasinh Vaghela alias Rajbha was brought back to the same lock-up in the police station from where he had managed to leave on January 23. An armed guard has also been posted outside the lock-up, said officials. Rajbha is on one-day remand with Satellite police in the rioting case.

“As part of the inquiry which has been initiated into the incident (Rajbha was allowed to leave even when he was apprehended as one of the accused in rioting case), statements of 25 constables and ASIs are being recorded to ascertain what had happened on the night of January 23. The policemen have been identified on the basis of CCTV footage of that day,” said a police official.

Lalsinh Masani, one of the three constables suspended over the incident, has passed the departmental examination to become a sub-inspector. However, with the inquiry headed by ACP, Andrews Mackwan, his appointment now looks uncertain.

The incident has so far resulted in suspension of four policemen – three of Satellite and one of Sanand police station. The violence on January 23 resulted in damage to over 200 vehicles at six locations in Ahmedabad and damage to over 20 commercial establishments. For two hours, protesters had run amok in the city.

MUMBAI: In view of the violence that marred the bandh called in other parts of Maharashtra on Tuesday, Maratha groups have appealed to the community to observe Wednesday's bandh in the city in a peaceful manner. Vinod Patil, one of the Maratha Kranti Morcha's conveyors who attended its meeting held in Dadar to finalize the bandh call, said, ""We do not want to disrupt the life of common people."" He added the group's agitation will continue in other parts of the state.

Mumbai police have said they will be alert and deploy an adequate number of personnel. A senior police officer said, ""We will be deploying cops from police stations and platoons of the State Reserve Police Force."" Quick Response Team commandos and Home Guards too will be called in if required, the officer said.

Taxi union leader A L Quadros said he has not taken any decision to support the bandh but said the decision on plying would be taken depending on the situation in the morning. ""If there is risk of driving and fear of being attacked, cabbies will stay off roads,"" he said. Auto union leader Shashank Rao said they were not supporting the bandh and rickshaws would ply unless there was violence and attacks on drivers/autos.

The state's announcement of a mega recruitment for 72,000 government jobs sparked the fresh round of agitation. Marathas are demanding the government reserve 16% jobs in this drive for the community, and leaders of all parties, including BJP, support the demand. But with the decision on quota pending in court, the community is not sure of the validity of the reservation and wants the government to postpone recruitment till the court's verdict is in.

Asked about the state's appeals for discussions on the issue, Patil said, ""Our demands have not changed, so there is no need to discuss the issue again.""

On the agitation turning violent, one convenor said, ""This is anger against the government for not keeping its promises, and it escalated after a farmer participating in the agitation in Aurangabad was washed away on Monday.""

The Shiv Sena has said the report of the Maharashtra State Commission for Backward Classes cannot be prepared in haste as it has to stand up to legal scrutiny. ""The previous Rane panel report was scrapped by courts. The committee established by our government will have to make a sound report so the stay on quota can be vacated,"" said Sena minister Subhash Desai. ""The previous government that gave assurances without doing its homework should be held responsible for the mess today,"" he added. The commission is currently holding public hearings. It will study data on the Maratha community's representation.

BHU students’ face-off with police continued till 3am on Sunday.

VARANASI: Tension prevailed on the BHU campus on Sunday even as the city witnessed protests and minor skirmishes after a night of violence and arson over the issue of eve-teasing. Except for minor scuffles between police and a group of students trying to take out a peace march, no other untoward incident took place on the campus. The university administration has advanced the puja holidays from September 28 to 25. The campus will now be opened on October 3.

LIVE: Protests turn violent in BHU

On Saturday night, protests against the alleged sexual harassment of a student took a violent turn on the campus when seven students, including girls, and two journalists were injured in lathicharge. Police were able to bring the situation under control only by 3 am on Sunday . Tension prevailed on the campus through the day , forcing the university administration to advance the puja holidays from September 28 to 25. The campus will now be opened on October 3.

The protesting students were trying to enter the vicechancellor's house on Saturday night when they were caned.

In retaliation, students reportedly hurled petrol bombs and resorted to brick-batting in which some policemen were injured. Violence erupted at BHU hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi left his Lok Sabha constituency after a two-day visit. Taking cognizance of the violence, CM Aditya Nath Yogi has sought a report from divisional commissioner Nitin Gokarn. With the campus under the shadow of over 1,500 securitymen on Sunday, frantic political activity took place outside with former student union leaders, academics and employees taking out an all-party march. UP Congress Committee chief Raj Babbar and former Congress MP PL Punia were detained while trying to reach the campus, but were released later. Security forces staged a flag march late Sunday evening.

The district administration also announced that other universities, including Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapeeth, Sampurnanand Sanskrit University and colleges affiliated to them, would remain closed till October 2.

Trouble started in BHU on the night of September 21 when students of a girls' hostel sat on protest following the sexual harassment of a student of visual arts near Bharat Kala Bhawan.

The girl was harassed by three boys on a motorcycle while she was returning to her hostel in Triveni complex and students alleged that campus security guards who were standing just 100 metres from the spot didn't react.

The victim said her war den, instead of taking up the issue, asked her why she was returning to her hostel late.The warden's response angered the fellow inmates, who sat on a `dharna' after Thursday. In all, three FIRs had been lodged by the BHU administration--first for the sexual harassment of the girl student on September 21 evening, second for the violence on the campus and the third for display of provocative photograph on a Facebook page `BHU Buzz' that was used for live streaming of violence on Saturday night.

The students who sat on a dharna after September 21 midnight continued their protests at the women's college on September 22, the day Modi landed in the city . This forced the administration to change the route of PM's convoy which was to cross the area to visit the Durga Kund temple on Friday evening.

The sit-in continued throughout Saturday. A heavy posse of security forces stationed on the campus gate didn't allow the protesters to come out as the PM was in town.

However, violence erupted on Saturday night when a group of girl students accompanied by some boys tried to enter the V-C's house to meet him.

The security guards of the university stopped them and the police were informed.BHU administration said subsequently , there was stone-pelting by `outsiders' who had joined the students.

BHU later issued a statement saying the 'dharna' by the students just a day before the PM's visit was `politically motivated' to malign the image of the university.

DM Yogeshwar Ram Mishra and SSP RK Bhardwaj said that police had to resort to lathicharge to bring the situation under control.

NAGPUR: The fire in under construction restaurant in JP Square , the six-storey commercial complex at Law College Square , on Sunday night was case of arson, the police said. Sitabuldi police have registered an offence against four unidentified persons under Section 436 of IPC (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy property) on the basis of CCTVs footage. It is probably a first-of-its-kind case in the city.

PSI Nitin Vitole from Sitabuldi police station told TOI footage from nearby cameras show four youths entering the building and coming out 36 minutes later. “We collected footages of CCTVs installed by Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) at Law College square and on two buildings behind the petrol pump and adjacent to JP square building. Youths entered the building from West High Court (WHC) road gate at 1.35am. They came out again from the same gate at 2.11am and fled,” he said.

Vitole added the owner of the bar and restaurant Arjun Jitendrapalsingh Chhabra had lodged complaint alleging fire was mischief on Monday. “Chhabra in his complaint said there was no power connection and no one were present on the fourth floor. He himself had locked the floor around 6.30pm on Sunday. Further details can be known once the four are identified,” he said.

TOI is having the CCTVs footage in its possession. It shows five youths entering the building. It has two gates- one on Amravati road and other on WHC road. Two youths walked from Amravati road and jumped over the gate at 1.35am. Two minutes later, three more youths came and did the same. On coming out, four of them ran towards Times Square on WHC road. The fifth youth wasn’t with them. It is believed he might have gone from Amravati road gate where there is no CCTV coverage.

There are two entrances into the building. One is from front while other one is fire staircase from rear side. It is not clear which one the youths took. Sitabuldi police said two plastic drums smelling of some fuel were also found from fourth floor. While entering the building, the youths had nothing in their hands.

Laxmi Nagar resident Chhabra (26) told TOI he had no enmity with anyone so no suspecion over any person. “We had no insurance. I with my partner- Pawan Nirbhan- were about to start the bar and restaurant in the next few days. Labourers of contractors used to stay there but on Sunday none was there,” he said.

Another incident was reported from Mankapur village near Banur in Mohali district where an attempt was made to set a local school on fire. In the third incident, which was reported from Handiaya in Barnala, some miscreants pelted stones on a sewa kendra.

Curfew was imposed in Sangrur district from 8 pm onwards on Friday. Five persons were arrested in in Dirba area of Sangrur after they rammed their vehicle into a police car. They are said to be dera followers and were allegedly on their way to set a petrol pump on fire. Iron rods, petrol and wooden sticks were recovered from their possession.

Dera followers also blocked the Delhi-Ludhiana national highway at Dirba, but the blockade was lifted soon. An attempt was made to set up a power house in Khandewad village in Sangrur district on Fire but it was foiled.

Rai said in all three incidents, no major damage was reported. While at Lehragaga an office table was set ablaze, a window pane was shattered in the stone pelting incident at Handiaya. Besides, a bid to set fire to a telephone exchange in Sular village in Sangrur district was also foiled.

He said three FIRs under the Punjab Prevention of Damage to Public and Private Property Act of 2014 had been registered and efforts were being made to identify the accused. He said as per the provisions of the Act any damaged caused to the public and private property would be recovered from the accused.

He said the security agencies and the intelligence wing of the police department were keeping a close watch on any related developments and assured that no one would be allowed to disrupt the law and order situation in the state.

Meanwhile, a complete restriction on movement of any traffic on roads leading to the private residence of CM Amarinder Singh, the New Moti Bagh Palace, had been put into effect on Friday morning.

The markets and work places across Ropar, Fatehgarh Sahib, Patiala and Sangrur district wore a deserted look with the locals staying away from roads.

Thirty vehicles were torched in a slum on July 9 (File photo)

PUNE: Since the year began, as many as 26 cases of arson were registered in the city. Police data revealed that youngsters were involved in most of the cases, among which seven happened to be minors.

On July 9, around 28 vehicles were torched in a Parvati slum making it the most grave incident since January, besides similar cases of vehicles being set ablaze in the city.

According to the data, maximum number of cases have been registered under Sangvi police station, while Division IV remained the most notorious area (see box) where such cases were registered in almost all police stations.

As per senior police officials, such acts were mostly committed by people under the influence of alcohol. While police admits that it is difficult to prevent such crimes, their frequent occurrence has exposed the vulnerability of lakhs of vehicles parked along the roadside every night.

The CCTV surveillance network has helped the police solve most of these cases this year. Police arrested seven juveniles involved in the crime, while three of the accused are already behind the bars.

Among the arrested persons, most turned out to be youngsters, said Deepak Sakore, deputy commissioner of police in-charge of Zone IV. “The crimes are motivated by revenge or rivalry. But, if one vehicle catches fire, all those in the vicinity are brought into its fold. Interestingly, we have not seen any repeat offenders of such crimes,” he said, explaining that most cases have been reported from congested residential colonies of middle-class and lower middle-class families.

Police commissioner Rashmi Shukla has appealed the citizens to share information and leads to unravel the pending cases too. “We are trying out some strategies to prevent such offences. However, citizens must come forward to report any information that they may be related to the crimes,” she said.

Captain Abhimanyu

CHANDIGARH: The Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI ) has intensified its probe into the violence and arson at the residential and official premises of Haryana finance minister Captain Abhimanyu in Rohtak during the Jat agitation for reservation in February 2016.

According to information, a team of CBI headed by an additional superintendent of police (ASP) is camping in the faculty house of Maharishi Dayanand University (MDU), Rohtak and has served notices to 50 persons asking them to join investigations.

Sources said that 10 out of 50 are from villages near MDU campus and the industrial area of Rohtak and they have been named as accused in the matter.

Haryana Police had arrested 42 persons, including Sudeep Kalkal and Manoj Duhan, for setting properties of Abhimanyu’s family on fire.

Both Kalkal and Duhan are among 10 persons lodged in the Ambala jail and the others were granted bailed by a rohtak court before the case was transferred to the CBI court in Panchkula.

Unwilling to share the identity of persons, who have been served notices to join investigations, CBI officials said they include those who were on bail and some others too, including close aides of senior political leaders of the district and state.

Sources said that a Haryana police official, who had been part of the special investigation team (SIT) in initial stages, has been attached with the CBI team for assistance. In February 2017, CBI had taken over the probe in the matter and registered fresh FIRs in its office at Chandigarh.

INDORE: Mandsaur police has identified more than 30 drug smugglers who indulged in violence and arson during the farmers’ violence seen in the district during the first week of June.Mandsaur superintendent of police Manoj Kumar Singh has announced a reward of Rs 5000 each on the heads of as many as 32 persons for violence during the agitation on June 6 and 7. All of them have a history of drug smuggling in the opium rich district Madhya Pradesh.“We sifted through video grabs from various sources and have identified 30-32 drug smugglers who indulged in violence under the garb of farmers’ agitation,” Singh told TOI.Every person thus identified had been booked in the past under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. Their photographs are in police records.“We have arrested around four persons. The rest seem to have fled the district. We have launched a manhunt,” the SP said.Violence broke out in Mandsaur leading to deaths of six persons, five of them in firing in Pipliamandi. The agitated crowd had set afire as many as 30 vehicles, besides torching four shops and two factories. The violent mob had looted liquor shops and toll collection booth at Pipliamandi.Police had arrested over 100 persons in connection to violence and had launched a full-scale investigation into it, once normalcy returned to the district.The police sniffed the role of smugglers in violence when it came to fore that one of those killed in firing at Pipliamandi had four cases registered against him under NDPS Act and was evading police.Mandsaur district produces two-thirds of country’s opium under the watchful eyes of authorities. The bumper crop of opium has often provided raw material for drug smugglers, who have been operational in the region and have been caught by the police in the past.The move by the police gave a new dimension to the cause of violence in the area, raising speculations if the violence during farmers’ protest was stage-managed.Former Mandsaur district collector Swantra Kumar Singh was also manhandled by a crowd and made to run to safety on the violence stretch of Neemuch highway on June 6. Police have booked around 40 persons in connection to the attack.“We have identified 4-5 persons and named them in the FIR filed regarding the attack on the former collector. We will trace them soon,” Singh said."

KALYAN: After farmers' protests over Nevali village land row turned violent last week, the Thane police is set to use drone cameras for surveillance in the affected villages to avert further problems and also to trace those who indulged in violence and arson .

Sunil Bhardwaj, deputy commissioner of police, zone 4 of Thane police, said, ""We are going to use drone cameras in Nevali and other nearby villages to keep surveillance and also to trace the suspects hiding there.” Explaining the need for drone camera, the police said whenever their teams visit the villages, the locals inform the suspects and help them escape.

On Thursday, farmers staged a protest as they were unhappy with defence ministry's move to take over 1,600 acres of land at Nevali village in Kalyan and Ambernath talukas of Thane district for a defence airport requisitioned during World War II. The protest turned violent as they set 10 vehicles on fire. Over 25 people were injured.

The police have prepared a list of 135 accused who injured 12 policemen and damaged property worth Rs 1.55 crore. The police said out of the 135, they have arrested 30. This includes 10 villagers arrested on Monday — nine of them arrested by Manpada police in Dombivli while one person was arrested by Hill Line police. The police are planning to invoke stringent charges against those who used petrol bombs and bamboos and pelted stones ayt police.

Meanwhile, as a result of the constant surveillance, the villagers are scared of police ire. A resident from Bhal village said, ""In the name of arresting suspects, police are harassing villagers. Now everybody is scared that police may falsely implicate anybody to take revenge of the attack on their personnel.”

CHANDIGARH: Even over 15 months after violence and arson gripped Haryana during the February 2016 proquota Jat stir , over 163 weapons and ammunition looted by rioters, are yet to be recovered.

These weapons were stolen, snatched or looted during the violence, in which 31 people were killed and public and private property worth crores of rupees was damaged.

Security experts and retired police officers are of the view that not only could such a large number of arms and ammunition be misused for anti-social activities, but their non-recovery after such a long period reflects poorly on the police force.

The data on weapons not yet recovered by cops was recently submitted before Justice S N Jha panel, which is probing the conspiracy angle in the violence.

According to the data, in Rohtak alone -the epicenter of the agitation -around 104 weapons of private persons deposited at Meham police station and a local gun house were looted and are yet to be recovered. These weapons include single and do uble-barrel guns, pistols and revolvers. Surprisingly, three .

303 rifles along with 75 rounds, looted from the police guard room outside finance minister Captain Abhimanyu's residence, have also not been traced by the police. This, despite the arrest of 40 persons in cases related to attack on the minister's residence.

Around 53 weapons, including 31 private ones, 19 case property and 3 official arms, looted from Jind district's Pillu Khera police station, too have not been recovered till date. Even the tear grenades, pistols and shells that were snatched from the state police at national highway-1, near Larsauli village in Sonipat district, as violence spiralled, are yet to be found. Police also have no clues on the the 2300 missing cartridges.

Retired Inspector General of Police (IGP) Ranbir Sharma, said non-recovery of such a huge cache of ammunition even after more than a year of investigation and identification of several accused, reflects the insensitivity of the police and the state government. “It also shows that the police and authorities are not serious about recovery of weapons, which could be misused by anti-social elements,“ he added.

Former director general of police (DGP), M S Malik said such arms are likely to be used by criminals.“Since these are legally purchased sophisticated guns and pistols of private individuals deposited at gun houses or police stations, such weaponry is serious threat to social security of the state.""

CHENNAI: Protests erupted at Sathyabama University on Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR) on Wednesday night after an 18-year-old first year computer science student committed suicide in her hostel after being caught copying in an exam, police said. After dinner, as the news spread, several students torched furniture at the college and the hostel. A police team conducted an inquiry but no one was arrested.Police identified the deceased as Duvvuru Monica Reddy of Andhra Pradesh and said she was writing the chemistry paper in her semester exam when she was found copying. The invigilator informed other officials and she was asked to leave the hall,” a police officer said.A university official told TOI that the girl was caught copying from a 10x12 paper. The usual consequence of such examination-related malpractice is that the student would be debarred for one examination and the family intimated. The girl went back to her hostel, and apparently sent an SMS to her twin Rakesh who was also writing the examination in the same hall.Her brother saw the text message only after the examination, rushed to her hostel and requested her friends to check her room. Monica Reddy was found hanging and rushed to hospital, where she was declared dead.The university official said there was no unrest on campus till dinner time and that students had taken their food and evening snacks in the mess without any trouble. It is not clear if the death has any direct link to the late evening campus unrest and arson committed by students, he said, adding that university authorities would think about future course of action, including declaring leave, by Thursday.The parents of the victim are on their way from Hyderabad, police said.After this incident, the university has postponed the pending exams to January, 2018. Also, originally the holidays were scheduled from December 2 to January 2 but now, they have declared the holidays from today till January 2.In Video: Girl commits suicide, fellow students set college library on fire"

Shocked and angry

Too many security lapses

No false promises, please

Students tweet to PM and CM

Government Medical College is in news again, for all the wrong reasons. Recently, an unidentified miscreant set a couple of bikes ablaze at girls’ hostels in the wee hours. This is second such incident within a year. But it seems the authorities have not learnt their lesson. The arson attack, captured on the CCTV camera, has not only instilled immense fear among the girls , it has also raised questions about college’s poor security measures. Angry students have now approached the PM to seek better security measures for themselves.Medical aspirants from all over the country vie to get a seat in GMC. But today, the students studying here are angry and scared due to such harrowing incidents happening too often on the campus premises. One of the hostel girls who is still in shock, shares, “We are so scared that none of us are able to study or sleep properly since that incident. Our parents are also quite worried about our safety. GMC is one of the leading medical institutions in the country, but it is sad to know that it is so vulnerable to such lethal attacks.”After the incident, over 200 students staged a protest in front of the dean, Dr Abhimanyu Niswade’s office. Another hostel girl requesting anonymity laments, “Enough is enough! We want our demands to be met now. We need a boundary wall immediately. What if our hostels are set on fire tomorrow? Forget an adequate number of security guards, the hostels do not even have an emergency exit.” Quite irked, she goes on to add, “When our two-wheelers were torched, the security guard was fast asleep and we had to wake him up. The girls had to douse the fire, using fire extinguishers and the guard was simply watching. I fail to understand why can’t the authorities work seriously towards beefing up the security?”It is not just the girls, who are fighting for their safety, college boys have also joined the bandwagon to support them. One of the residents of boys’ hostel says that there are many other grave issues bothering the GMC girls. He adds, “Girls being eve-teased by the outsiders on the premises has become a regular feature here. We have submitted a full report of all our problems to the dean.” To this, another student adds, “Last time too, the dean had promised to build the boundary wall and now he has promised to do it all over again, but if we do not see any development on this front, nothing will stop us from going on strike again.”Not ready to take things lying down, GMC students have now shared their woes with the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on social media. One of the hostel residents reveals, “It is important to bring this issue to their notice. Over 100 students have tweeted to both CM and PM, expressing their anger and concern. We want to expose the incompetency of the security agencies and callous attitude of the college authorities.”"

MUMBAI: Fire brigade officials suspects the recent fire at Garib Nagar in Bandra during a demolition drive was arson and not an accident. Officials are waiting for cops to complete investigation and submit a report.

Fire officials said their initial reports show the blaze was not caused by a short-circuit or a gas leak. They suspect someone set ablaze a shanty using kerosene, causing the fire to spread quickly and several cylinders in the vicinity to explode. Chief fire officer P Rahangdale said, “After an initial probe, we suspect it was not an accidental fire. Since the police are also investigating the case, we are waiting for their panchnama and other reports to conclude our report.”

A fire erupted last month while the BMC was clearing slum encroachments adjoining the Tansa water pipeline near Bandra station (E). Three firemen sustained injuries during the fire-fighting operation. The police have arrested a 29-year-old man on charges of arson. According to the police, the accused, Sadir Khan, and a few others added to the fire, which eventually engulfed around 300 hutments and left the firemen injured. Local slumlord Salim Lightwalla and his son Salman, who are accused in the case, are absconding. The duo is also accused in the Azad Maidan riots case.

The slum stands on encroached land adjoining the Bandra station foot over-bridge. Part of the land is owned by railway and portion of it is with the BMC. Civic officials said most of the shanties are illegal and around two decades ago, the BMC had removed them from the area after providing them alternate accommodation at various locations. But several returned again and constructed multistorey slum structures.

Gurgaon: For the second time in a week, a fire broke out in an Aravali forest area, this time in the Ghata area on Wednesday afternoon. It spread over nearly seven acres before it could be put out.

More than half-a-dozen fire tenders from DLF Phase 5 and Sector 29 fire stations were pressed into service. The fire was doused after two hours.

On April 14, a fire was reported in Aravali forest at Titdali village near Badshapur. The affected area is part of the Aravali foothills covered with tall grass and old trees, and marked in land revenue records as ‘gair mumkin pahar' and ‘bhood', earmarked for a potential NCZ. The land is owned by a developer.

Although authorities were unable to pinpoint the cause of the fire, sources said it could have been man-made. ""The fire could have been lit by someone to clear the greenery, as getting permission to cut trees here is difficult,"" said a source, adding the ""arsonist"" could have been driven by the hope this would lead to faster clearance for the NCZ project.

The department of town and country planning is currently processing the NCZ proposal.

During a visit to Gurgaon last week, DTCP additional chief secretary P Raghvendra Rao had said, ""The district-level committee has submitted its report. We'll finalise the NCZ soon.""

The chief conservator of forest (Gurgaon circle) M D Sinha, said the affected area does not come under his department's jurisdiction. ""Even though the land is privately owned, forest personnel reached the spot and helped douse the fire,"" he said.

He dismissed possibility of short circuit, saying there is no high tension wire passing through the area. ""It's difficult to say what caused the fire,"" said Sinha.

Firefighter Pawan Kumar said the hilly terrain posed some challenges before they could douse the fire.

CHENNAI: As Cauvery sentiments simmered, there was some semblance of calm in Tamil Nadu on Tuesday with just sporadic reports of unrest and arson. While undercurrent of tension remained in some parts of the state, members of fringe Tamil groups targeted Karnataka registration vehicles and establishments.

In Sriperumbudur near Chennai, a mob attacked and torched a truck bearing Karnataka registration. Villagers doused the flames throwing buckets of water and sand. Police stepped up security for Karnataka-based establishments as minor incidents of stone throwing at buses and ATMs continued. Police provided protection to residences of actors Rajnikant, Prabhu Deva, Prakash Raj and Arjun in Chennai.

A private bus carrying 11 passengers and proceeding from Koyambedu towards Bengaluru were intercepted by two men on a motorbike. They were later arrested. On Tuesday morning, seven people entered a Karnataka-based hotel 'Sangeetha' situated in Gandhi Nagar in Velachery and raised slogans condemning the attack on Tamils in Bengaluru. They allegedly damaged window panes by hurling stones.

Some men torched a truck bearing Karnataka registration in Karur at midnight of Monday. Fearing further violence, police strengthened security in front of Karnataka banks and the state bank of Mysore in many places in the central region.

A coffee powder shop at Kaveri Nagar in Thanjavur was ransacked by miscreants on Tuesday. The shop was a franchise of a coffee manufacturing unit said to be owned by a senior political leader of Karnataka.

With the Cauvery row making it difficult for trucks carrying vegetables from Tamil Nadu to enter Karnataka, the TN government decided to procure the produce from farmers of Krishnagiri and Dharmapuri and sell the goods in farm fresh outlets.

About 12 metric tonnes of vegetables were procured from farmers on Tuesday, said an official statement. The vegetables from Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri would be sold in 64 farm fresh outlets in Chennai, Trichy, Madurai, and Coimbatore districts. These outlets are run by Kamadhenu, Chintamani, Kancheepuram, and North Madras Cooperative stores, and TN civil supplies corporation.

BENGALURU: Tension prevailed in the villages around Darshankuli forest , where a Doddalahalli youth was killed on Thursday. Forest officials said that Gurumurthy Siddaiah alias Guru was a poacher, who died after being hit by a bullet fired by one of his associates. However, villagers alleged it was an encounter, and took to attacking forest and police department vehicles, even indulging in arson.

The villagers said that Guru was a farmer, and not a poacher. “His mother Thayamma is a milk farmner, and owns many cows. One of them didn’t return home on Wednesday. So Guru and three of his friends went into the forest in search of the cow,” said Mahesh Guraiah, a Doddalahalli resident.

However, Guraiah said that he did not know anything about Guru’s friends. News of Guru’s death spread like wildfire and by noon, hundreds of villagers descended on Uyamballi, on the periphery of Darshakakuli forest. The presence of cops notwithstanding, the villagers raised slogans against forest officials. A group of men even tried to upend a police jeep, but senior officials prevented them.

The mob of villagers demanded that forest officials who fired at Guru be handed over to them. Later, the villagers refused to allow Guru’s body to be taken for autopsy until the government announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh.

Meanwhile, some miscreants set vehicles parked outside the forest office on fire, and hurled stones at the windows. The front portion of the office was gutted by the fire.

Ramanagara SP Ramesh Banoth , along with the forest officials succeeded in pacifying the mob. “We told them compensation was not in our hands. We can recommend it if it is found that the deceased youth was not a poacher, and the forest officials are proven wrong,” a senior forest official said.

Hardik Patel

AHMEDABAD: Patidar quota stir leader Hardik Patel on Tuesday sought anticipatory bail from the city sessions court in connection with the FIR lodged with Ramol police on charges of rioting and arson against him and 59 other agitators.

As the probe has been transferred to the city crime branch, Patel, on Monday, went along with 12 other supporters to surrender in this case. However, he was not arrested because the investigating officer was out of station. In his bail plea filed through advocate Rafik Lokhandwala, Patel has contended that police does not want to arrest him at present, but he fears that he could be arrested at a crucial time when he undertakes a movement. It has also been contended that if he is arrested now, he may go to an appropriate court for bail proceedings. But since, police seem intent on disrupting his future programme, they may apprehend him. The court issued notice to the investigating officer and kept March 31 for hearing on the anticipatory bail plea.

JAIPUR: The Banjaras of Dhikola in Bhilwara district heaved a sigh of relief as the sessions court in Shahpura refused to allow the government to withdraw the FIR registered in the August 2014 case of arson against a mob that attacked the homes of 42 Banjara families in Dhikola, Bhilwara district. On November 23 last year, the principal secretary in the home department of the state government had sought that in “public interest”, this FIR be withdrawn. Activists were riled, and questioned whose “interests” the government upheld –of victims or perpetrators of crime.

On August 19, 2014, in an unprovoked attack, a mob armed with sharp weapons poured kerosene on the possessions and homes of 42 families of the traditionally nomadic Banjara community at Dhikola in Shahpura gram panchayat of Bhilwara district. Motorcycles and tractors were reduced to cinders and homes turned into ash. The FIR was registered under sections pertaining to rioting and carrying deadly weapons. There were 141 accused and 46 were arrested.

On Friday, arguing against the withdrawal of the FIR by the government, Suresh Srimali , lawyer of the Banjaras, said the charges were grave. Withdrawal of the FIR would be a bolt to the justice delivery mechanism of the state, he said. The court refused to allow the government to withdraw FIR and posted the matter for hearing on August 4.

Paras Banjara, the only graduate from the community, said this represented a victory for his people. “Despite our urging, the government refused to review its decision to withdraw the FIR. We are glad the court listened to our plea. The Banjaras are a people with faith in the Constitution and the judiciary. We will continue to struggle for justice.”

Racism and hate crime are becoming an increasingly common occurrence for di asporic communities and ethnic minorities living in the US of late. Attacks on houses of worship after the elevation of Donald Trump as US president are adding to the tension among the Punjabi diaspora. To combat this, the Sikh Coalition has brought out some guidelines on `Preventing Attacks on Gurdwaras'.

The steps in the `Gurdwara Security Toolkit' which are being distributed to gurdwaras around the US, and can also be downloaded online. These include keeping a `Clean House', ensuring no rubbish or leaves are left around the gurdwara as fuel for arsonists. A voluntary Community Arson Watch Programme is also encouraged, alongside establishing links with the police and fire department. Indeed, steps to combat arson such as installing sprinklers, smoke alarms, lights, and locks are extensively covered due to an average of 103 arson fires per year being reported in 2000-2015 at houses of worship. Less than 2% were initially investigated as hate crimes.

The guidelines also outline a number of potential types of attacks houses of worship could encounter; shootersmall arms attack involving hostages, vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices, arson, sabotage theftvandalism, chemicalbiologi calradiological attacks.

Potential indicators of attack are also listed, such as someone wearing bulky clothing, or people asking excessive questions regarding the tem ple's practices or infrastructure. Protective measures are discussed thoroughly, and instructions on how to respond should a shooter be in the vicinity are provided. Tips on how and where to run and hide are given as steps 1 and 2, and step 3 which is fight, suggested as the last resort.

Aasees Kaur of the Sikh Coalition explains why now seemed the right time for this initiative. “Five years ago, the Sikh community in America witnessed the Oak Creek tragedy.Since then, as hate crime has continued against Sikhs, we have also witnessed a significant spike in hate crime against minority communities over the past year. There are many reports of vandalism, arson, bomb threats, and mass shootings targeting places of worship. While we refuse to live in fear, we do not want to see our gurdwaras vandalized or attacked. Our goal with this project is to take appropriate measures to protect and defend our places of worship, communities and children“.

She stresses that Tracking these guidelines adDiasp dress both gurdwara committee members and the Sangat.“Gurdwara committees have a duty to take preventative measures to better protect their congregation and the local Sangat feel it's right to encourage their committee members to commit to this programme if they have not done so already . It's great to see this happening with this project“.

So far, the vast majority of gurdwaras have responded positively, and the Sikh Coalition has connected them with local federal security experts, who in turn have been getting to know the community members. While this is limited to the US as yet, Kaur feels that this kind of initiative may find its way into other Punjabi diaspora communities in the UK or Canada.

ROHTAK: Two accused Ajay and Sachin, who were booked for arson and looting a Woodland showroom and a liquor vend in Rohtak during 2016 February violence were acquitted by a local court on Friday for want of evidence. It was on the complaint of Kunal, manager of Woodland showroom at D-park in Rohtak, that a case was registered on February 25, 2016, under sections 436, 392, 148 and 149 of the IPC.

The complainant had stated that many persons armed with sharp-edged weapons and sticks had barged into the showroom on February 19 and looted footwear worth Rs 46 lakh and garments and accessories worth more than Rs 1.05 crore. They also torched furniture causing losses of Rs 40 lakh before fleeing.

Another FIR was registered on the same day by a Model Town chowki constable that the looted items had been stored in a shop near D-park. When the police raided it in the presence of the shop owner, they recovered Woodland apparels and liquor bottles from there. Shop owner Surender had claimed that he had rented the shop to Ajay and his friend Manjeet Yadav for four months and suspected their role in this.

Manjeet turned out to be a son of a personal security officer of a Rohtak BJP MLA and minister Manish Grover while Ajay was a son of a local cop.

After investigations, name of Sachin of Chhara village name was also added in the FIR and subsequently Ajay and Sachin were arrested. Later, a chargesheet was filed against both but there was no mention of Manjeet, son of Grover’s PSO Davinder Yadav.

Pronouncing the judgment, additional district judge Jasbir Singh acquitted both, who were already out on bail.

This has brought the investigations by the police under scanner. Witnesses in the court stated that the shop, where the looted items were stored, was found unlocked while the police had claimed that it was locked. In the court the shop owner denied his statement that he had leased out his property to the accused. Moreover, the police had claimed that they had called up the showroom owner and complainant at the shop but the latter stated that he was shown the looted items in the police station and was not called at the spot. Besides, the cops did not seal the case property.

The police had registered 1,212 cases against 305 persons in Rohtak for the violence during Jat stir.

KOLKATA: The Bhangar violence seems to be the Vedic Village arson throwback, when an angry mob had set the resort on fire eight years back in 2009. Beneath the immediate reason -a clash over an innocuous football match in which a youth was killed -lay a mega plan of the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government to purchase 1600 acres of land for an IT township in the area through private promoter -Vedic Realty -of which 90 acres were to be handed over to IT majors Wipro and Infosys for setting up their projects. Unlike Singur and Nandigram, this was a private venture. But the effect was no different. Bhattacharjee had to scrap the project days after the violence.

The Bhangar land purchase, though on a much lower scale -only 16 acres and that too for the Power Grid Corporation (POWERGRID) project -has once again put a question mark on how sound is the policy of purchasing multi-crop land even though the Mamata Banerjee government has a land-neutral policy .

The fact of the matter at ground zero remains the same. Like Gaffar Mollah and Ruidas Mandal in the Vedic Realty case, Trinamool leader Arabul Islam and his team have a role in the Bhangar violence. Trinamool minister and local MLA Abdur Rezzak Molla stoked the fire by making a provocative comment over fertility of the villagers in a public meeting in the area few days back. While Arabul-loyalists maintain that the minister did it deliberately to muddy the waters, Molla suppor ters argue that the damage was done much before the MLA joined Trinamool in 2016.

Chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who is sensitive over the land question initially, tweeted on Tuesday that the project will be shifted elsewhere if locals do not want it there, and later retracted possibly having a second thought on whether the state government has the authority to make such an announcement on its own. The dilemma has given ammunition to the Opposition. CPM state secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra wanted the CM to make the scarp announcement at Bhangar like her predecessor had done at Nandigram. However, Mishra's demand has little impact in Bhangar because locals suffered similarly in Rajarhat, Ma hisgoth, Mahisbathan areas during the CPM rule.CPM leaders are thus giving support to the movement from behind lest the movement gets spoiled in the political wrangle.

But why did the villagers chose to fight now when the POWERGRID project is towards completion? Bhangar seems to be the flashpoint of all earlier land aggregations in the vicinity , and not just a rebuff to the POWERGRID project. It calls into question what the authorities told the village folk for all these years and what has happened on the ground. It also throws light on how the land was “purchased“ with the help of ruling partymen. For instance, the POWERGRID notification on October 22, 2016, states that project will benefit mostly the Bhangar, Rajarhat area and large tracts of North and South 24-Parganas. Villagers want to know how. They want to know how the powerhouse wastes will be discharged. Finally , it has brought to the fore if the new development model unlike the forcible acquisition in Singur leaves any scope for refusing land for the project.Add to this the lack of clarity over compensation rates. All these reflect a disconnect or mistrust among villagers making them prone to rumour on other environmental concerns. A POWERGRID press release says that the project is imporatant for power supply in Kolkata and Rajarhat apart from other areas. “This substation is created with a State-of-the-Art Gas Insulated Switchgear (GIS) Technology , which requires about 14th of the land as compared to conventional substation. GIS technology is safe, reliable and requires less maintenance,“ the press release claims .

What's more is the perception among villagers that authorities tweaked the original alignment of the 400 KV transmission lines to accommodate the upcoming real estate projects coming up near Vedic Village at Uttar Gazipur, Chandipur flanked by VIP Road, Jessore Road at the Rajarhat end, and instead being run over the multi-crop agricultural lands under heavy police presence.Bhangar, like Nandigram, has a substantial Muslim population among whom Trinamool has a solid support base. A section among Trinamool has active participation in the land stir like CPM supporters had during the Nandigram movement.Mamata isn't thus taking it lightly .

NAGPUR: Deputy commander of Kasansur dalam Jyoti Gawade was shot dead by Gadchiroli district police’s C-60 commandos at Botejhari and Badgaon forest on Thursday. She is alleged to be the architect of the state’s worst Naxalite arson attack which took place at Surjagarh on December 23 last year. 76 trucks, 3 JCBs and 1 motorcycles were burnt by the rebels.

Intelligence agencies have claimed that Jyoti had shifted to the north of Gadchiroli in the last fortnight to evade police. Shivaji Bodkhe, IG of state anti-naxal operations (ANO), said that Jyoti was trying to break through the police cordon when she received bullet injuries in retaliatory fire. “Police have also seized Jyoti’s .303 rifle,” he added.

Police said Jyoti was trying to contact her family at Botejhari village when the police swooped down on her. On Wednesday, the police had cornered Naxals at Nihalkai forest near Gyarapatti from where two .12 bore rifles were seized. After intensifying the search operations, the police spotted Jyoti’s dalams following which a battled ensued.

Jyoti, alias Sagobai Narsingh, was earlier commander of Surjagarh local guerrilla squad (LGS) which was later amalgamated with Kasansur dalam. Senior Naxal cadres had killed Jyoti’s husband, Diwakar who was a popular and seasoned leader of Tippagarh, in cold blood around four years ago.

After Diwakar’s murder, Jyoti was shifted to south Gadchiroli where she later was elevated to the rank of commander of Surjagarh LGS.

Gadchiroli SP Abhinav Deshmukh said that verifications are under way for “collecting concrete evidence” of Jyoti’s presence at the arson site.

The police had claimed that Kasansur dalam was present during the arson attack. Jyoti was its second-in-command after commander Mahesh Gota and divisional committee member Surjan Akka. The other dalams present at site were Perimili, Gatta local organization squads (LOS) and Bhamragarh.

Police claim that mine workers had said about the presence of a woman leading the Naxal attack. There were other women in the group too. The other leaders who are likely to have participated in the arson are commander Sainath of Perimili dalam, Dinesh of Bhamragarh dalam and Ramco of Gatta LOS.

PATIALA: Following reports of violence in the adjoining areas, the district administration today imposed curfew in the home district of the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh as a precautionary measure. He said the idea was to provide an easy exit to the followers of dera Sacha Sauda who would be returning from Panchkula.

Interacting with the media persons, IG Patiala range A S Rai said barring four sporadic incidents of arson attempts made by some anti-social elements, the situation in the Patiala range remained unaffected due to the violence.

While first such incident was reported from Lehragaga where some miscreants tried to set ablaze office of the local tehsildar, another incident was reported from Mankapur village near Banur where an attempt was made to set fire a local school. In the third incident which was reported from Handiaya in Barnala where the miscreants pelted stones on a Seva Kender.

Rai said that in all three incidents no major damage was reported. While at Lehragaga an office table was set ablaze, a window pane was shattered in the stone pelting incident at Handiaya and at Manikpur also the damage was not much. Besides, an attempt made to set fire a telephone exchange in Sular village in the Sangrur district was also foiled.

He said three FIRs under the Punjab Prevention of Damage to Public and Private Property Act of 2014 had been registered against efforts were on to identify the accused. He said that as per the provisions of this Act any damaged caused the public and private property will be recovered from the accused.

He said the security agencies and the intelligence wing of the police department were keeping a close watch on any related developments and assured that no one would be allowed to disrupt the law and order situation in the state.

Meanwhile, a complete restriction on movement of any traffic on roads leading to the Private residence of Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh the New Moti Bagh Palace had been put into effect this morning. The markets and work places across Ropar, Fatehgarh Sahib , Patiala and Sangrur district wore a deserted look with the locals staying away from roads.

CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court has held that release of the main accused, who was leading the mob that had set Haryana finance minister Captain Abhimanyu Singh ’s house on fire in Rohtak during Jat violence, may lead to “tampering” of prosecution witnesses.

The matter is being investigated by the CBI after the Haryana government had handed over the case to the premier investigation agency in August.

The court passed these orders while dismissing the bail plea of Dilawar Singh, an ex-serviceman who is behind bars since February when the state had witnessed violence during the Jat stir.

“Prima facie, the petitioner was the leader of the mob that indulged in arson, loot and burning of the house of Captain Abhimanyu. The offences are serious and there is every likelihood of tampering prosecution witnesses if the petitioner is released on bail. In that view of the matter, the prayer for grant of regular bail to the petitioner is rejected,” stated Justice A B Chaudhari in his order released on Tuesday.

Justice Chaudhari further observed that the inmates of the house had to take shelter somewhere else as the entire kothi was burnt. “The petitioner was seen as the leader of the mob in setting on fire and entering the premises . It is not in dispute that there was order under Section 144 of the CrPC at that time. There is, thus, ample evidence against the petitioner and in no case he can be released on bail in the wake of such evidence that of eyewitnesses,” the court said.

Dilawar Singh had approached the HC seeking bail on the ground that the matter had been taken over by the CBI that might take its time for investigation. He further submitted that there was no offence against him nor any recovery has been made from him and as such, he ought to be released on bail as he had been behind bars for over nine months.

Opposing the bail, the state argued that two eyewitnesses — Naveen Dhull and Ram Niwas Hooda — have named Dilawar in person who was seen performing the overt act when the building was being set on fire.

Dilawar, however, argued that the statements were recorded in March 2016, two months after the incident and, therefore, no importance could be given to those statements. Dilawar Singh had taken voluntary retirement from the Air Force and returned to Haryana in February and immediately after that he was arrested for his alleged involvement in the incident.

RAIPUR: With the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) indicting seven policemen for allegedly burning houses during a 2011 anti-Naxalite operation in Chhattisgarh 's Tadmetla, the confrontation between Bastar police on one hand and civil rights, social activists and Opposition parties on other has intensified.

State's special police officers (SPOs)-turned assistant constables staged an unusual protest on the streets of Bastar on Monday evening while burning effigies of Delhi University professor Nandini Sundar, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and tribal activist Soni Sori, Communist Party of India (CPI) leader and former MLA Manish Kunjam, social activists Himanshu Kumar and Bela Bhatia apart from journalist Malini Subramanian because they have been moving courts and raising issues of human rights violations in the strife-torn region.

Later, an unsigned press release from ""all assistant constables"" was given to the media through WhatsApp groups. The release said: ""The Maoists have killed thousands of tribals in Bastar and also create obstacles in development. The rebels do not believe in civil administration or judicial system and are also against democracy. We, the assistant constables, are local tribals and have joined the security forces to protect Bastar from the Naxalites. Nandini Sundar, Bela Bhatia, Himanshu Kumar, Soni Sori and Manish Kunjam are Maoist supporters, who thrive on the money from the Naxals."" The release added: ""Nandini Sundar has been visiting Bastar in the guise of a journalist to instigate people against the security forces.""

""The Maoists had killed 76 security personnel at Tadmetla in April 2010. When the forces launched an operation at Tadmetla in 2011, activists presented wrong facts before the people and even in court,"" the release said.

Though chief minister Raman Singh had made a statement that the matter would be inquired into and law will take its own course, the state government is yet to make its position public with regard to the CBI indicting policemen and the effigy burning protest by policemen.

Activist Kumar wrote on Facebook: ""Its anarchy in Bastar. Such a protest by District Reserve Guards (DRG) under the leadership of inspector general of police (Bastar range) SRP Kalluri, is in fact a revolt against the state government."" He said that the forces comprising former SPOs are functioning like a 'gunda gang'. The activist also wrote on Facebook that lives of social activists, political party workers and journalists are in danger. ""Specifically, tribal activist and AAP leader Soni Sori besides her nephew are facing threats,"" he alleged.

CPI veteran Chittaranjan Bakshi demanded suspension and arrest of Kalluri. ""Bastar IG said that whenever there is ""yudh' (war), there will fire and bombardment. Such remarks gives an impression that he is above the CBI and even Supreme Court"" the 84-year-old leader said.

AAP's state secretary Nagesh Banchore said the burning of effigies is an attempt by the ruling BJP to divert public attention from CBI's indictment of policemen. ""Now, Raman Singh must make it clear when it approved or rejected the CBI's Tadmetla report,"" he said.

The total damage caused by the suspect was estimated at Rs 4 lakh

PUNE: Rakesh Kadam was among those whose motorcycle was gutted in Sunday's incident in which a drunken man set fire to 30 vehicles.

In the incident, a threewheeler tempo pickup, 27 motorcycles and two bicycles were destroyed.

Add to their woes, few vehicles that were destroyed had insurance cover.

The police are still ascertaining the motive, but Kadam believes the suspect, Jabya Hari Patil (25) aka Nilesh, was out to steal fuel from the parked vehicles. Kadam told TOI that he and a few others had checked the fuel pipes of other vehicles and found them tampered with. “Patil may have tried to steal petrol, and then set the vehicles on fire,“ Kadam said.

Kadam further added that the area where he lives -Janata Vasahat slums -is plagued by fuel thefts. “We do not have proper parking space here. Nor can we can park out vehicles in front of our houses. Because of this, we park vehicles along the main road,“ Kadam said, “Miscreants take advantage of this and steal petrol.“

A crime branch officer admitted fuel thefts were a menace. “The Janata Vasahat residents never fill petrol in their vehicles' tanks while returning home at night. This was a blessing. Had the fuel tanks been full on Sunday morning, the fire could have engulfed a higher number of vehicles,“ the officer said.

How he was held

Sub-inspector Anil Dap hal of Dattawadi police, who is probing the case, said the suspect was arrested on a tipoff. Patil stays on Lane No. 38, which was located exactly opposite the public toilet, which was the crime scene. “A few witnesses had seen Patil near the spot minutes before the fire broke out,“ Daphal said.

A police team led by se nior inspector Anil Patil and comprising constables Anil More, Abhijit Kalaskar and Ashok Hirwale , tracked Patil down to near the vicinity of his home and nabbed him.“During questioning, Patil confessed that he had set the vehicles on fire,“ Daphal said. According to Daphal, Pa til who works at a private company , got his salary on Saturday. “He had spent his salary on liquor and returned home drunk in the early hours of Sunday. We will question him further after getting police custody from the court,“ Daphal said.

NEW DELHI: The arson attacks on schools in Kashmir are seen by the central security establishment as an attempt by local mischief mongers and separatists to keep the “fires burning”, now that the protests over the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Burhan Wani have died down.

Sources in the intelligence agencies told TOI on Tuesday that nearly 80% of the schools attacked over the past three to four months were set on fire after Eid ul Adha on September 12. “By that time, the violent stone-pelting agitations had largely been brought under control. So, the trouble-makers changed their strategy and started targeting schools. This way they could deny that normalcy was back in the Valley,” said an intelligence operative.

According to a senior IPS officer, by instigating local youth to set schools on fire, those orchestrating violence in the Valley since July aimed to keep the authorities “engaged”. A J&K police officer said the arsonists, as evident from the profile of those arrested so far, are mostly uneducated and unemployed youth blindly following directions of local separatists. They may also be getting paid by “agents”.

The motive behind targeting schools goes beyond just creating unrest. Schools in Kashmir close for vacations in the winter, and are used to accommodate the security forces. “The idea is to deny the forces logistics for their stay,” said an officer. Also, given that most of the schools targeted are modern educational institutions, the agencies suspect a “radical” agenda.

An intelligence officer told TOI that though their crackdown on separatist elements and local mischief mongers in September-October had managed to break the cycle of violence in the Valley, the reluctance of the state government of late to persist with arrests and raids may have given the trouble-makers a breather to bounce back.

“We suspect local Jamaate-Islami leaders as being behind the school attacks. Some local boys have been identified and arrested. But certain big names in south Kashmir still roam free,” the officer conceded.

Officials feel there is a silver lining to the targeted attacks on schools in the Valley. “The civil society elements who were, until now, unwilling to take a stand against the separatists and the lead trouble-makers, are now coming out to condemn the burning of educational institutions,” said a police officer.

This has landed Kumar behind bars, while his two brothers and a friend who helped them commit the crime are on the run.Kumar, a resident of Sanjay Nagar, along with his brothers Srinivas and Naveen , sells vegetables at K R Puram vegetable market.They had a bone to pick with two brothers who were frequent visitors to the market. The brothers, residents of Diesel Shed Road, would berate the trio for selling low quality vegetables for higher prices. They complained the vegetables were having an adverse effect on anyone consuming them.This was detrimental to the trio’s business and they decided to teach the brothers a lesson they would never forget.They followed the victim and found out where they stayed.“The accused initially hatched a plot to harm the victims, but later backed out fearing arrest.

Suspecting foul play, they checked the area and found their scooter burnt and hidden inside the bushes. The family then filed a complaint with the jurisdictional K R Puram police who registered a case of mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to cause damage (IPC 435) and theft (IPC 379).“The victims initially didn’t suspect the vegetable vendors.

KEONJHAR: Ten students, including two girls, of Anandpur College , 80 km from here, were arrested on Monday on charges of ransacking and setting fire to the college office and the teachers' common room. The college has been closed sine die.

Tension erupted after a presidential candidate, said to be supporter of independent MLA of Champua Sanatan Mohakud, was disqualified by the college authorities. A group of students then entered the college and ransacked the college office and set stationery ablaze. They damaged furniture, TV and computers in the office and the teacher's common room. Police have been deployed near the college to avoid any untoward incident.

Later the students staged protest sitting in front of the college demanding withdrawal of disqualification order on the presidential candidate.

After a meeting of management committee of the college, it was closed sine die. Police resorted to lathicharge to disperse students, said a student. But police denied any lathicharge and said they only drove away the students.

District intelligence bureau DSP Harischandra Pandey said a case has been registered in Anandpur police station and some students are arrested in this incident.

Sub-collector, Anandpur, Maheswar Swain said authorities are keeping a close watch on the situation.

KOLKATA/DARJEELING: The Calcutta high court on Friday declared Gorkha Janmukti Morcha’s call for an indefinite Darjeeling bandh illegal, prompting the party to switch to track-two diplomacy and knock on Raj Bhavan’s doors for a tripartite meeting even as its cadres continued with their belligerence in the Hills .

Acting Chief Justice Nishita Mhatre passed the order on Friday, directing the Bengal government to ensure free movement in the Hills and provide adequate protection to tourists, students and Hills residents. She also asked the state to assess the quantum of damage to public property from the start of GJM’s lock-down on June 9 and submit a report by June-end. The damage during the 2013 GJM stir was estimated at Rs 69 crore.

The court directed petitioner Ramaprasad Sarkar to serve notices to GJM leaders Bimal Gurung and Roshan Giri.

The HC order had an immediate fallout as three GJM MLAs — Amar Rai, Sarita Rai and Rohit Sharma — approached Raj Bhavan, seeking a tripartite meeting with the Centre and the state.

In the Hills, however, there was little evidence of any attempt at conciliation. The shutdown was near-total and the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway suspended operations indefinitely following the arson at Gayabari station. There was no violence in Darjeeling proper as GJM supporters also flexed muscles downhill in Kalimpong, Bijanbari, Mirik and Birpara in the Dooars. But GJM leaders denied their supporters were involved in arson.

The GJM women’s wing staged a demonstration outside party president Bimal Gurung’s house and office in Patlewas, five km away, where police had carried out a raid on Thursday. Slogan-shouting women tried to march towards the party’s headquarters in Singmari but were stopped by a CRPF contingent.

Reports of violence continued from late Thursday. The Gayabari incident was followed by suspected GJM supporters torching a primary health centre and bill payment office of the Lodhoma-Rimbick hydel power project, nearly 70 km from Darjeeling. In Mirik, which was declared a new sub-division recently by CM Mamata Banerjee, the Dora-I gram panchayat office was set ablaze.

GJM supporters also tried to extend their outreach to the Terai and the Dooars regions. GJM supporters on Friday mobbed the Birpara police station in Dooars, following a secret meeting held at Jaigaon along the Indo-Bhutan border, sending alarm bells ringing at the neighbouring police stations of Chamurchi and Banarhat.

The Centre and state governments stepped up the pressure on the GJM, with two columns of Army taking up position in front of the GJM party headquarters in Singmari, where GJM supporters had clashed with police on Thursday.

Nothing, however, could bring life back to the Queen of the Hills. There was hardly any transport at the Chowrasta taxi stand, adding to the woes of students who came for the North Bengal University’s bachelors’ examinations.

Police said they had tried to convince shopowners and other traders to open their establishments, but the latter said they were afraid.

Meanwhile, Chhattisgarh chief minister and BJP leader Raman Singh visited West Midnapore on Friday and said the Bengal government could sort out the impasse in the Hills through dialogue. “People in the Hills, or those leading the agitation, may have some reasons for their anguish. The state government can redress the grievances by inviting them to talks,” said Singh.

DARJEELING: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha ( GJM ) has asked tourists to leave Darjeeling and warned those who stay on during its attempted lockdown of administrative offices and banks that they are doing so “at their own risk“.

On Saturday night, five GJM supporters were arrested for the violence during the state cabinet meeting.

“The situation is turning worse, and anything can happen. I appeal to them (tourists) to leave,“ GJM president Bimal Gurung said after a party meeting in Patleybas near Singamari on Sunday .

Gurung's diktat, which is likely to hit the Hills economy and its residents harder than tourists, came after yet another signal from the Mamata Banerjee government that it intended to clamp down on the stir. “This is an extra-constitutional diktat, blatantly illegal. Gurung heads a legally mandated selfautonomous council; he isn't above the law himself,“ said state tourism minister Gautam Deb. Like the last three days, Sunday also saw a huge rush of tourists trying to get out of the Hills. “We had booked a hotel from Thursday to Sunday in Darjeeling, but because of the unrest we stayed in Kurseong,“ said a tourist.

Sudhakar Naidu was one of the guests who had shared the dais along with Mudragada Padmanabham during the Kapu Garjana meeting. Sources said he elaborated the circumstances that led to the violence.

Public property was set ablaze by the agitators following the Kapu Garjana meeting conducted by Kapu leader Mudragada Padmanabham on January 31 at Tuni. East Godavari cops and CID officers had analysed thousands of video clips related to the incident and arrested 12 persons, who later got bail after Mudragada went on an indefinite hunger strike demanding their release.

Highlights The woman suspected to have instigated the arson attack was allegedly offered Rs 100 and a plate of biryani

C Bhagya, identified from video footage, is a daily wager

She is the only woman among the 400 arrested for arson attack in Bengaluru

BENGALURU: A 22-year-old woman suspected to have instigated the arson attack on 42 buses of a Tamil Nadu-based operator in Bengaluru last week was allegedly offered Rs 100 and a plate of biryani to join the protests over Cauvery water-sharing .

C Bhagya is one of 11 people arrested for the September 12 attack. The suspects have been accused of dousing the crew of the KPN fleet with diesel and threatening to burn them. It was on account of CCTV footage from the yard where the buses were parked, as well as mobile phone videos filmed by the crew, that police suspected Bhagya to be the agent provocateur.

However, Bhagya's mother Yellamma has told the media that her daughter was offered Rs 100 and a plate of mutton biryani by “friends“ to join the protests. Bhagya stays with her parents in Girinagar, close to the KPN garage, and is a daily wager. “Bhagya had just returned home around noon (on September 12) when some men known to her came over and asked her to join the protests.They promised to give her biryani and Rs 100 at the end of the day,"" Yellamma said.

Police sources said the footage from the arson site also shows other women, but it is not clear if they played an active role in the vandalism. Bhagya is the only woman among the 400-odd people arrested in connection with the September 12 violence in Bengaluru. She is currently in police custody for further questioning.

A senior police officer said it was not yet clear if Bhagya was leading the mob. “As of now, we can say she was one of the arsonists,“ the officer added.

Bhubaneswar: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) conducted a simulation exercise at Puri Railway Station on Sunday as part of its probe into the serial burning of three empty trains there November 12 last year.

Prime accused Subhash Ramachandran, who is suspected to have links with a terror outfit, was taken to the station amid tight security where police reconstructed the sequence of events that led to burning of five coaches at different platforms. Railway police had a tough time to control crowd that gathered at the station to witness the mock drill.

While NIA officials remained tightlipped about findings of the exercise, railway police said the motive behind the exercise was to ascertain how Ramachandran triggered the arson and whether other persons were involved in the serial fire.

The mock exercise was conducted at the coaching depot where Ramachandran was asked to set fire to some seats using a chemical substance. The burnt remains were collected by the NIA for forensic test. On Monday, the NIA is likely to conduct a second round exercise to know whether Ramachandran took the assistance of others in the crime, said a railway police officer.

JAIPUR: The banjaras of Dhikola in Bhilwara heaved a sigh of relief as the sessions court in Shahpura refused to allow the government to withdraw the FIR registered in August 2014 case of arson against a mob that attacked the homes of 42 banjara families .

On November 23, 2016, the principal secretary in the home department of the state government had sought that in “public interest”, this FIR be withdrawn. Activists were riled, and questioned whose “interests” the government upheld –of victims or perpetrators of crime.

On August 19, 2014, in an unprovoked attack, a mob armed with sharp weapons poured kerosene on the possessions and homes of 42 families of the traditionally nomadic Banjara community at Dhikola in Shahpura gram panchayat of Bhilwara district. Motorcycles and tractors were reduced to cinders and homes turned into ash. The FIR was registered under sections pertaining to rioting and carrying deadly weapons. There were 141 accused and 46 were arrested.

On Friday, arguing against the withdrawal of the FIR by the government, Suresh Srimali , lawyer of the Banjaras, said that the charges were grave. Withdrawal of the FIR would be a bolt to the justice delivery mechanism of the state, he said. The court refused to allow the government to withdraw FIR and posted the matter for hearing on August 4.

Paras Banjara, the only graduate from the community, said this represented a victory for his people. “Despite our urging, the government refused to review its decision to withdraw the FIR. We are glad the court listened to our plea. The Banjaras are a people with faith in the Constitution and the judiciary. We will continue to struggle for justice.”

CHANDIGARH: The Haryana government’s decision to hand over the probe of two cases related to damage to the residence and other properties of state finance minister Capt Abhimanyu’s family to the CBI has been challenged in the Punjab and Haryana high court.

The main argument against it is that once a probe is completed by the police and investigation report submitted to a magistrate, a fresh investigation into the same matter cannot be ordered. The petitioner, Ashvin, one of the accused in this case and a resident of Chuliyana village in Rohtak district, has sought directions to quash the notification regarding handing over the matter to the CBI.

The petition, which came up for hearing on Monday, stated that there were only two FIRs in this regard. In FIR no. 45 there is one accused while in FIR no. 118 there are 40 accused. According to the petitioner, investigation has been completed and final reports have been submitted by the police to the magistrate. After this, now , the state government has referred the matter to the CBI.

Ashvin contended that no application was moved by the police before the magistrate, seeking permission for fresh or further investigation or before the higher court seeking permission for a CBI probe .

Strongly opposing the state government’s move, the petitioner has argued that the said powers could only be exercised where the investigation has not been completed and if completed, the magistrate has not taken cognizance of that report.

“If the investigation has been completed on the same set of allegations pertaining to the same offence by the police and the final report under section 173 (2) of the CrPC has been submitted before the court on which the magistrate has taken cognizance and has committed the case to the competent court, then the powers to send it to the CBI for further probe cannot be exercised,” he argued.

After hearing the arguments of the petitioner, Justice Rajesh Bindal of the HC referred it for further hearing before a bench headed by Justice S S Saron, which is already hearing the cases related to Jat reservation.

NEW DELHI: CBI has registered two separate cases in connection with the alleged arson at Indus Public School and Haribhoomi Press in Rohtak during the Jat quota agitation in February last year.

These properties reportedly belong to trusts run by Haryana minister Captain Abhimanyu, CBI sources said.

The CBI move comes after the Centre referred the cases to it on February 6, 2017, nearly an year after the incidents.

At least 30 people were killed and properties worth crores of rupees were destroyed in Haryana during the violent quota agitation by Jats in February, 2016.

The protesters were seeking reservation in government jobs and educational institutes for the Jat community under the category of Other Backward Classes.

It is alleged that some people gathered around the school in Rohtak on the evening of February 19. These people threatened the guard and ransacked the school.

On February 20, a mob of 100-150 people armed with oil cannisters and rods gathered around the school. They allegedly ransacked the property and put the building, school buses and other vehicles on the properties on fire.

MEHSANA/RAJKOT:Patels agitating for reservation on Monday set fire to the Mehsana bungalow of Gujarat junior home minister Rajnikant Patel.

The arson attack came as police booked over 5,000 people for violence that began on Sunday following a ‘jail bharo’ call issued by Patidar organizations for an employment and education quota as well as the immediate release of activists leading the movement, including Hardik Patel.

Patidars had also torched the minister’s house in August last year when the stir for quota first erupted.

Nagpur: Three days after the Naxalites allegedly torched 80 vehicles deployed by contractors engaged by Lloyds Metals and Energy Ltd at Surjagarh iron ore mines in Gadchiroli, the company has assessed its loss at Rs13 crore. It had begun mining operations in April this year, after a deadlock since 2007 due to opposition by the Naxalites against any activity in the area.

“Salvaging the equipment is the first priority now. No decision has been taken on restarting the operations yet. However, after going so far and investing a sizeable amount, abandoning the project will certainly not be the company’s priority,” said a source involved in running the mines.

The company has so far taken away only the iron ore available on the surface with excavation work not even having started. Since October, 80,000 tons have been extracted, as against the permitted quantity of 6 lakh tons per annum in the mining plan.

“The iron ore is being used in the company’s processing plant at Ghuggus (neighbouring Chandrapur district),” said company sources.

Lloyds is the only company doing operations in Surjagarh as permits to many big companies were taken back as they showed no interest to start work.

The minister of state for home Hansraj Ahir, who is from Chandrapur district, held a review meeting on Tuesday, in which the company’s officials submitted their version. He also spoke to the CRPF and police.

Talking to TOI, company officials claimed that there was no direct interference from the Naxalites so far. “Why they chose to burn down the trucks is not known,” he said.

However, sources following the developments hint at a recent friction between the contractors involved in the work and the Naxalites.

“Chances of the locals employed in the company doubling up as Naxals cannot be ruled out as burning down 70 vehicles has to be the handiwork of a huge mob,” said an independent source who has been closely observing the the work at the mines.

The company had got a mining licence for an area of 340 hectares in the Surjagargh hills, over 100 kms from Gadchiroli town. The first attempt to mine in 2008 could not succeed as Naxals burnt down vehicles and beat up the staffers. Later, in 2013, the company’s vice-president Jaspal Dhillon was killed in a reported attempt to negotiate with the rebels.

Finally, in April this year the company began operation and so far only an area of 4 hectares out of 340 have been utilized. Rest of the land is yet to be diverted by the state’s forest department, a process which will take place gradually.

Local sources say that the mining could begin as Naxal leadership in the area had softened its stance as a number of locals were employed in the project too. Again, in June, the work had stopped following an agitation.

This time it was led by local leaders demanding that the company set up an iron ore processing plant close to the mines. The work was also halted due to the monsoon but started again in October.

Sources following the development say that friction between the contractors running the vehicles and Naxalites could also be the reason for the incident. Demonetization has hit the availability of cash in the interiors, leading to some friction over payments.

PUNE: Investigations have revealed that stationery shopowner Aman Abdul Shaikh (33), who was arrested on Saturday for allegedly torching 92 vehicles on Sinhagad Road and Narhe areas on June 28, had conducted a recce of all the spots a day before committing the crime.

""On tracking Shaikh's cellphone locations, it was found that he had visited all the six spots a day before the incident. He had planned the arson well in advance,"" said Nitin Jadhav, the investigating officer and senior inspector of the Sinhagad Road police station. Now, we are collecting information about his whereabouts on June 28, he added.

We are also verifying his whereabouts on the day of incident and also what he had done till he was arrested on Saturday,"" senior inspector of the Sinhagad Road police station Nitin Jadhav, who is investigating the case, said.

Shaikh, who was arrested on Saturday night, was produced before the court on Sunday and remanded to police custody till July 7.

While seeking his custody, Jadhav told the court that residents of Sai Palace of Vadgaon-Budruk, where Shaikh resides with his family, have identified the suspect because of the limp in his right leg, which was also captured in a closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera footage. ""Around a year ago, Shaikh had set ablaze one motorcycle in his society. He also had two similar cases registered against him with the Khadki police station,"" Jadhav said.

Though police are yet to ascertain the motive behind the incident, Jadhav told the court that investigations are being done to find out if someone had instigated him to commit the crime or the act was done only to create law and order problem.

Meanwhile, police also recovered a scooter from Shaikh. ""However, we are yet to confirm if the same was used in committing the crime since the registration number of the scooter is not clear in the CCTV camera footages,"" Jadhav told the court. Police are also probing the modus operandi of the suspect and if there were any witnesses in the case, he added.

Jadhav said police are yet to recover the clothes Shaikh wore on the night of the incident. ""We want to send the clothes for chemical analysis,"" he said.

Shaikh's counsel I H Hasmani told the court that his client was arrested only on the basis of suspicion. ""Police have nothing to prove his involvement in the case. He has been arrested on the basis of the old cases registered against him. But, he has been acquitted in one of the two cases,"" Hasmani said.

After hearing both the sides, the judicial magistrate first class S S Pignle sent Shaikh to the police custody till July 7.

On June 28, as many as 77 two-wheelers, eight cars and seven bicycles were set ablaze at a pizza outlet and five housing societies — all located along a five-km stretch from Anandnagar on Sinhagad Road to Narhe. The pandemonium continued for one-and-half-hour.

The fires in the parking spaces of the housing societies had created panic among residents.

Mumbai: The 37th metropolitan magistrate court has issued a production warrant to jail authorities in Mumbai asking them to produce former deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal in connection with an attack on his house in 1997.

The court is in the last leg of winding up the 20-year-old case in which 11 Shiv Sainiks are accused. Bhujbal’s statement will be recorded in the case. The former minister, who has been arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in cases related to money laundering and the construction of Maharashtra Sadan and the varsity library deal, is currently lodged in Arthur Road prison. It has to be seen whether or not the jail authorities will produce him in the court on November 28, which clashes with the dates related to the cases that the ED is pursuing. The court wants to record his statement in the nearly two decades old case in which he is a witness. Crime branch officials have recorded the statements of around 36 witnesses and only Bhujbal’s testimony is remaining. “Once Bhujbal’s statement is recorded the court is likely to deliver the verdict,” said a police officer. The case was later transferred to the crime branch, which arrested around 23 Sainiks. Eight people were later discharged as the police could not find evidence against them.

HOWRAH: A Trinamool faction fight kept Shalimar rail yard in Howrah on the boil all through Friday - with less than 24 hours to go before Kolkata goes to polls - after the brother of a party councillor died of gunshots suffered in a clash on April 6.

Five trucks, three trailers and an SUV were set ablaze just 800 yards from Mamata Banerjee's headquarters at Nabanna.

Bands of hooligans played a cat-and-mouse game with police as they went around torching vehicles. The harried cops struggled to keep up and at one point, disaster was averted by a hair's breadth after a trailer was set fire too close to a mall. The tyres started exploding and columns of smoke shot into the shopping complex. Luckily, the fire brigade responded quickly and doused the flames. According to police, the miscreants had dipped bread in petrol and used it to set fire to the vehicles.

The area has been tense ever since two factions, allegedly owing allegiance to Howrah Municipal Corporation councillor Benoy Singh and his business and political rival Pradip Tiwari, fired at each other 10 days ago. Benoy's brother Vinod and nephew Rakesh Singh were injured. Vinod, who was in coma after being shot in the chest, died on Friday. As soon as news reached Howrah, a mob set fire to an Innova parked in front of Tiwari's office. Tiwari's brother Paritosh is accused of shooting Vinod and Rakesh, say sources.

Singh and Tiwari are clearing agents at the yard and the April 6 clash had disrupted loading and unloading, leading to losses of crores. The gunfight also opened up chinks in the Howrah Trinamool ranks.

During the last corporation polls in 2013, Singh had contested on a Congress ticket and defeated Trinamool candidate Tiwari in Ward 35. Singh, however, defected to Trinamool after his victory. Pradip Tiwari, a former Left Front councillor from the ward, had been handpicked by Mukul Roy but is now cornered in the party ever since his mentor, too, was sidelined.

Trinamool district president Aroop Roy said, ""Tiwari was always with the Left and came to our party for personal gain. We have information that he will have go back to the Left after his interest is over. We have expelled him from the party.""

However, a section of the party ranks alleges that Tiwari was sheltered by Trinamool MP from Howrah Prasun Banerjee, who made him president of the Trinamool port union. Trinamool councilor Sailesh Rai said, ""It is very unfortunate that despite his expulsion from the party he has been given shelter by a party MP."" Prasun called the allegation baseless. ""When I became MP, Tiwari asked for a job in the party. I made him president of the port cell but later I found he is of no use,"" he told TOI.

All the accused in the April 6 violence - Tiwari's relatives Paritosh, Anup, Anil, Kamlesh, Ajay and Sanjay - are on the run, say police. SRP Kharagpur Joy Biswas said, ""They have fled but we have some information and are trying to arrest them."" Sources in Howrah police say Paritosh's mobile phone has been tracked to Uttar Pradesh. ""Till three days ago, they were being given shelter by one of Pradip's relatives in north Howrah, but by the time we got there, they had fled. We are tracking them and they will be arrested very soon,"" said an officer.

AHMEDABAD: Police on Wednesday nabbed Rasik Chauhan, 30, a resident of Bhimjipura in Nava Vadaj, for burning about a dozen bikes and an ATM center.

Police said Chauhan derived sadistic pleasure from the act. ""We suspect that Chauhan, who himself is an auto driver, had dreams to buy a bike but could not because of his poor economic condition,"" said a police official.

Since the past 14 days complaints of bikes being torched in the night as well as in the daytime were on the rise in the jurisdiction of Narapura police.

""On Wednesday, we arrested Chauhan from Bhimjipura crossroads on a tip off and found a match box in his pocket. On being quizzed he admitted he used to torch the bikes and even tried to torch an ATM center in Silver Plaza in Bhimjipura,"" said the official.

Police said Chauhan smokes bidis and always keeps a match box with him. ""Whenever he felt that no one was watching he would pull the petrol pipe of the bike and throw a burning matchstick,"" the official said.

During primary interrogation it came to light that Chauhan had got petrol from bike parked outside the ATM center. He then threw the petrol on the ATM center and set it ablaze with a matchstick.

Chauhan had set ablaze vehicles near Naranpura railway crossing, Sorabji compound and Juna Vadaj area. ""We are probing whether Chauhan is involved in such incidents in other parts of the city as well"" added the official.

BHUBANESWAR: Subhash Ramachandran, a Tamil Nadu resident accused of setting ablaze a series of empty trains in Puri on November 12 and other places in the country, was involved in petty offences in Chennai, police confirmed. Efforts by police to gather more information about him from Tamil Nadu Police failed due to the floods in Chennai.

""Between 2011 and 2012, Ramachandran was involved in three theft cases, though he was never arrested. The cases were sorted out by mutual understanding. In 2012, he stole a bike. The same year, he decamped with Rs 5,000 from a hotel where he was employed in Chennai,"" special director (intelligence) Arun Sarangi told TOI.

While the NIA on December 3 took up the case, police said the floods hindered their investigation. ""Ramachandran belongs to Tirunelveli district in Tamil Nadu. Since he spent most of his years in that state, we needed to know his antecedents. But, the Chennai cloudburst posed hurdles for us,"" Sarangi said.

Police still believe Ramachandran's activities were suspicious and he had links with some terror outfit. But the cops are yet to ascertain the name of the group. ""Ramachandran has so far not revealed the name of any subversive group. He only claimed that five terrorists paid him money to cause the attacks. He also claimed that a terror module was prepared in Mumbai. There is no corroborative evidence of his statements,"" Sarangi said.

Earlier, Ramachanadran had told the railway police that he came in contact with the terrorists during last year's Chennai train blast. He claimed that the terrorists were linked to an agency in Pakistan, after which Odisha Police on November 26 recommended that the Centre hand over the probe to the NIA.

On December 7, Ramachandran underwent a polygraph test at the state forensic science laboratory. Police received the report on Thursday. ""We wanted to verify whether his earlier statements were true. Of 24 questions asked to him, he gave deceitful replies to nine. He gave contradictory statements, which he has done in the past too. He reiterated that he knew five terrorists. He claimed they were from Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan and Bangladesh. But there is no evidence to confirm this information. He also spoke of his girlfriend and said he needed more money. He also claimed to have undergone training in Mumbai. His statements will be verified,"" ADG (railway police) M Nageswar Rao said.

BHUBANESWAR: Subhash Ramachandran, suspected of having link with a terror group and prime accused in the burning of empty trains in Puri and other places in India, underwent marathon grilling by police during a polygraph test here on Monday.

Official sources said the lie-detection test came a cropper as the 27-year-old Ramachandran dodged most of the queries. ""He did not cooperate with us during the polygraph test. His answers to a few questions were vague and contradictory to his previous confessions in police custody,"" said a police officer.

The government railway police (GRP) had sought a Puri court's permission for lie-detection test on Ramachandran after his inconsistent replies during interrogation in the custody.

Ramachandran was asked at least 120 questions at the State Forensic Science Laboratory from 10.15am to 5.15pm. Since he belongs to Tamil Nadu, police engaged a Tamil interpreter for the polygraph test.

On December 3, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) took over the investigation into burning of empty trains in Puri, Haridwar, Gaya and Kharagpur. On November 26, the state government recommended NIA probe after finding suspected terror link behind the incidents. The NIA SP Prashant Kumar has been camping in Bhubaneswar for the past few days and interrogating Ramachandran. A team of police officers from Kharagpur and Haridwar have already interrogated Ramachandran.

Official sources said the NIA is likely to conduct brain-mapping on Ramachandran. India's only forensic science laboratory that conducts brain-mapping or brain-wave fingerprinting test is located in Bangalore.

It is a test that maps the brain to reveal the guilty knowledge. Forensic experts would apply modern technologies to find out if the brain of the accused recognizes sequences from the crime scene that is oblivious to an innocent person, a police officer said. In brain-mapping, the accused is first interrogated to find out whether he is concealing any information. Then sensors are attached to the subjects head and the person is made to sit before a computer monitor. He is then shown certain images or made to hear certain sounds. The sensors monitor electrical activity in the brain, the police officer added.

Even though brain mapping is considered one of the most effective aspect of forensic science these days, lawyers said it would not be admissible as an evidence in the court of law. ""Outcomes of polygraph, narco test and brain-mapping are just corroborative evidence. It will not help police prove a suspect guilty,"" said Orissa high court lawyer Bibhu Prasad Tripathy.

Thane: All the 18 men accused of the arson attack in Bhiwandi , which led to the death of two on-duty constables in July 2006, walked free after the district sessions court on September 1 quashed charges of rioting and assault on police personnel against them.

The lack of clinching evidence, failure to ensure air-tight statements of witness and procedural flaws in the identification parade of the accused led to the acquittal, it is learnt. Judge A S Bhaisare ruled that the prosecution failed to prove charges beyond reasonable doubt and, giving them the benefit of doubt, set them free.

The case had aroused strong sentiments across the state as it was the first time after the Mumbai riots that clashes had erupted between police and members of a minority community in the powerloom township.

The immediate trigger of the violence was opposition of the community, then led by Raza Academy, against construction of a police station on a plot near the Muslim-dominated pocket of Islampura. The land, earmarked for a police station, was opposite a masjid and adjoining a Muslim cemetery, and community leaders demanded that the land be allotted for an Urdu medium school and the cemetery area must be extended.

Additional public prosecutor Dilip Bahiram told the court that the mob led by Raza Academy functionary Shakil Raza started demolishing the under-construction police station and pelted stones at the police on July 5, 2006. At Dhamankar naka police chowky, Shakil Raza, along with around 300 associates came from Patel compound shouting slogans like ‘Police khade hai, unko pakdo aur maro, kato’.

A constable was allegedly attacked and her uniform was torn by a mob of women. The constable, however, was rescued by SRPF personnel, who were later stoned by the mob.

Constables Ramesh Jagtap and Balu Gangurde, who were patrolling on a motorcycle, were stoned and then attacked with rods and sharps weapons by mostly teenagers and youths, and their two-wheeler was torched. The constables died on the spot.

Advocate Dhananjay Patil, who argued for the accused, told court that the accused were innocent. He did not produce any witness.

The issue had triggered a storm in the monsoon session of the state legislature after then home minister R R Patil remarked that the attack against police will not go unanswered. He had said, “Bricks will be retaliated with bullets.’’

Aligarh: Villagers of Kastali, Jawan in Aligarh poured out into the streets in anger, noticing that cows had been slaughtered and the waste was littering the area. Angry villagers set about burning vehicles used to transport the meat. Policemen present in the area were attacked.

On Monday, a day after the arson, SSP Aligarh J Ravinder Goud suspended seven policemen for poor handing of the situation. Policemen found at least 21 cows had been killed. Eleven people from Tonk in Rajasthan have been arrested for selling the cows. The role of others in the illegal slaughter is being investigated.

“We have zero-tolerance for those involved in the cow slaughter. Even if policemen are found involved in the theft and slaughter of cows, they will not be spared. There will be increased night patrolling. We will conduct an identification drive, to keep tabs on people with a history of such activity. In politics, these incidents can get a different colour. As far as maintaining law and order is concerned, we will not let this be the cause of a communal disturbance. Just as people accused of cow slaughter in Tappal were charged under the Gangster Act, we will, after investigations, slap similar charges on the accused in this case too,” Goud said.

Samajwadi Party leader Ajju Ishaq, also city president of the party, said, “This case just played into the hands of the BJP. This was another attempt to recreate Muzaffarnagar (which witnessed riots in 2013). Police investigations will get to the bottom of it.”

Ishaq questioned how the Hindu right wing leaders were the first to reach the spot of the cow slaughter. He raised questions about the number of cows police said were slaughtered. “Why would someone risk slaughtering such a large number of cows when it would be so hard for it to go unnoticed?” he asked.

SP’s Kohl MLA Haji Zameer Ullha Khan, who had earlier launched a movement asking the Muslims to desist from animal slaughter in a bid to create a condition of communal amity, said, “It was an issue being used to polarize the people here. We have to be very careful as notorious elements are trying to give a communal colour to such crime. After Bakr-Eid, I will resume my cow protection drive. Till 2017 elections, we have to be on the watch to ensure that no situation goes out of control – that would be to the benefit of some political parties.”

Raghu Raj Singh, vice president of the BJP in UP, said he and his party had nothing to do with the incident. “This is not the first case of cow slaughter reported from the area. Religious sentiments are attached to the cow. We first feed the cow in the morning before having our own first meal of the day. Our concern is to stop cow slaughter. For that, we will meet the authorities to get this case solved in 15 days.”

NEW DELHI: Three people were today arrested in connection with arson in Delhi after the conviction of self-styled godman Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh in a rape case, even as police claimed that the situation was under control.

Madhur Verma, the Delhi Police's Public Relations Officer, said a few incidents of buses being torched by some miscreants were reported as violence spread to the national capital.

There was, however, no large gatherings of followers of the Dera Sacha Sauda chief in Delhi yet, Verma said, adding that adequate security arrangements were in place to deal with any eventuality.

A bus was torched allegedly by Gurmeet Ram Rahim's followers in northeast Delhi's Loni Chowk.

A fire also engulfed two coaches of the Rewa Express stationed at the Anand Vihar Railway Station here. Railway officials said it was not immediately clear if it was a case of arson and that investigations were underway.

A special CBI court in Panchkula in Haryana today convicted the 50-year-old self-styled godman in the 2002 rape case, triggering widespread violence and arson by his supporters in Punjab and Haryana.

Police did not rule out inter-caste tensions behind the fire. The fire could also have been triggered accidentally, police said.

A section of most-backward classes' people disconnected the power connection to the dalit colony, before attacking them on August 15.

Fifteen people including six policemen were injured in the clash. Police arrested 82 people including seven women and seven minors on August 16. Police booked them for rioting, attempting to murder, voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons, torching houses and other properties and criminal intimidation.

Sources in the fire and emergency services told TOI that they averted a major catastrophe by removing two LPG cylinders – a mini cylinder of 5kg and another weighing 14.2kg from the house.

Goods, mostly household items, worth 2.30 lakh were gutted in the fire. “If the cylinders exploded in the fire, the damage would have been much worse and difficult to bring under control,” divisional fire officer, Rajendra Haldanker told TOI. “What made our task even more difficult was the lack of an access road to the house,” Haldankar added.

While the cause of fire is yet to be ascertained, fire and emergency officials suspect it to be a case of arson . “I have written to the electricity department to check if short-circuit could have led to the fire. I have also written to the police to investigate a possibility of arson,” Haldankar said.

Poor lighting

Dean speaks

Too less, too late

Recently, 10 two-wheelers of women medicos were torched in the parking lot of hostel number two at Government Medical College. The girls who are staying on the hostel premises are now raising some serious concerns related to their safety on campus. The incident has sent shock waves through the entire medical fraternity and has forced the GMC authorities to take strong measures, but there is more to be done to ensure safety of women medicos. We explore the security aspects of the medical college which need immediate attention…The women’s hostel number two where the incident occurred, is adjacent to the Superspecialty Hospital of the Government Medical College and the land behind the hostel leads to slum area. “The fact that something so shocking can happen inside the medical college of this stature is a matter of concern for me and all of us living here. Although the college authorities have installed CCTV cameras inside the hostel premises now, the lack of fencing remains a big concern as anyone can enter the hostel easily and damage or steal property,” laments Divya Sharma, second year MBBS student of GMC.One of the reasons the students feel threatened especially during night is poor lighting across the premises. The place is also infamous for eve-teasing and molestation incidents. “We return to our hostel between 9.30pm and 10pm after attending the classes and the coaching classes. Chain-snatching and eve-teasing incidents in the evening are common here and lack of lighting across the area makes us feel quite unsafe. We have raised this issue with the college administration, but it seems they care less about these aspects,” says Nikita Gangwani, a first year MBBS student.When we contacted GMC dean Dr Abhimanyu Niswade, he said: “Students’ security is on the top of our priority list. The case is under investigation by the Ajni police, so I won’t comment on it, but I suspect it is a possible sabotage by miscreants. We have already installed CCTV cameras inside the premises and are renovating the boundary wall. The presence of antisocial elements would be checked by the guards now.” When asked why the precautionary measures were not taken earlier, he ended the conversation saying that he will ensure the safety of every student inside the campus now.The incident has not only disturbed the medical students but their parents as well. One of the victims whose two-wheeler was torched informed us on the condition of anonymity, “My parents live in Kerala and this incident has shocked my family. My father has decided to visit Nagpur to meet the dean and speak to him about the lack of security on campus. If our college had taken the simple security measures earlier, it would have saved us a lot of pain and anguish.”"

THRISSUR: Police have initiated steps for carrying out polygraph tests to nab the culprits who had torched a car and two motorcycles parked at the veranda of the prayer hall of the Church of God in India denomination belonging to the Pentecost Church Kaniampal near Kunnamkulam on March 26.

Police have not arrested anyone in connection with the incident though a special investigating team (SIT) has been constituted to probe the case. According to V A Krishnadas, the Kunnamkulam CI who heads the SIT, said that the police have filed requests for carrying out the polygraph tests on five suspects before the judicial first class magistrate .

The suspects include people who have committed similar crimes elsewhere. A final decision on polygraph tests will be possible only with the consent of the suspects and of the court.

However, the church officials are frustrated that the police have not been able to arrest none so far. ""If the police at Kunnamkulam is not able to make any breakthrough, the government must hand over the investigation to Crime Branch,'' said Pastor M G Emmanuel, who runs the prayer hall.

He said home minister Ramesh Chennithala who had visited the prayer hall two weeks after the incident, had assured that the investigation would be handed over to Crime Branch if the local police fails to nab the culprits within 10 days. ""However, nothing has been done so far,"" Emmanuel said.

A meeting to protest the delay in arrest of the accused has been organized by the Christian Aikya Vedi in Kunnamkulam on June 11, he said.

According to Emmanuel, the two motorcycles were completely gutted in the fire, while the car was partially destroyed.

He said about 300 students belonging to various communities used to attend the Vacation Bible Classes, being conducted at the prayer hall, every year.

Bhubaneswar: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Tuesday ruled out any terror angle behind last year's burning of empty trains at Puri. The NIA submitted its closure report in its special court here and said the prime accused Subhash Ramachandran is not a terrorist.

NIA said the accused was suffering from a psychological disorder and wanted to be famous by misleading police.

On November 12, 2015, government railway police (GRP) arrested Ramachandran for allegedly setting afire five coaches of three empty trains at Puri station. A native of Tamil Nadu, Ramachandran created a flutter by linking the incident to five terrorists in Mumbai and said they were also behind the train arsons in Gaya, Haridwar and Kharagpur. Considering the interstate ramification of the case, the state police had recommended NIA probe.

""During investigation, the NIA found little evidence of terror link behind the train arson. Ramachandran misled us by giving some fake names of terrorists. His statement could not be substantiated. Since there is no terror link in the incident, the NIA gave a closure report,"" said a senior lawyer.

On December 10, the train burning case was shifted from Puri court to the NIA's special court at Khurda sessions court in Bhubaneswar. The NIA has now appealed to the special court to transfer the case back to Puri, the lawyer said.

On December 3, the NIA took over the investigation after Odisha Police found suspected terror link behind the sabotage. The GRP in Puri and Bhubaneswar interrogated Ramachandran at least thrice. He underwent a polygraph test on December 7 and told police that some terrorists had hired him for the arson attacks.

LUCKNOW: The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) inquiry into the July 15, 2009, arson at the Mall Avenue residence of the then state Congress president Rita Baguhuna Joshi may have established a conspiracy angle in the crime, but the agency has failed to even remotely identify the main conspirator. In the high profile case, the scene of crime was a stone's throw distance from the then chief minister Mayawati's government accommodation.

The report states that as a part of a pre-planned conspiracy, police reached the venue around four hours before the premises was set ablaze and forcibly took away all seven individuals present there including the police gunner of the then UPCC chief. It was almost four hours after the occupants were taken away that the premises was set on fire.

The main witness in the CID report happens to be former domestic help of Joshi who was present in house when the other occupants were allegedly herded away by the police but managed to stay back as she slipped under a bed in one of the rooms. While this domestic help stood witness to what all happened at the premises four hours later, those taken away by the police were detained at the Hazratganj Kotwali without being assigned any reason whatsoever for their detention.

The 400-odd paged report does admit that the incident was part of a conspiracy but fails to detail any further. The report had been sent to the state government for further action. As per the norms, it was up to the state government to decide the fate of the report. Sources in the government have confirmed that the 15 cops who have been identified as accused in the case have been found fit for prosecution under sections 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common goal), 427 (mischief causing damage to property worth Rs 50 or more), 365 (kidnapping for illegal confinement), 342 (Punishment for wrongful confinement ? one year or fine or both), 218 (Public servant misleads investigations to save accuse ? three years imprisonment) and 120 (B) (Criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

Perhaps the district administration and police failed to take any precautionary measures even after two hours of Allahabad incident. The casual approach of officials was exposed when a group of youth lawyers came out of central bar association building, where CBA and Banaras Bar Association had convened a joint meeting to condemn the killing of a lawyer in police firing at Allahabad, and raided the SSP office.

Initially some lawyers leading these demonstrators tried to stage a sit-in in front of SSP’s office. However, other members of this group started attacking the offices of SSP and SP (rural) with flower pots kept there. When the incident occured some ASPs, circle officers and few police personnel were present there. Some of the cops came out of their offices to stop the demonstrators. On seeing it the lawyers indulged in brickbatting and started running towards district magistrate office.

To stop the angry lawyers, cops also started brickbatting compelling the lawyers to leave collectorate premises. But before running towards district court compound they damaged the official SUVs of chief revenue officer (CRO), city magistrate and ACM-II. With the sounding of alert through wireless heavy police force from several police station and PAC reached collectorate premises.

Later, the DM Pranjal Yadav and SSP Jogendra Kumar reached there to take stock of situation. After holding a closed door meeting with their subordinates, who remained eye witness of violence, the DM said that police have video recording of the incident, which will help in identifying the lawyers remained involved in attacking the SSP office and vehicles of magistrates. However, the officials could not make it clear whether any FIR is being lodged in this connection.

Yadav said that stern action would be taken in this episode that will be visible in two-three days. The officials claimed that in view of Allahabad incident necessary precautions were initiated but some lawyers managed to reach SSP office.

On the other hand with the incident of attacking SSP office by a group of lawyers a line of division also surfaced in lawyers fraternity as majority of them preferred to quit the district court and collectorate premises. The office bearers of CBA as well as BBA also avoided commenting on the incident of attacking SSP office.

GUNTUR: In a suspected case of arson whose motive appeared to be unclear, unidentified miscreants set on fire banana nurseries in six villages spread across 20 acres in the Tullur and Tadepalli mandals of Guntur district where the proposed capital of Andhra Pradesh is coming up. The incidents took place in the six villages that are about a km or two away from one another on Sunday night. The loss is estimated to be around Rs 50 lakh.

Cases have been registered under sections 427 (mischief), 435 (mischief by fire with an intent to cause damage) and 447 (criminal trespass) of IPC at Tadepalli and Tullur police stations.

While the police are yet to nab the culprits, the horrific episode has already taken a political colour what with farmers alleging the ‘involvement’ of the Andhra Pradesh government in the crime. They claim that the government, in a desperate attempt to forcibly take over their land for the development of new capital, burnt down their nurseries.

Plantations apart, several banana nurseries located in Undavalli, Penumaka, Mandadam, Lingayapalem, Moodha Lingayapalem and Venkatapalem villages in the two mandals were also damaged in Sunday’s incident. If that’s not all, the blaze even reduced drip irrigation pipelines, motors, huts and electrical wires to ashes. While locals claimed they saw about 8-10 suspects flee from the spot, police are yet to ascertain the same.

Predictably irked by the development, locals of the area are now up in arms against the government and have vowed to not part with their land at any cost. “The government wants to create panic and force us to vacate the fields and villages so that it can usurp it,” said Narsa Reddy, a farmer.

Incidentally, a majority of farmers living in villages on the right bank of the Krishna river have been for long opposing the Chandrababu Naidu government’s attempts to acquire these fields for construction of the capital city. This, despite the pressure being mounted on them by the ruling TDP leaders as well as local realtors.

“How can this government claim to be a champion of farmers’ issues when it is trying to terrorize them?” asked M Seshareddy, a farmer of Penumaka, echoing the sentiment of many others. The affected farmers have now demanded compensation from the government for the mishap.

While AP police chief J V Ramudu, who was camping in Vijayawada, rushed both the SPs of Guntur, Rajesh Kumar and P H D Ramakrishna, to the villages for a first hand report ,said that the incident “looked like a sabotage”, agriculture minister Prattipati Pullarao wasted no time it putting the blame on the YSRCP. He alleged that it was Jagan’s ploy to scuttle the construction of capital city in Guntur and maintained that the government had no intention to take the land by force.

YSRCP leaders, while condemning the act, demanded that the state government order a probe by the CBI or a sitting high court judge into the arson. “Let CBI bring out the facts,” chief spokesperson of YSRCP, Ambati Rambabu, said. He added: “It is an open secret that the CM was threatening the farmers with dire consequences if they did not part with their land. Who else would be behind such a heinous act?”.

Meanwhile, expressing shock over the incident, chief minister Chandrababu Naidu directed Guntur collector Kanthilal Dande, to probe the incident and submit a report at the earliest."

MYSORE: Come summer, forest fires are a common phenomena in national parks particularly in the forests encompassing tiger projects. Henceforth wrongdoers have to think twice as state government has decided to hand over all the cases of forest fires to Central Bureau of Investigation( CBI).

This decision of the state government at the behest of forest department and tiger project officials is definitely going to inject a sense of fear into the mind of the criminals and other vested elements who on occasions instigated gullible tribals and others to set fire to forest.

State government has taken this decision in view of the coming summer when anti-social elements will be at their best and try to destroy the forest wealth. It is said that on occasions , many NGO leaders have either instigated tribals or hired outside elements to set fire to forest cover, particularly the forest cover of tiger parks. These NGOs allegedly with an intention to get funds from foreign agencies involved with wild life conservation and protection activities conspired and presented a gloomy picture of burned forests and life of tigers in the tiger projects.

According to forest department officials tiger project officials and other forest department men were a worried lot with the approach of summer and remained on their toes to extinguish the fire. Despite they being on high alert they were unable to check fire incidents, a source said , adding that now criminals , particularly those working at the behest of NGOs will hesitate to indulge in this destructive activity as they will be scared of getting exposed.

Confirming the decision, Bandipur tiger project director and CCF H C Kantharaju welcomed the move as criminals, particularly the conspirators will think twice on the issue. ""We have taken a decision on the issue last month and henceforth all cases of arson will be handed over to CBI directly without waiting or seeking the nod of state government"" he revealed and optimistically added: now organized forest fires will be the things of the past"" he added. Even government is planning to hand over the major incidents of forest crimes to CBI, but now initially CBI will investigate and handle the arson cases in forest areas, particularly in state’s five project tiger areas. DEED chief Srikanth welcomed the decision , but he questioned the forest officials claim on NGOs. Forest department officials instead of making surpassing remarks against NGOs should set right their house in order where internal rivalry among the officials is also one of the prime reason behind the forest fires."

NEW DELHI: Till riots broke out in 1984, blocks 30 and 32 in Trilokpuri housed hundreds of Sikh families. Three decades later only horrific memories of arson and killings exist there. Barring a handful of survivors of 15 riot-hit families, most people fled for their lives when the blood-thirsty mob launched their attack on the locality. Those who came out of hiding once the situation became normal relocated to the Tilak Vihar area. The recent communal tension in Trilokpuri has revived some of those memories, prompting the survivors to once again demand justice for what had happened 30 years ago.

Kanwaljeet Singh Sandhu is a resident of block 30 in Trilokpuri. His elder brothers, then teenagers, were burnt alive near Laxmi Nagar during the '84 riots. His wife Simranjeet, then an eight-year-old who lived in Shahdara had seen her grandfather dying-he too was burnt alive by the miscreants-before her eyes.

When tension gripped Trilokpuri last week, Sandhu and his wife had packed off their two sons to their relatives' house. The couple say they didn't want their children to live in fear. Pointing at a photograph of his parents mounted on the wall, Sandhu said, ""My father died 10 years ago waiting for justice. My mother passed away four years ago-she feared that my sons would meet the similar fate. Punish the guilty and the powerful involved in the crime, that's what we want.""

""It's a very long story. Neither we can tell you nor will you be able to hear it,"" said 75-year-old Sardar Harminder Singh, who survived a murder bid by hiding in a trunk for three days. A Hindu family had given shelter. Singh runs a workshop in Trilokpuri and watches all updates on the 1984 riots on his TV.

People in Trilokpuri still point out the chowk that turned into a pyre of sort, stormwater drains and parks from where the Army pulled out the bodies of the victims. They recalled how mediapersons rushing to the rescue of the Sikhs hiding in cupboards, big trunks and under beds to escape death.

Even in neighbouring Shakarpur and Kalyanpuri, survivors come forward to share their ordeal. In Kalyanpuri's block 13, Ravinder Singh revealed how he lost his father in the riots. Ten men from various families from the block were killed by the rioters in November 1984. Mohabbat Singh (70) said the police and the administration did not act firmly leading to escalation of violence.

Kuldeep Sandhu, now a 38-year-old music director, said that the successive governments had not paid attention to families like his as compensation had come in parts over two decades. ""We needed help when we were children. A compensation of Rs 3 lakh came in the late 1990s and another Rs 3 lakh around 2008. In such cases, compensation must be disbursed on time so that people get some relief in their worst hour,"" Sandhu said.

Students alleged the main gate was always locked by authorities. “There was no ambulance and even after half an hour of the incident, no officials came to the spot,’’ said an eye-witness.

Police reached the spot 45 minutes after the incident. According to reports, students were joined by others from different hostels and they pelted stones and broke all the lights on the hostel premises. They vandalised furniture and door of 20 hostel rooms. The agitation continued for almost an hour during which students raised anti-university slogans. Students said the first floor railing of the hostel was in poor condition for quite sometime but no attention was paid to maintain it. The two students who fell were standing along the railing, opposite room number 91 and they fell when the railing gave away.

A native of Lakhimpur-Kheri, Yatindra lives in room number 95 while Durgesh from Balia resides in room number 98. Both were enrolled in the BSc first year course at LU.

PROCTOR SAYS

“We sent an ambulance as soon as we came to know about the incident. But by this time, the injured students had been taken to the hospital by other hostellers on a bike. From here, they were rushed to trauma centre in the LU vehicle. We are taking care of them. Parents of both students have been informed about the incident.’’ | Prof Nishi Pandey

But a bunch of ordinary men and women rose above the communal frenzy exemplifying courage and character. A Hindu couple sheltered three Muslim women for three days during curfew, an old Muslim offered to mortgage his home to help a Sikh whose shop had been reduced to rubble and several faceless heroes stopped rioters from setting shops on fire.When arson began, three Muslim teachers of Wisdom Valley, a school about 18 km from Saharanpur, were taken by surprise. As curfew was clamped, scary rumours spread fast and thick like a dark, storm cloud. Going home was too dangerous.That's when Ashok and Anita Kanwar, who run the school, stepped in. ""We decided they should stay with us till they could be sent home safely,"" recalls Ashok, a former Toronto banker who returned to the western UP town six years ago and set up an affordable school at Ambehta Chand, his native village. For the next three days, the teachers were sheltered at his home on the town's outskirts.The riots happened during the holy month of Ramzan. To make the young women – Arshi Malik of Hiran Maran colony, Sumayla Malik from Behet Adda and Shabina Ramzan of Chipiyan, all in their 20s — feel at home, the Kanwars let them cook in their kitchen. ""They were observing roza. We knew that they'd like spicy food. We let them make their own dishes for sehri, the pre-dawn meal during Ramzan,"" says school principal Anita.""It felt like home. Our parents weren't worried. They knew we were safe. But our neighbours and relatives were anxious,"" says Shabina Ramzan, who enjoys teaching mathematics, like the other two.(The Kanwar couple (right) sheltered three Muslims during the riots.)Not everybody was appreciative of what Ashok and Anita were doing. The reaction in their colony was mixed. Some lauded them. Some were skeptical. ""You're helping these girls. Would their families have done the same if a Hindu girl got stuck in a similar situation,"" one neighbour asked him. Ashok didn't reply. He invited them over the next evening for an informal chat on why riots happen and who benefits from them.The July 26 riots claimed three lives. Officials said 69 vehicles and 263 shops – big, small and tiny – were destroyed. Baljeet Chawla's shop on Ambala Road was looted and set aflame. Days after the incident, a Muslim mason approached him as he was surveying the damage. Expressing dismay and grief at what had transpired, he told Chawla: ""I got my home registered sometime back. These are the papers. Please take them and get a loan."" Chawla remembers: ""I was surprised and touched at his kindness and generosity.""Timber merchant Jerry Bajaj's shop on Idgah Road, escaped arson. ""Rioters wanted to set it on fire. But other Muslims in the area stopped them. You know, there are nice people in every community,"" he says."

LUCKNOW: State government on Thursday put on hold further talks with farmers to acquire land for extension of the NTPC power plant in Tanda , a day after arson and rioting rocked the tehsil over acquisition of land for the proposed project. Government sources said district administration would take into account video recording of the incident to nab persons involved in the crime.

Speaking to TOI, District magistrate, Ambedkarnagar , Vivek, said that the rioting took place when they were discussing the issue with farmers' representatives and BJP MP Hari Om Pandey . Former BSP MP Rakesh Pandey was also present then. “Suddenly, rumour spread that people’s representatives had been arrested. This was not true,” he said. Vivek said they had suspended all talks with farmers until the issue settles down.

Farmers had resorted to stone pelting hitting a police officer in his eye. In response, police ordered cane charge on the agitating farmers. At least 12 farmers were injured in the incident. According to reports, nine farmers of Samhariya village in Tanda were reportedly called up by the district administration for talks over the land acquisition for the proposed project. Rumours, however, spread that the farmers have been taken into custody by the police and an agitated group of farmers blocked the main Faizabad Tanda highway. A women station officer, Nisha Shukla, who was passing by was chased by the mob. Soon, police started arresting some of the agitating farmers.

Earlier this month, the district administration of Ambedkaranagar had taken into account two villages to acquire land of around 750 farmers. State government plans to acquire nine villages in and around Tanda tehsil to pave way for extension of 440MW thermal power plant. The plant is proposed to be expanded to 1360MW.

Land compensation was given to farmers in June last year. A notification of formal acquisition was issued before we went ahead with the process. Vivek said compensation has been provided as per the norms of the state government.

The ambitious project was proposed to be expanded to 1360MW eight years ago, but land acquisition was key constraint. NTPC carried out preliminary studies in 2006 for expansion of the project. The company had said accommodating different unit configurations would not be feasible until more area was acquired for the project. Subsequently, the aspect of availability of additional area adjacent to the existing 440MW plant was explored.

MUZAFFARPUR: An angry mob from Bhikhanpur village under Ahiyapur police station set some shops and vehicles in front of SSB camp near SK Medical College Hospital afire and blocked NH-77 and NH-56 for about four hours in protest against the cold-blooded murder of Bhikhanpur PACS president, Garibnath Sah around midnight last night.

Ahiyapur police have lodged an FIR against three persons including Surendra Prasad, Ajay Kumar Singh and Guddu Singh on the statement of deceased's son, Sonu Kumar who has alleged that his father has been murdered by all the three persons engaged in property dealings and money lending business. Police sources revealed that Sah was also doing the same business and some differences among them might have led to his murder.

Sah's body was recovered near the medical college boundary wall soon after the murder. Apparently, he had been shot at his temple (head) and a towel was tied around his neck. It is believed that the assailants first tried to strangulate him and then, on failure to do so, was shot from close range. He died on the spot. The post-mortem examination was done at SKMCH on Tuesday afternoon.

As soon as the news of his death reached Bhikhanpur locality, a large number of villagers attacked the house of Guddu Singh and ransacked it. Then, they rushed to the market belonging to another accused, Ajay Kumar Singh and set afire some vehicles and woods kept inside the motor repairing garage, which too is said to be belonging to Ajay. Two four-wheelers and a similar number of motorcycles kept there for repairing or servicing were also burned in the arson. Another mob went to the junction and NH connecting Muzaffarpur to Darbhanga and Sitamarhi and blocked both of them.

The mob fury relented only when a policemen led by Town DSP, DSP East and ASP (operations) reached there and convinced the villagers of police action immediately. They assured them that all the three accused named in the FIR would be nabbed as soon as possible.

District Chhatra RJD president, Chandan Kumar said the villagers have given a deadline of only 24 hours to the police to arrest the culprits or else a further violence may have disastrous consequences. Ahiyapur PS SHO said raids are continuously going on against the accused persons but they have gone into hiding. The SHO hoped that all of them would be nabbed or they would be forced to surrender before police as soon as possible.

NAGPUR: A simmering tension between two powerful families, going back several years, erupted into a bloody war after some members of the Yadav family allegedly shot dead a youngster from the Gupta family at Deolapar, around 65km from Nagpur on Wednesday, triggering a violent reaction.

Irked by the murder of 25-year-old Dhanesh Gupta, protesters set afire two police vans and six other vehicles, a house and staged a road blockade for three hours. Due to the protest, Nagpur rural police resorted to a mild lathicharge to control the mob. The situation was tense until late Wednesday night, with unconfirmed reports claiming that a curfew had been clamped in the town near Ramtek.

Dhanesh was a building contractor and a Shiv Sena activist. His younger brother Smit was seriously injured in the attack. The incident took place around 4.30pm at Paoni, around 7km from Deolapar.

Police arrested main accused Indal Yadav along with his relatives Makhkmal Singh Yadav, Tufan Yadav, Jai Singh Yadv, Premlal Yadav, Sunil Yadav and Nilu Yadav. Cops said that the murder took place over rivalry between the two families, Yadavs and Guptas. The Guptas stay at Deolapar while the Yadavs at Chorbahuli.

Police said the powerful families had been trying to control Deolapar and had been at loggerheads for years. There had been several fights between them, resulting in police complaints and counter-complaints even over frivolous issues.

It was one such trivial issue that snowballed into Wednesday's mayhem.

Dhanesh picked up a quarrel with Indal Yadav over parking of a vehicle in the market area at Paoni in the afternoon. Dhanesh had his office at Paoni while Smit owned a mobile phone store in the same village. After the argument with Yadav, Dhanesh went to Smit's shop. While he was there, a group of people appeared on the scene and fired at him. Smit was also attacked with a sharp weapon. Dhanesh died on the spot.

Dhanesh was declared brought dead at a private hospital at Shankar Nagar Square and Smit is undergoing treatment at the same hospital.

The firing plunged the area into chaos. Enraged over Dhanesh's death, his relatives and supporters immediately set fire to a part of Yadav's residence at Chorbahuli. Protesters, which sources claimed to be in the thousands, also set afire van of Paoni DySP, a police van at Paoni and six vehicles of the Yadav family at Charbahuli.

Police could not reach the murder spot quickly as protesters had staged a road blockade at Paoni and even blocked the road at Deolapar. Though the protesters cleared the road at Paoni, the rasta roko at Deolapar and Paoni continued for hours.

Villagers said that the Gupta family members were baying for blood and the Yadavs had gone absconding.

Police teams from Bhandara, Nagpur and Parseoni were rushed in to control the situation. Till late night, police were searching for the accused and a tight bandobast was set up at Devlapar and Paoni village.

Although sources said that curfew had been imposed in Deolapar, personnel at Nagpur rural police control room denied this. Deolapar senior police inspector A Raghuwanshi didn't respond to phone calls. Nagpur (Rural) SP Aarti Singh said she could not provide further details as she was on leave.

NAGPUR: An irresponsible remark by a cop at Tehsil police station had allegedly triggered the arson and stone pelting at Central Avenue and other places on Friday following circulation of the derogatory WhatsApp image of a prominent religious place. It is learnt, the cop claimed that the senior inspector was sleeping after the aggrieved community members demanded action against the perpetrator for circulating the image.

One of the protesters, who had marched to the police station along with his fellow community members, claimed that they were left stunned and also angry at the same time when a cop casually asked them to come after sometime as the senior inspector was taking rest at 4pm.

""The PI is sleeping, come later"" is what the Tehsil police station cop is learnt to have told the agitators before turning them away. This sparked off the arson as the agitators decided to vent their ire in public. A reliable source said, ""The community members felt that the police was only wasting time and had no real intention to take action.""

Apart from setting bundles of straw heaps and tyres on fire, there were also incidents of stone pelting on public and private vehicles at Dosar Bhavan Chowk. Hordes of agitators also tried to target other establishments on Central Avenue but timely intervention by traffic cops from north chamber on Central Avenue, whose office is located close to Mominpura and Bhaldarpura, thwarted their attempt. Tension had also prevailed in areas under Kotwali police station jurisdiction.

Senior PI VS Sanap of Tehsil police station stated that he was present on duty but busy in a probe. ""We told the agitators that their complaint has been referred to the cyber cell. Police were also engaged in tracing the accused who was immediately arrested for forwarding the WhatsApp image to one of the community members staying at Mominpura,"" said Sanap.

It is learnt that the accused, a first year Arts student, had downloaded the image from Facebook in his cellphone and was in the process of saving it when it got circulated through WhatsApp. The student has been remanded to police custody for three days after being produced before court on Saturday.

NEW YORK: A woman who tried to kill a spider by setting some towels on fire in her apartment has been arrested in the US state of Kansas on a charge of aggravated arson.

Ginny M Griffith was arrested on Friday after five Hutchinson Fire Department units were called out to extinguish a small fire in her half of a duplex at 121 West Seventh Avenue.

Although no one was injured, and there was no damage to the structure other than light smoke damage, Griffith was arrested on a charge of aggravated arson because the other half of the duplex also was occupied, authorities said.

Deputy Fire Chief Doug Hanen said in a press release that firefighters found light smoke coming from the woman's half of the duplex and some clothing smoldering just inside the doorway.

They found multiple other points of origin for the fire and brought it under control within minutes, Hanen was quoted as saying by hutchnews.com.

A police report of the incident said Griffith told officers that she used a cigarette lighter to set some towels on fire to kill a spider.

Griffith was being held in the Reno County jail in lieu of USD 7,500 bond, the report said."

NAGPUR: A WhatsApp image of an important place of worship being desecrated hurt the sentiments of a community celebrating its holy month, sparking communal tension in Mominpura and leading to arson and stone pelting on Central Avenue on Friday. The incident was brought under control soon as cops swung into action.

The city police were jolted awake when hordes of agitators started lighting fire to straw heaps at Dosar Bhavan Square. The angry mob started pelting stones before the cops could disperse them after the sudden flare-up. Some protesters also tried to hurl burning material on shops across the road and target the nearby petrol pump.

Traffic cops at the North Zone office, near Bhagwagar chowk, were the first to react. The cops did well to douse the lit straw heaps on the road immediately. They also foiled a bid by agitators to set the petrol pump on fire, which would have triggered a massive blaze leading to unprecedented damage in the densely populated localities on either side of Central Avenue.

It's learnt that an image was downloaded from Facebook and circulated on WhatsApp among a particular group. The image reached a group member from Mominpura, who showed the objectionable matter to the rest of the community members.

The angry citizens first rushed to Tehsil police station, where the cops on duty failed to convince the community members that action would be taken. The cops had accepted the complaint but told the community members that the matter would be referred to the cyber crime cell of crime branch to gather concrete evidence against the mischief mongers.

Failing to see concrete action, the angry mob decided to launch a stir and vented their ire by targeting public property and lighting fires on the road. Cops from police control room, Tehsil police station and intelligence agencies rushed to the spot.

A strong police picket has been deployed at Bhagwagar and Dosar Bhavan Squares. Patrolling has been intensified at Mominpura.

An offence was later registered at Tehsil police station. It is learnt that a first year arts stream student has already been arrested in the case. The youngster is learnt to have sent the first image to a WhatsApp group member residing at Mominpura. Police are trying to nail down other culprits in the case.

RAIPUR: Facing criticism after CBI indicting policemen for allegedly setting ablaze houses of tribal villagers during an anti-Naxalite operation in 2011, Chhattisgarh government has ordered suspension of seven assistant police officers — former special police officers (SPOs) — against whom the central investigating agency has filed charge-sheets in the court.

An official spokesman said late on Wednesday night that Director General of state police has instructed the superintendent of police concerned to suspend/life attach these former Special police officers (SPOs), who were responsible for the burning of houses in three villages Tadmetla, Morpalli and Timmapuram, which is now in tribal Sukma district. These villages were in Dantewada district, which was bifurcated to create new Sukma district.

The action comes few days after the CBI indicted Bastar policemen holding them responsible for burning nearly 200 houses of tribal villagers during an anti-Naxalite operation in 2011 and also submitted a status report to the Supreme Court, which was hearing a petition filed by social activists. The CBI has also charged 26 others, including former SPOs and anti-Naxal vigilantes, for attacking social activist Swami Agnivesh and others while they were on their way to Tadmetla to provide relief to the people whose houses were burnt.

Political parties, however, are not satisfied with the decision to suspend SPOs, who were later re-named as assistant constables, saying that the government should have fixed responsibility on senior police officers, on whose orders such operation was carried out in the villages.

Veteran Communist Party of India (CPI) leader Chhittaranjan Bakshi told TOI “Bastar’s Inspector general of police SRP Kalluri, who was SSP of Dantewada at the time of incident, had went public saying that the operation was carried out under his guidance”. He demanded immediate suspension and arrest of Bastar IG.

Opposition Congress state Chief Bhupesh Baghel has been demanding suspension of Bastar IG SRP Kalluri saying that there has been numerous incidents of blatant human rights violations in Bastar, including the police implicating social activists, political workers in false cases.

CHENNAI: It doesn’t take a conspiracy theorist to see that the facts don’t quite add up, as they would in a blaze sparked accidentally, in many of the slum fires in the city.

The frequency of the fires, lack of conclusive evidence to prove the cause of fire was accidental, and the damage caused, all point to the likelihood that combustion is usually not spontaneous, say activists.

Citing past fires, they say the huts could have been ravaged with tacit assent of the authorities for purposes such as road widening or large infrastructure projects that are blocked by the slums. Others allege that slum dwellers themselves sometimes set fire to their huts to get compensation from the government.

Data available with TOI has revealed that 61 slum fires were reported in the city since 2010. They left 11 people dead and caused losses of more than 33 lakh. A member of a fact-finding team that visited several slum accident sites in the city, A Marx, of the People’s Union for Human Rights, said the authorities are often behind the slum fires. “They do this to make way for infrastructure projects. If slum dwellers people resist eviction agencies will find ways to clear the slums. But there had been no proper investigation to find the causes of these fire accidents,” he said.

For instance, he says, nearly 100 huts were gutted in a fire in Vyasarpadi three years ago. “A bridge now stands where the huts once were,” he said. “Many slum dwellers staying along the banks of the Cooum were forced to move out because of frequent slum fires. The proposed Port-Maduravoyal expressway will pass the area they have evacuated,” Marx said. “There should be a judicial probe to find the facts.”

Slum dwellers say that lose important documents like ration cards in fire accidents. “I can’t get free rice from ration shops any more,” said Saroja, who lives in the Ambedkar Nagar slum near Udayam Theatre in Ashok Nagar. The slum, abutting K K Nagar, was devastated by a fire last August.

However, census figures reveal that there are more slum dwellers in the city than before, appearing to undermine the activists’ theory. Around 28.5% of Chennai’s population lived in slums in 2011 as compared to 17.7% in 2001.

Sources said that there many ‘slumlords’ are even renting out huts for poor people for more than 2000 per month in areas like Malligaipu Nagar slum near the Adyar, Ururkuppam slum near Besant Nagar and Srinavasapuram.

Tamil Nadu fire and rescue service deputy director S Vijayasekar says the department says the lanes in slums are too narrow for fire tenders to enter, making it difficult to combat a blaze. Officials had identified 30 fire-prone slums near KK Nagar, Thiruvanmiyur, Mylapore, Teynampet, Saidapet, Vyasarpadi, Esplanade, Tondiarpet, Royapuram, Kilpauk, Koyambedu and Villivakkam.

Vijayasekar says the department does not investigate fire accidents. “We fight the fire and the police conduct a probe. But we always maintain a fire report, which contains the cause of the blaze. If there is anything suspicious, police should conduct a thorough investigation.”

Experts say the government should provide slum dwellers with fire-proof houses. “There are too many fire accidents in slums each year, but the government has not done anything to rehabilitate the slum dwellers,” said Vanessa Peter, policy researcher of Information and Resource Centre for the Deprived Urban Communities."

TABGHA,ISRAEL: A suspected arson attack overnight damaged a revered shrine in northern Israel where Christians believe Jesus performed a miracle, and police briefly detained 16 young Jewish settlers over the incident Thursday.

The Church of the Multiplication at Tabgha, on the shores of the Sea of Galilee, is where many Christians believe Jesus fed the 5,000 in the miracle of the five loaves and two fish.

Some 5,000 people visit the site each day, and Israeli President Reuven Rivlin called the incident a ""terrible desecration of an ancient and holy place of prayer.""

A church adviser blamed Jewish extremists for the incident and police later said they had detained 16 youths from settlements in the occupied West Bank for questioning.

""In an area near the church, 16 youths were detained for investigation in order to check their involvement in the incident before dawn,"" police spokeswoman Luba Samri said in a statement.

She said 10 of those detained were from Yitzhar, which is known as a bastion of extremists and where some residents have been involved in previous hate crimes.

However, Samri said later that the youths had been released without charge after providing statements to the authorities.

A member of the Roman Catholic Benedictine order, which manages the site, said one of the buildings within the compound was completely destroyed in the blaze but the church itself was not damaged.

Hebrew graffiti was found on another building within the complex, reading ""Idols will be cast out"" or destroyed, an AFP correspondent reported. The text is part of a common Jewish prayer.

Two people who were in the compound at the time were treated for smoke inhalation, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told AFP, saying there was ""a strong possibility"" the fire was deliberate.

Father Matthias said an external atrium was ""totally destroyed"" in the blaze.

""The church, thank God, is in good condition,"" he told AFP. ""We're very happy that nothing happened to the church.""

Wadie Abu Nasser, an adviser to the Roman Catholic Church in the Holy Land, said the apparent arson attack would reverberate throughout the Christian world.

""Israel's global image will be harmed,"" he told Israeli public radio. ""When you put one and one together, between the graffiti and the arson, you can reach a conclusion regarding the potential suspects.""

Tabgha was subjected to a previous attack in April 2014 in which church officials said a group of religious Jewish teenagers had damaged crosses and attacked clergy.

There has been a long line of attacks on Christian and Muslim holy places in both Israel and the West Bank, in which the perpetrators are believed to have been Jewish extremists.

""I absolutely condemn such acts,"" deputy foreign minister Tzipi Hotovely said in a statement.

Rivlin called the head of the Benedictine order in Israel to express his concern over the incident at the site, which is expected to be closed over the next three days.

The site is owned by the German Roman Catholic Church, and Berlin's envoy to Israel Andreas Michaelis said he was ""shocked"" by the incident.

""I strongly condemn this attack and every form of violence"" against places of worship or people working in them, he said in a statement.

""Religious institutions must be as well protected in Israel as they are in Germany and Europe.""

Taj's brother Abdul Kudos told TOI: ""We are yet to decide on the future of the kids. The boys, aged between 4 and 9 years, are being treated at KR Hospital , and, according to doctors, the condition of two of them is critical. We, the relatives of the couple, are attending to them.""

Afzal Pasha, his wife Sheree Taj and five of his sons were set on fire at his house by his money-lenders in the wee hours of Monday.

Majority of the families living in areas like Ghousia Nagar, Shanthinagara, K N Pura, RajivNagara, Beedi Colony and Kalyanagirinagara in the north east of Mysore are caught in the tangled financial web and suffering in the hands of private financiers.

Majority of the residents living in this region are working in unorganized sectors and involved in menial jobs like beedi and incense stick rolling besides working as daily wagers to eke out living. Some of them are into scrap dealing, vending of fruits, vegetables and plastic materials.

They take loans for high rate of interest on daily and weekly basis to do business and quarrel over loan repayment is common in these localities.

Haseena, a homemaker, claimed that every day there will be quarrel in her locality - K N Pura over financial matters. But none in the locality go to the rescue of others fearing repercussion. Even in case of Afzal's family there was fight between his lenders and the family a week ago. Zenath, another homemaker, claimed both Afzal and Shereen lived like an ideal couple but their only mistake, I think, was borrowing money for high interest.

Former mayor Ayub Khan admits lending money for interest to people in the region is prevalent and is dangerous development. Ayub appeals cops to check this menace which can cause law and order problem.

SDPI leader Abdul Majeed says the practice of lending money on daily interest rate is in existence in north east of Mysore. Money lenders take 20 pc interests from their borrowers every day. For instance, if they give them Rs 80 on the morning the borrower has to pay Rs 100 on the evening.

The root cause for such illegal practice is lack of financial support to poor people and minorities. According to me, Karnataka Minority Development Corporation has failed to facilitate loans to all those involved in micro businesses like beedi and incense stick rolling. At least now government should take serious note of it, he said.

AHMEDABAD : A man was arrested on Wednesday by Vastrapur police for starting a fire in his home and harassing his father and other members of his housing society. The incident took place at the house of Shankar Soni , a senior citizen, in Pancham Apartment at Vastrapur .

Vastrapur police said that Shankar's son Vasant Soni often fought with him over property ownership. On Tuesday afternoon, Vasant again fought with his father and in a fit of rage broke window panes in the house. This shocked Shankar whose health took a turn for worse and he had to be admitted into a hospital.

""Vasant, according to his neighbours, is addicted to alcohol and often fought with his wife Sushma too. She left him six months back,"" said Vastrapur police officials.

At 8 pm on Tuesday, Shankar was discharged from the hospital. But, when he returned home Vasant started fighting with him again. This time he set furniture, bedsheets and other household stuff on fire. Hearing the commotion and then seeing flames inside the house, neighbours rushed in to aid and doused the fire.

Later, Dharmendra Patel, chairman of the housing society, registered a complaint with Vastrapur police station against Vasant. In his complaint Patel also alleged that Vasant had harassed several society members in the past. Vasant was soon arrested.

In Kanbha too a watchman and his wife were bludgeoned and stabbed to death by their son. The murder, police later said, was over a property dispute. On March 14, Kanbha police arrested the son Raman and daughter-in-law, Soni, of Budhaji Makwana, the watchman-cum-caretaker of a private farm.

Raman told police that he decided to kill his parents as his father had thrown him out of the house after several years of strained relationship. During interrogation, Raman confessed that he had hacked Budhaji with an axe while his wife had killed his mother in a similar fashion. The killer couple's daughter Sangita used to live with her grandparents. They had tried to kill Sangita too but she survived.

FAIZABAD/TANDA: Indefinite curfew was imposed in Tanda town of Ambedkarnagar district after an angry mob, allegedly activists of Hindu Yuva Vahini , resorted to arson and rioting in protest against murder of their local leader who was shot dead on Sunday late night. About a dozen persons of a community and police personnel were injured. The rioters also torched several houses and vehicles. Police had to fire in air to control the mob.

Hindu Yuva Vahini is a group founded and led by Gorakhpur BJP MP Yogi Aditya Nath . In Tanda town of Ambedkarnar district, Hindu Yuva Vahini's local leader Ram Babu Gupta was shot dead by motorcycle-borne miscreants in the busy market of Adalatpur locality on Sunday night. Police said that Gupta was killed over a property related dispute. The assailants, however, have not been arrested so far.

Irked over the manner in which Ram Babu was shot in the middle of a busy market place and assailants made good their escape unchallenged after committing the crime, supporters of the slain leader went berserk. Delay on the part of the local police in reaching the crime scene after the murder added fuel to the already rising tempers of the supporters, who attacked and manhandled the policemen and set afire a police jeep.

The situation turned ugly when the Vahini activists gave the incident a communal angle. It was only after additional police force reached the site and chased away the mob that the situation was brought under control. Police said efforts were on to trace the assailants and work out the case. Body of the Vahini leader was subsequently sent for the post-mortem and a case of murder was lodged at Aliganj police station.

As a precautioary measure, the district administration imposed curfew in Tanda and Aliganj police stations of the Tanda area. Heavy police force has also been deployed in the area. Faizabad Commissioner Vipin Kumar Diwedi when contacted, told TOI that the situation was now under control. Subhash Chandra, Inspector General of Police, said that the police are investigating the murder case and riots have been controlled.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Police is conducting a security audit of juvenile homes following the repeated arson and rioting reported from these facilities. Sources told TOI that a special commissioner of police is monitoring the scrutiny and an official from the Armed Police of the rank of DCP has been designated nodal officer for the audit.

His task is to coordinate with the government, welfare officers and judiciary for collation and assessment of data.

Although police refused to share details, sources said they are looking at measures like deploying policemen outside homes to catch fleeing juveniles in case of a jailbreak. They are planning to create a database of juveniles in each jail so they can be tracked in event of escape. However, legal ramifications of such a step must be explored.

A juvenile delinquent had fled the home last year and committed the brazen robbery and murder of a jeweller's wife in Mayur Vihar. Police got a tip-off about his involvement but were helpless as they had no record of his previous locations.

The audit is part of government initiatives taken up to ensure better security at juvenile homes. The high court had pulled up Delhi government on several occasions asking for swift steps to ensure law and order at these shelters.

A HC committee also visited the home after the incidents and reported that the minors had been protesting against the awful conditions of the home which included open sewers, broken walls and bad quality food.

It had also observed that the juveniles in these homes had little access to constructive activities.

Segregation is an area of concern. In most of the cases, it was found there is a set of children involved who are influencing other minors to break the law.

Police plan to create a database of these children as they believe if they can be segregated it will solve most of the problems. An officer said the focus of the nodal officer should be to have maximum complaints addressed so that retaining these children is no more a challenge.

""Children complain of being confined inside four walls which gives rise to the desire to escape. If they are allowed to remain in the playgrounds for more time, it may help. Sewa Kutir has a big playground but inmates report they are not allowed to spend more than an hour there daily,"" said an officer.

Plans are also underway to revamp the vocational training modules so that these may attract more delinquents.

BEIJING: A former prison inmate in China intentionally set fire to a bus so that he could return to jail where food and accommodation are provided.

The 60-year-old homeless man was sentenced to four years in prison recently by a local court for setting the bus ablaze.

The man surnamed Wang said he committed the crime as he wanted to return to prison to avail the facilities of food and accommodation, China Daily quoted Beijing Times as reporting.

Wang, who boarded a bus in Beijing's Fengtai district in August, last year, set fire to the driver's seat, causing panic among the passengers.

Wang has been detained seven times for stealing and fighting in public and was once sentenced to 14 years in jail for robbery, the report said.

GAYA: A group of nearly 50 armed Maoists raided a highway construction site in Gaya district of Bihar on Tuesday and torched construction machines stationed at the site.

A propeller was damaged while the all steel road rollers remained unscathed.

The attack is being seen as an attempt by the Maoists to squeeze more money from the contractors engaged in the multi-crore ambitious road project linking the Naxalite-affected Dumaria block headquarters of Gaya district with Patna.

This is the second such attack on road construction site in the district. A couple of days back, road construction site was targeted by the Maoists near Nepa village a few km to the east of Khaira village where the latest Maoist attack took police.

According to a police officer the attackers split into two groups after the attack. The Maoists did not leave behind any note at the attack site, he said.

He added a joint operation has been launched by the local police, STF and the CRPF. No arrest have been made so far.

LUCKNOW: Police on Tuesday filed FIR against five accused including three senior police officials in Congress leader Rita Bahuguna Joshi's house arson incident.

The police acted on the orders of chief judicial magistrate and all five accused were booked under various IPC sections. Interestingly, the original order that was given by the CJM in October got lost before it reached the Hussainganj police station. The copy of the original order landed at the police station on Tuesday on the basis of which the case was registered against cops. Congressmen had alleged at that time that the police was in collusion with the mob and stood as mere spectators instead of providing protection to the victims.

While Babloo and Abdi had been chargesheeted in the past, FIR against Balram Saroj (the then in-charge of Hussainganj police station), BS Ghabrial (then circle officer of Hazratganj) and Harish Kumar (then SP east) was registered on Tuesday. In July 2009, Joshi had made some remarks against then chief minister Mayawati. Angry supporters of Mayawati led by controversial leaders Jitendra Singh alias Babloo and Intezar Ahmed Abdi vandalised and torched Joshi's house, located in high-security zone.

KOLKATA: Pushed to the wall after arresting pest controller Jyotirmoy Nandi for alleged “arson” at Writers’ Buildings, the Mamata Banerjee government is now trying to nail publications registrar Bismoy Roy who gave Nandi a clean chit the other day.

Hare Street police, in their report to the state administration, have made out a case against Roy. Secretariat sources hinted that he has been held responsible in a report submitted by joint secretary (home) Debashis Guha Thakurata as well.

The police report — vetted by senior officers at Lalbazar — states that Nandi was engaged without a valid agreement. “The firm that Nandi works with had an agreement with the state government from 2007 to 2010. The publications department engaged Nandi long after the expiry of the agreement. Second, procedure demands that the official should have taken permission from public works and agriculture departments before engaging the firm for spraying pesticides. Roy didn’t follow the procedure,” said an officer.

This apart, Roy should have informed the officer in charge of Writers’ before admitting someone with highly inflammable kerosene in a high security zone, the officer pointed out. “Finally, both Roy and Nandi have to explain why kerosene beyond the prescribed amount was used to prepare the pesticide solution,” an investigating officer said.

Probe revealed that Nandi didn’t have the required photo identity card for entering the high security zone. According to Roy, Nandi entered Writers’ under the supervision of a publications employee who used to escort him so that he didn’t move around the building.

The reason seems obvious. Police officers — who sprung to action after none other than home secretary Basudeb Banerjee cried conspiracy — have to justify their actions.

According to state officials, Roy was under the scanner for quite some time after he gave a clean chit to IPS officer Nazrul Islam’s controversial book Musalmader Ki Karaniya. Nazrul cited this while fighting his case in the Central Administrative Tribunal ( CAT ) that ordered a stay on the departmental proceedings against the IPS officer.

Roy’s track record, along with findings of the Hare Street police fuelled speculation that the administration is going to serve a showcause notice on him. The police report has also come handy to the state government to plead its case against the pest controller whose arrest has met with a flutter in administrative circles.

Police officers at Lalbazar are in two minds over the legal strategy the state should adopt when Nandi is produced at Bankshall court on Friday. The public prosecutor will thus have to wait from a last minute directive from the administration on whether to oppose Nandi’s bail petition based on the police report or remain silent as the public prosecutor did when accused former CEO of Siliguri-Jalpaiguri Development Authority (SJDA) Godala Kiran Kumar moved his bail plea despite having non-bailable charges on him.

The public prosecutor may name “other conspirators” (read Bismoy Roy) when the case comes up for hearing on Friday, say sources.

Jyotirmoy’s mother Chitra Nandi isn’t willing to pay heed to the legal nitty-gritty. All she wants is to get her son back home. Chitra couldn’t suppress her emotion. “He cried every time we went to visit him. It is piercing my heart ,” the mother said.

HOWRAH: Pest controller Jyotirmoy Nandi , who was taken into custody on charges of conspiracy to set the Writers’ Buildings on fire, is innocent, said a state government official.

Nandi had been hired by the government in 2007. This fact came to light after registrar of publications department Bismoy Roy did the plain speak and ruled out the conspiracy saying that Nandi was simply doing his job in the presence of a government employee.

Registrar of publications department held that Nandi is innocent. “I know that Nandi is innocent. I have been in this department for the last nine years and Nandi has been working here as a pest controller before that. According to the terms of contract, he comes once in a month. I have spoken to the home secretary on this matter and have also said the same to the police. Nandi is honest and the police should release him if they do not find anything against him,” Roy said on Wednesday.

Sources in the detective department said that investigators are under pressure from the higher ups to take quick action on the matter. Police, however, wondered how Nandi could enter the high security zone without an identity card.

On Wednesday, Nandi’s mother and sister went to the Calcutta high court to consult a lawyer before calling on the investigating officer at Hare Street police station.

According to Nandi’s family, who lives at Hooghly ’s Serampore, after Nandi returned home on Friday evening, a call came from Hare street police station asking him to turn up at the police station on Saturday.

Jyotirmoy Nandi was arrested on Saturday on charges of pouring kerosene on the files.

According to police sources, trouble between the members of rival communities had been brewing for the last four-five days after a Sahni boy, Bhartendu Kumar, eloped with a girl belonging to minority community.

Family members of both the boy and the girl were accusing each other leading to clash on Sunday when Bhartendu's body was found in a paddy field owned by one Shafaquat Ali.

Bhartendu's family suspected Shafaquat's hand in the boy's killing. Soon after news of Bhartendu's murder reached his family and neighbours, a strong group of Sahnis became violent and burned the houses belonging to the minority community.

Some of their men were trapped inside and lost their lives while others sustained injuries. Shafaquat Ali has been arrested, according to reliable sources. But the situation at the village is tense.

Though the cause of the fire was not yet known, investigators have not ruled out arson. It took a 24 hour firefight to douse the flames at the Maheshtala warehouse that caught fire around 6 p.m. on Thursday, leaving the neighbourhood puzzled, tense and many homeless.

NEW DELHI: Alleging a conspiracy behind the fire at St Sebastian’s Church in Dilshad Garden , representatives of the city’s Christian community have decided to stage a protest outside Delhi Police headquarters on Tuesday. They said the fire at the church resulted from arson, not a short-circuit, and was an attempt to polarize voters before the Delhi elections.

“We will stage a protest against the office of the police commissioner on Tuesday morning to focus attention on attempts to polarize people in Delhi, which goes to the polls soon,” said Dr John Dayal , a former member of National Integration Council of India and All India Christian Council . He added that there is a history of attacks against Christian places of worship in areas like Janakpuri and Trilokpuri.

Christian representatives see Monday’s fire as part of a pattern of violence against the minority community. “On Sunday, two house churches were attacked in Annupur district of Madhya Pradesh. In several districts of Chhattisgarh, village panchayats have passed regulations against non-Hindu prayers under political influence,” said Father Savarimuthu.

Several politicians visited the church on Monday. Area MP, BJP’s Manoj Tiwari, was among the first to arrive. He said he had come straight from Parliament to assess the situation and prepare a report. AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal followed. “Such acts are deliberate. If they’re being done just before elections to influence votes, I’m sure Delhiites will not accept those behind them. I have asked the police commissioner to take action,” said Kejriwal.

Delhi BJP released a statement condemning the incident. “Christians are our growing partners in national development, a proof of which is the large number of our Christian MLAs in Goa…We cannot rule out some political mischief too,” the statement read.

Congress attacked BJP for police’s lethargic response to the fire. “Instead of playing politics on a sensitive issue like this, the authorities should act swiftly to prevent a communal flare-up,” said Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee chief Arvinder Singh.

NAWADA: A rape bid on a Class IX student allegedly by the director of Nawada-based Modern English School and the police’s alleged attempt to shield him, led to a mob resorting to arson. Several motorcycles besides furniture and papers were burnt to ashes. Several mobile phones were also looted.

The most shocking part of the incident was that the police posse inside the school-cum-residence of the director helped his brothers and him to throw stones at the mob. An occasional shot fired by police personnel from his revolver to protect the director led to further vandalism.

According to the girl, Nutan (name changed), the school director, Anuj Singh , made an attempt to rape her on October 15. But she managed to thwart his rape bid and informed her parents who lodged an FIR on Thursday against the director as well as his brother, Shailesh Singh, as the latter had threatened her on her mobile of dire consequences if she reported the matter to the police. Following lodging of FIR, Nawada Town police recorded her statement recorded earlier before the court of judicial magistrate, Nawada, under Section 164 of CrPC on Thursday.

However, when the police went to the school-cum-residence of the director to arrest the culprits, they were treated to a sumptuous treat by the director and his brothers. This infuriated the people who were waiting outside in hundreds for the arrest of the culprits. The restless crowd indulged in heavy stone throwing. However, instead of preventing the mob from indulging in violence, the police remained inside.

A vajra (riot police) van was requisitioned to control the rioting but disappeared the mob continued to throw stones.

After some time, the director’s male family members came out under heavy police escort only to indulge in retaliatory stone throwing. Meanwhile, the Civil SDO rushed to the site with additional force. Despite several attempts to contact Nawada SP Lalan Mohan Prasad on both his mobile and landline numbers, he could not be contacted.

Addressing reporters on Saturday, Pacheco said that he had taken up the matter with chief minister Manohar Parrikar demanding an impartial and proper probe into the matter and went on to allege that the police were trying to make it seem that he incited the 15 persons who were arrested.

It maybe recalled on Wednesday, locals vented their ire on Mota’s house as they were upset over Mota for having rented out his premises to Santosh Pujari, the accused who has already been arrested by the police on charges of murdering Luis Baptista from the village.

“ If you recall, in the morning after the murder I had visited the site and I even rushed at night to diffuse “the situation late Monday evening when the police took the accused to the murder site and the agitated villagers had gheraoed the police “ said Pacheco while stating that people were agitated as Mota is still roaming scot free. “The police are saying that the murder took place due to petty quarrel but how can someone brutally assault someone over such a small quarrel. And Mota knew that the accused had beaten up the deceased the same night and did not inform the police and the next morning, he was aware that the dead body was lying on the ground but did not inform the police “ alleged Pacheco.

“Let the police investigate into the matter. All allegations made against me are baseless. I have been at the Maina Curtorim police station right from the beginning till date to cooperate with the police and I will be available as and when the police want me for investigation” Mota said in a statement issued on Saturday.

DARJEELING: Government employees began leaving the Hills on Friday after a series of arson attacks on state-owned properties in Darjeeling , precipitating an administrative crisis on the eve of the indefinite strike.

Fears of a spurt in violence also fuelled the panic as GJM youth activist Saroj Tamang was found murdered in Phoobsering, the tea estate in Darjeeling Sadar, and a Trinamool Congress activist was identified as the prime suspect. The government has already sent five companies of central forces to Darjeeling anticipating trouble as the GJM enforces the indefinite strike from Saturday to renew its Gorkhaland movement.

A VIP room and the dining hall were gutted.

The guest house and range office in nearby Rimbick were also set ablaze but officials managed to put out the flames before they could cause serious damage. A police camp at Pokhriabong was burnt down, leaving a constable with serious burn injuries. Complaints of vandalism in the tourist retreats of Rangli Rangliat and Rimbick-Lodhoma were also filed with the police. A GJM supporter was arrested. Miscreants also torched a vehicle in which NHPC officials were travelling at Mungpo.

The panic exodus on Friday morning after the overnight attacks prompted Writers’ Buildings to issue a diktat to officials to stay put. Home secretary Basudeb Banerjee ordered district magistrates and police chiefs in the region to provide security to government employees and step up vigil around state-owned properties and installations.

“I was informed about some miscreants setting fire to Takdah guest house at 12.30am yesterday. I immediately informed the fire brigade and police station and reached the guest house. A VIP room and the dining hall were completely damaged but we managed to save other infrastructure,” said B R Sewa, the Darjeeling DFO.

HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority ( HMDA ) has suspended two employees - junior planning officer T Prasanna and administrative officer (in-charge) Surya Prakash - suspecting their role in the recent fire accident at its zonal office in Shankarpally on Monday morning.

As many as 490 files were gutted in the fire accident at the zonal office. Most files pertained to the Building Regularization Scheme, Layout Regularization Scheme and building permissions.

""The two employees were placed under suspension as they went to the office on a holiday (Sunday) without permission along with some unauthorized persons,"" HMDA secretary B Rama Rao told TOI.

Official and police sources said JPO Prasanna, who was working at Shankarpally zonal office, was transferred to the head office on June 1 on the allegations of misuse of demand drafts of BPS and LRS.

There were allegations that some staff utilized the demand drafts for more than one file resulting in huge loss to the authority. HMDA commissioner Neerabh Kumar Prasad had ordered an inquiry by the planning director, who was supposed to conduct the probe on Tuesday, to check the veracity of the allegations. Though Prasanna was transferred to the head office a week ago, he went back to the zonal office again, that too on a holiday.

Source said the JPO, administrative officer Surya Prakash along with four others -Naresh, Ramana, Venkataiah and Sekhar- spent about four hours on Sunday evening at the office and searched for some files. They left the office at 7.30pm and the fire broke out in the wee hours of Monday.

During police investigation, it came to light that the duo along with some private persons spent a few hours at the office a day before the inquiry. Though some staffers claimed a short circuit triggered the fire, Central Power Distribution Company Limited ( CPDCL ) officials claimed there was no power in the area in the early hours of Monday and ruled out the electrical short circuit theory. Police have recorded the statement of the office watchman.

Meanwhile, the officials have decided to rebuild all the files that were burnt in the fire accident. The HMDA director (planning) has been asked to complete the process as soon as possible.

A mob of around 200 people allegedly burnt alive eight persons including a woman on the premises of a stone crusher unit located near Badagada in Ganjam recently. The deceased were identified as the three partners of the crusher unit and their employees. The main cause of the arson was the long-term dispute between the partners of the crusher unit and the villagers over the stone quarry and the setting up of the crusher unit.

Sahu was suspected to be one of the culprits who provoked the villagers to commit the crime, said a police officer. With his arrest, police expected to establish the reason behind the incident and nab the other involved persons. More details about his involvement in the incident would come to light after thorough investigation, the DIG said. ""More people are expected to be arrested in this connection,"" he said.

Police have formed two squads to nab the culprits. As many as 83 persons were arrested from Badagada village on Sunday for their alleged involvement in the incident.

BERHAMPUR: At least 83 persons have been arrested for their alleged involvement in arson near Badagada village in Ganjam district that claimed eight lives. The incident took place on Friday, while the arrests were made on Sunday. The arrested persons have been produced in an Aska court.

""More arrests will be made. A mob burnt to death eight persons on the premises of a stone crusher unit near Badagada within Baragada police limits,"" SP (Ganjam) Nitinjit Singh said on Monday.

Police suspect around 200 people of the village in Sheragada block under the chief minister Naveen Patnaik 's assembly segment of Hinjili to have been involved in the attack.

""We have formed two squads to arrest the others. These will led by SDPO (Aska) B Kamila,"" the SP said. Police suspect the incident was the fallout of a long-standing dispute between the crusher unit owners and villagers, who strongly opposed the establishment of the unit and the stone quarry at Sindhiguda near the village.

The situation in the village is now under control. At least five platoons of police force have been deployed in the village. Several villagers, including women, blocked the road between Sheragada and Badagada on Sunday protesting against the police.

Initially, police suspected that seven persons (three partners and four employees of the crusher unit) have been killed by the villagers. The death toll reached eight when doctors at the FMT department confirmed that there were eight bodies during post-mortem. Only five bodies have been indentified and handed over to their families. Relatives of other persons are yet to be contacted.

The Opposition blamed the district administration for ignoring the villagers' plea that led them to take law onto their own hands and have sought a judicial inquiry into the incident.

""The situation could have been averted if the government had taken precautionary measures to avoid a flare-up, particularly when they were aware of the dispute between the villagers and crusher owners,"" former deputy speaker and BJP leader Ram Chandra Panda , Congress Committee (Ganjam district unit) president Bhagaban Gantayat and CPM leader Ali Kishor Patnaik said in separate statements.

It was alleged that the crusher unit owners were operating in nexus with the political leaders and the district administration. So the villagers' grievances were not addressed. ""What steps were taken by the administration when the unit was operating without proper permission from the pollution control board?"" Panda asked.

AHMEDABAD: Four bikes caught fire at a housing society in Isanpur early on Sunday. The incident provided a deadly throwback to the fire that had engulfed the Om Kishan Apartment in Thaltej on Saturday in which two persons died.

The uncanny similarity between the two incidents has got the city police probing into possibility of a foul play. City police have now roped in forensic experts to ascertain whether troublemakers were behind the incident.

Death toll in the Saturday’s incident in Thaltej rose to two on Sunday with the death of a woman, Pushpa. No less than 24 vehicles including bikes got charred at the basement of the apartment at Thaltej.

According to Isanpur police, the incident was reported at 1.30 am on Sunday. Residents of Khodiyarnagar woke up after a blast. They saw four bikes on fire. Three of the bikes were charred while one of them could be saved by the residents. The bikes belonged to families of Dilip Agarwal and R S Maheshwari, said investigators.

“The bikes were parked near the society’s gate. As the bikes are in a charred condition, it is not possible to ascertain how the fire started by physical examination. We have asked forensic experts to ascertain whether the fire started on its own or somebody poured inflammable material and torched it,” said Isanpur police station inspector D S Patel.

Sola police officials probing the fire at Om Kishan Apartment in Thaltej have made a similar request to the forensic experts."

NAGPUR: Tension erupted in Ganjipeth locality in the wee hours of Sunday after a local mechanic and transporter was brutally murdered over a property dispute . Nearby residents ransacked offices and a couple of vehicles belonging to the Baksh brothers, who have been arrested for the murder of Naushad Alam Khan Mistry , on Umred Road. The accused, Zakhir and Arif Baksh were nabbed red-handed while committing the murder by cops on night patrolling duty.

The Baksh brothers have been booked for murder on earlier occasions too. It is learnt that the Baksh brothers, said to be close to some policemen in Ganeshpeth police station, are involved in criminal activities. Local residents of Ganjipeth said the Baksh brothers are involved in extortion rackets apart from their regular work of taking contracts for vacating disputed properties.

Though property dispute is being cited as the motive behind the murder, police are not eliminating the possibility of it being a supari or contract killing.

Naushad, father of two, is a partner of a garage unit at Ganjipeth. He is also learnt to be holding property rights to a piece of land behind his garage. This piece of land worth around Rs7 crore has been the cause of several disputes among partners.

Police said that Naushad had gone to load material at his transport company office at Hasanbagh main road, where he is a partner. While he was returning along with another man, the Baksh brothers intercepted his scooter. The brothers, who came in a car, started stabbing him. They were smashing Naushad's head with a stone when cops reached the place and nabbed the assailants. It is learnt that another hard-core goon, who was with the Baksh brothers, fled the place.

On January 1, Naushad had a tiff with Sheikh Iliyas and his brother Nazir after a concrete slab fell on a car belonging to Naushad's customer, damaging the vehicle. Iliyas's son Ijaz is learnt to have attacked Naushad with a sharp weapon, leaving him injured.

Ganeshpeth police opted to take the matter lightly and settled it without taking any stringent steps. Several local residents claimed the murder would have been averted if Ganeshpeth police had taken strict action.

Naushad's kin allege that Iliyas and his family must have urged the Baksh brothers to eliminate him. The murder could have been planned to teach Naushad a lesson for arguing with Iliyas's family, and pave the way to acquire the disputed land behind his garage.

Senior officers from Sakkardara police station, within whose limits the murder took place, claimed that Baksh brothers have named Iliyas and his family members for their involvement in the murder. Their claims are being verified now. Producing them before the court, the cops procured custody of the Baksh brothers till January 10.

FAIZABAD/LUCKNOW: There was no escalation of violence despite two cases of arson and the situation in Faizabad remained tense but under control on Friday. While the first case of arson was reported from Phulwari village in Bhadarsa area of the district, miscreants set four shops on fire at around 11 pm in the curfew-bound Sadar area despite the presence of heavy police force. Two persons were killed and over a dozen injured in the violence on the Dussehra day evening on Wednesday. While religious leaders appealed the people to maintain peace and harmony, the state govermment announced that it was examining if there was any laxity on parts of district magistrate (DM) and police chief in containing the trouble. ""On the request of the administration, the members of the minority community have also agreed to offer Eid-ul-Zuha prayer on Saturday in their respective areas instead of having a congregation at Eidgah -- as it is normally done on the auspicious occasion -- as a precautionary measure and to help the administration keep things under control in view of tense situation,"" said DM Deepak Agarwal. Even on Friday, curfew was relaxed for some time during the day allowing Muslims to offer prayers in mosques in their respective localities. Curfew would also be relaxed for prayers on Saturday. As many as 26 persons have been arrested in connection with the violence from different parts of the district and 13 FIR s registered so far. Apart from heavy posse of civil police, several companies of provincial arms constabulary (PAC) and rapid action force (RAF) have also been deployed in the sensitive areas. The district administration has also appealed to the people to cooperate with the police and not to get swayed by rumours. Although officers of Faizabad district administration said that they were taking all possible measures to keep situation under control, their role is also under scanner following complaints that delayed administrative and police response was responsible for aggravating the crisis. In Lucknow, Inspector General, Law and Order, BP Singh told reporters ""We will review the role of DM and SP of Faizabad and action will be taken it they were found guilty of laxity."" He also said that the DM had been asked to collect details about the shops that were set ablaze by the mob during violence, so that their owners could be compensated. In Lucknow, addressing reporters, Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Jawwad said that incidents of communal violence indicated complete failure of the police and local administration. He produced some locals from Faizabad who claimed that tension was prevailing since the idols of Devkaali temples were stolen. Though the idols were recovered later, situation continued to be tense. ""Had the district administration deployed enough force on the day of idol immersion and reacted timely to resolve the dispute, the violence could have been averted,"" said Uttam sharma of Rashtriya Pragatisheel Morcha. Mahant Janmejay of the Shree Janki Ghaat in Ayodhya said that the free-for-all lasted for more than two hours but there was no one to check it. ""People known to me who live in Faizabad's Chowk area have told me that police were nowhere to be seen when all this was going on,"" he said. However BJP's former Ayodhya MP Vinay Katiyar said that the outbreak of violence amply demonstrated a total failure of the state government. He said tension had been brewing in the city for quite some time but the administration did not take prevention measures. Several prominent saints of Ayodhya, including Janmejay Sharan, Kaushal Kishor Das, Ram Tahal Sharan and Anjani Sharan also condemned the incident and appealed for peace and harmony. On the other hand, expressing concern over the violence, UP Congress chief and MP from Faizabad Nirmal Khatri said that it was a pre-planned move to disrupt the peace and harmony in the city. However, BJP Lalji Tandon, also MP from Lucknow, said that policy of ""appeasement"" of the Samajwadi Party government was damaging the atmosphere of brotherhood and amity in the state. He also claimed that he was not allowed by the district authorities to go to Faziabad. The newly appointed president of Rashtriya Lok Dal Munna Singh Chauhan also held the district administration responsible for the violence The state government has suspended city magistrate Tilakdhari Yadav and station house officer of Kotwali city police station Bhullan Yadav.

NEW DELHI: They had been best friends for the past 12 years until they decided to go on a foreign holiday. One was the head of a successful interior design firm while the other owned an auto spare-parts business in Dehradun. They are residents of Greater Kailash and Rajouri Garden and socialized with each other’s families. But a minor financial dispute led to a saga of enmity that saw envy, anger and hate distort their friendship into something unrecognizable.

An insult led to the interior designer allegedly kidnapping the businessman’s son. Even when the matter was “amicably” settled by common friends, the decorator’s anger refused to be assuaged. He went ahead and set his former friend’s godown in Rohtak, and his cars, on fire. It was finally left to the AATS unit of Delhi Police crime branch to nab the interior designer along with two accomplices.

“In 2009, Sandeep and Kunal, along with their families, went to Mauritius for a summer vacation. On their return to Delhi, the two friends had a fight over money in which the businessman insulted his friend Kunal, interior designer. Incensed, Kunal nurtured a grudge against Sandeep,’’ said Ashok Chand, DCP (crime).

Kunal allegedly took his cousin Nitin Chopra, alias Mani, and his friend Sahil, alias Gola, into confidence. “The trio hatched a conspiracy and kidnapped Sandeep’s nine-year-old son in March 2010 and demanded Rs 1 crore and a luxury car as ransom. But under pressure from family members and the police, the boy was rescued and the complainant agreed not to pursue the matter.

“Kunal continued to nurse a grudge. He was upset that Sandeep and his brothers earned crores of rupees each year whereas his own business was struggling. Soon he hit upon a plan and again sought the help of Nitin and Sahil. On December 9, 2010, while Sandeep and his family had gone to Shirdi, Kunal along with his associates went to Sandeep’s godown on Rohtak Road and set the place and a car on fire,’’ said additional DCP (crime) Sanjay Bhatia.

Kunal observed that even after Sandeep’s property was damaged, his business continued to flourish. On May 9, 2011 Kunal, along with his associates, set Sandeep’s Innova on fire. Kunal was under the impression that after this series of unfortunate events, Sandeep and his brother, whom he thought to be a submissive person by nature, would capitulate and he would be able to extract crores of rupees from them. But the brothers approached the police.

A case in this regard was registered at Greater Kailash police station. But when the complainant continued to receive threats and demands for money, the probe was transferred to the crime branch.

Following a minor financial dispute in 2009, Kunal started hating his friend, Sandeep, so much that he first kidnapped his friend’s son and later burnt a factory that Sandeep owned."

GUWAHATI: The Indian Confederation of Indigenous and Tribal People’s, North East Zone (ICITP-NEZ) has criticized the arrest of 65 persons in connection with the burning of a car on Wednesday at Gossaigaon area inBaksa district, alleging that the arrest arbitrary and made without a proper investigation.

ICITP-NEZ president Jebra Ram Muchahary claimed that the arrest reflected the anti-tribal attitude of the police as the people were rounded up in the most arbitrary manner. “Villagers were rounded up at around 2.30pm at the spot where the car was set ablaze. Police then randomly picked up the male members and took them to Tamulpur police station in Baksa district. This shows the anti-tribal and biased attitude of police officers involved in the arrest,” Muchahary alleged.

ICIPTP-NEZ said that it was shocked to find the violence spilling over to Baksa and Kamrup (rural) districts even as normalcy was returning in Kokrajhar, Chirang and Dhubri districts of western Assam.

Violence broke out in Rangiya area of Kamrup (rural) district after miscreants set ablaze a car at Gossaigaon village under Kaurbaha Police outpost in Baksa district on Wednesday, and its driver, Sahidul Hussain, went missing.

Following the arson incident, mobs at Rangiya torched many vehicles and burnt a wooden bridge. A district administration officer was also attacked by the mob, compelling the police to fire teargas shells.

MUMBAI: The Mumbai police will now have to wait for at least another one week to arrest the rest of around two dozen suspects accused of rioting , arson and assaulting policemen in the Saturday's protest at Azad Maidan .

On Saturday, the Muslim organisations had staged a morcha at Azad Maidan ground to protest the atrocities on Muslims in Burma and Myanmar. The protest turned violent after one of the notorious group attacked the policemen leading to police firing in which two persons were killed and 63 persons including 58 policemen were injured.

Police had arrested 23 persons on Sunday responsible for the rioting and assaulting policemen. Now police have started identifying the suspects who were seen rioting and assualting policemen.

BHOPAL: Battling for life for over seven months, assistant station master Sanket Bansal, who suffered severe burns in February 26 rioting and arson at Gulabganj station in Vidisha district on February 26, succumbed at a hospital in Delhi on Saturday. He was declared dead at 7.30 am.

Basal had sustained critical burns after a mob went on the rampage setting Gulabganj station on fire after two schoolchildren were run over by an express train that day. One railway employee was charred to death in the incident.

The Special Task Force (STF) filed an interim charge-sheet against 16 people on charges of rioting, arson and a murder of a railway employee. After initial investigations, government railway police (GRP) arrested 12 people and the case was transferred to STF in May.

In its charge-sheet submitted before chief judicial magistrate Vijay Singh , STF pointed out Saurabh Dangi, 25, and Ram Mohan Rai, 26, both residents of Gulabganj, had set the room, in which the assistant station master and two others were hiding to escape the mob fury, on fire. With three inside, the two had locked it, sprinkled petrol, taken from a motorbike parked outside the station and set the room on fire.

The trouble erupted after a speeding train ran over five-year-old Mohammed Ali and his sister Icra Ali, 8, when the two with parents were crossing the railway tracks from under a stationary goods train. The two children were hit by an express train on the adjoining track as soon as they came out. In a few minutes, a mob laid siege to the station, protesting that repeated demands for a foot over-bridge at the station were ignored. A tehsildar, who tried to control the mob, was also attacked.

Bhagwan Das Ahirwar was charred to death. Two others, assistant station master Sanket Bansal and a local Chandra Kant Singh, sustained severe burns."

NEW DELHI: Around 50 boys rioted inside a north Delhi juvenile observation home for eight hours on Saturday night, torching down the superintendent’s office and triggering blasts by setting fire to gas cylinders . In the melee, 22 boys escaped. By Sunday, 15 had been nabbed.

Police said a hunt was on for the seven still at large, who are involved in cases of robbery, dacoity and snatching.

Eyewitnesses and government officials said the scale and ferocity of Saturday’s violence hadn’t previously been seen at any juvenile facility in Delhi. The boys were on a rampage through the night at the Adharshila observation home inside Seva Kutir , a juvenile home at Mukherjee Nagar, northwest Delhi, even as a posse of 200 policemen watched as bystanders.

“They destroyed computers in the offices, furniture, water-coolers, medicines and records/files stored inside the room. A massive solar heater on the roof was sent crashing to the ground. After climbing the high security walls, they ransacked my office, used the electric wiring to start a fire and escaped. Our TIP room has been completely burnt. The loss runs into lakhs,” said Anil Kumar , superintendent of the Adharshila home.

Before they burnt down the offices, the boys pulled out a cemented cash chest attached to the wall, broke open the locks and took away Rs 35,000 cash, according to the staffers who maintain the office . Most of the boys are over 16 but less than 18 years of age. The home had 128 boys.

Eyewitnesses said it was a miracle the staff escaped unhurt. A posse of nearly 200 policemen apart from private security and personnel of Delhi Armed Police witnessed the rioting inside as bystanders. While eight DAP policemen and 21 private security guards were present when the rioting began, by 2.30am reinforcements from Mukherjee Nagar police station had arrived but could offer little help. They cited the rules in the Juvenile Justice Act and orders of the court to justify their hands off approach.

“We can’t even lathi-charge them. Why would a policeman or guard endanger his life in trying to stop a mob of juveniles?” explained a DAP guard posted outside the home.

Women and child development minister Kiran Walia expressed concern over a series of incidents in the government-run juvenile homes and said she had ordered a full report on Saturday’s incident. “Once I get the report, we will be in a better position to understand what happened,” she said.

When TOI visited the office compound and the observation home adjacent to it, the area resembled a riot zone. It was strewn with burnt paper, blankets, bricks, iron rods and stones. The agitated boys got hold of anything, from blankets to newspapers and photo albums, to light up a fire damaging corrugated iron doors used for entrance and exit by the staffers. A guitar snapped in half lay as a testimony to the violence. Small offices inside the home were severely damaged while half-burnt cylinders reeked of gas.

In the past two months, this is the third time juveniles have rioted and attempted to flee from homes run by the women and child development department of the Delhi government. On August 10, the Majnu Ka Tila juvenile home witnessed the first such case followed by the next incident at Sewa Kutir, Mukherjee Nagar on August 28, which again saw violence on Saturday. Police believe it is the same set of boys who instigated the violence. After the ruckus at Majnu Ka Tila, 10 inmates were shifted to Mukherjee Nagar, from where five escaped on August 28. These boys are suspects in the latest episode too.

According to the staff and guards, trouble began around 8.30pm on Saturday when a group of juveniles reached the terrace of the observation home and started pelting stones, bricks, even earthen pots at the private security guards inside and DAP policemen outside. Emboldened by the lack of resistance from the security staff, the boys scaled the boundary wall with the help of ladders and ropes even as a section targeted the canteen to grab hold of LPG cylinders inside. “We could only watch helplessly as they first threw down the cylinders from the roof. Some of them climbed down and set fire to the cylinders. The blasts were deafening and we ran for cover,” recalled a worker at the home.

Rakesh Kumar Yadav, welfare officer posted at the home said some of the boys leading the rampage kept instigating the others to join them. “Some of the boys unhinged the massive water heater installed on the roof and threw it two floors below. When I reached the spot it was raining bricks and cylinders. I took away more than 70 boys outside the home into the open playground within the compound so that they don’t get hurt. We were very lucky no one was hurt,” Yadav added.

Members of National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) and Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) also inspected the damage and spoke to the juveniles. Neena Naik, member NCPCR, admitted to TOI that there were no immediate answers to why Saturday’s violence took place. “They appear to be well looked after. But it seems it is the uncertainty of their future that gets them frustrated. In some cases, they were the sole bread earners for their parents, others are full of energy and want to prosper. We need to put our heads together to examine how this can be prevented. The boys are regularly visited by counselors and psychologists. Yet this happened,” Naik said."

Robawia , has urged Mizoram chief minister Lal Thanhawla to constitute a judicial inquiry to probe the arson at Saikhumphai on the Mizoram-Myanmar border and eviction of Myanmarese from two villages near Aizawl by the Young Mizo Association ( YMA ).

In a memorandum to the chief minister, the ZWO said the Saikhumphai village, inhabited by 41 Indian families and 11 foreign nationals, was set ablaze on April 29, 2013, allegedly by people from the nearby Vaphai village. Saikhumphai was reduced to ashes despite the deployment of 3 platoons of armed police by the administration of Champhai district to enforce law and order in the area.

""Leaders of two student bodies - the Mizo Students' Union (MSU) and Mizo Zirlai Pawl (MZP) who were trying to hand over relief materials and money to Saikhumphai inhabitants - were prevented from entering the hamlet by Vaphai villagers,"" the memorandum said.

It added that the leaders of the central committee of YMA instructed foreigners living in Rangvamual and Phunchawng villages near Aizawl to leave their villages by May 15. Many families left the two villages and members of the central committee of the YMA conducted a verification whether foreigners and bootleggers were still in those villages.

""The central YMA also allegedly directed its branches in the state to ensure that those evicted from the two villages were not given accommodation in within their respective jurisdictions,"" it added. The ZWO expressed anguish over the incidents in Saikhumphai, Phunchawng and Rangvamual villages as the organization was committed to protecting the lives of ethnic Mizos.

NEW DELHI: A west Delhi resident was thwarted from setting a railway coach on fire at a Jammu station on Tuesday, police said.

The incident was reported by a Northern Railway employee, Shantilal, who had reached the S-6 sleeper coach of the Sarvodaya Express, which had arrived from Mumbai and put in the stabling line. He was going to lock the doors and pull down the shutters of the window when he saw the accused, Ajay Kumar Kaushik, crouching near a seat and trying to set the coach ablaze using agarbatti and oil.

When Shantilal tried to stop him, Ajay resisted and tried to fend him off. Shantilal’s screams alerted the Railway Protection Force personnel, who nabbed the accused. They later handed him over to the Government Railway Police.

Ajay, who stays in house number 133, Rajinder Park near Nangloi, was reportedly carrying several mobile numbers of fire departments of Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Haryana.

PANAJI: The directorate of fire and emergency services has to rely on the police department for investigations into suspected cases of arson, as it does not have an investigation wing of its own.

Admitting this, director Ashok Menon said no fire and emergency services across the country has an investigation wing.

Sources say this lacuna bodes well for the perpetrators as the already-burdened police often take a long time to complete investigations. The report confirming foul play is therefore often a long time coming.

""When we ask they (police) merely say that the investigation is on,"" said a fire services official, wishing not to be named.

On February 20, one of Panaji's oldest buildings, a one-storey structure near the old Patto bridge , was engulfed in flames, that a day later appeared to have been deliberately set. The investigation into it is, of course, still on.

""We can normally tell a fire has been deliberately set because it will arise from more than one spot. Then there would also be the strong smell of petrol or some other chemical,"" said fire services officials.

Asked if the directorate follows up on establishments having firefighting measures in place, Menon said that proprietors rarely renew the one-year-valid NOC.

""This violation is not a punishable offence so most don't come back for renewals,"" said Menon.

Sources stressed that the onus of responsibility to get the renewal lies solely with the proprietors of establishments.

Even after the agitation took a bad shape following the death of a labourer on April 1, cops showed no sign of action to control the situation, sources alleged.

""The locals were instigated by few trade unions and individuals for demanding permanent and on-roles job for the family as well as kin. J K Lakshmi, in fact, hired 500 people from 100 existing families in Malpuri, including their cousins. Moreover, about 2,200 workers, labourers and skilled-labourers were also provided employment from nearby areas including Koriya, Ahirwara and others, but they insisted on permanent jobs. Though we never denied it, we would hire maximum people and train them for ITI also once the plant begins functioning. This was decided in a meeting held in December in presence of tehsildar, superintendent of police, panchayats and labourers after the locals protested last year,"" DK Mehta, senior vice president (works) told TOI.

Plant authorities dismissed the locals' allegation of their land being seized based on the promise of jobs. They also denied that the reason behind the agitation was the death of a 19-year-old labourer. Mehta said that an approximate 415 acres of land area was bought from three prominent farmers namely Narayan Singh, Anand Singh and Padam Singh on Oct 1, 2010. ""There's no question of land acquisition from other locals,"" Mehta said.

He said that police was informed on the first day, when locals had seized the southern portion of 80 acres in the plant area used for equipment storage and steel fabrication yard on February 14 and had stopped working since then. ""The protestors gheraoed that particular area and camped there. They destroyed the glasses of offices, yards and had taken away a lot of equipment, copper and silver wires with them. They had locked the gate from outside and barricaded the roads from both ends using pipe structures. As the villagers had deployed their families including women and children on the site, police resisted taking actions against them,"" Mehta added.

Talking to TOI, Anand Chabra, superintendent of police said that the police were constantly in discussion with the district administration in order to resolve the matter and break the deadlock but with the death of the 19-year-old labourer on April 1, matters became worse. ""Nearly 47 locals are under arrest and investigations are underway,"" Chabra said.

In another development, suspecting Naxalite links, police also have invoked Chhattisgarh Special Public Security Act (CSPSA) against Virendra Kurrey, whom cement plant authorities claimed to be leading the mob which gutted the factory. Police claims to have recovered Naxalism related literature during search at Virendra's house at Jamul town.

A scene of planned destruction:

Following a protest since February 14, more than 150 locals had set a portion of the cement plant on fire, reportedly infuriated over company's reluctance to give jobs. TOI visited the plant site in Durg and witnessed a number of burnt vehicles, yards and offices, which reflected that the attack was done in a planned manner as mostly those parts of the plant were gutted which resulted in massive loss to the company. Earth moving equipment, concrete mixers, tractors, lifts, cranes, bull-dozers, including a police van were among those gutted at the plant which aims to set up 2.7MT capacity greenfield plant with an investment of over Rs 1,500 crore.

""We were trying to convince the protestors through dialogue as J K Organisation did not want any use of force or antagonize the local villagers, but we probably failed to gauge the extent they can go to,"" said Chouksey."

The arrested include Iqbal Sipahi , one of the main accused in the assault and subsequent arson of police jeep . On Saturday night, a team of Vejalpur police went to Sankalitnagar to rescue stolen calves meant for slaughter. The police team found a makeshift slaughterhouse and rescued 14 calves from the spot. The exit was not as easy however. The local residents gathered around the police vehicles and eventually started pelting stones when police threatened to take action. When the officials came out of a jeep, the jeep was torched by the irate mob. In the clash, six police personnel sustained injuries out of which two were hurt grievously and were shifted to a hospital. Later the entire area was cordoned off by police teams and search for the accused started. Vejalpur police had earlier arrested six persons in the case. ""On Monday, working on a tip-off, we arrested Iqbal Sipahi, 46, a butcher by profession and resident of ward number 97 in Sanklitnagar and Mohsin Ghulam Dastgir, 26, a labourer and resident of Juhapura, from near Hajibaba ni Kui area in Juhapura.

LUCKNOW: Tension prevailed in curfew-hit Moradabad district of Uttar Pradesh after violent clashes and arson following a dispute between members of two communities late on Tuesday night. A police outpost was torched along with three shops, over a dozen kiosks and a couple of two-wheelers in the incident which left at least 11 persons injured.

The Tuesday night violence was a sequel to altercation between members of the two communities in Das Sarai police circle on Sunday night. The trouble began when pilgrims of one community were passing through the main road raising slogans which is a common practice.

However, when these pilgrims reached a stretch of the road which was partly occupied by members of another community who were offering prayers in a group, the two sides entered into a dispute over the sloganeering.

The issue was however resolved due to prompt action of the local police and that of the senior citizens from the two communities. Thereafter, district authorities assigned a separate route for the pilgrims passing through the area to avoid further confrontation. On Tuesday night, a different set of pilgrims — in the absence of any police force to inform them about the changed route — took the old route and entered into confrontation with the members of the other community who were offering prayers by the roadside, a practice that is slated to continue for the next fortnight.

Police’s failure to react in time left the clashing sides unattended and soon the situation slipped out of control. Things took a turn for the worse when the information about the clashes spread to other parts of the city leading to more arson and heavy brick-batting between the members of the two communities. It was however the initiative of the senior citizens from the two sides that helped cops restrict the violence from spreading over the region.

Authorities, on Wednesday, described the situation as under control with no fresh incidents of violence. They, however, said that curfew would remain in force in six police circles of the district till further notice. Director general of police (special) Brij Lal, who is camping in Moradabad, said that 50 persons had been arrested in connection with the violence and 10 companies of PAC and three companies of Rapid Action Force (RAF) called in from outside to maintain peace in the trouble-hit pockets of the district.

According to the government reports, as many as 11 persons were injured in the clashes, one of whom — who had suffered severe head injuries — was referred to Delhi after his condition deteriorated. At least six policemen, including two officers, were also injured while trying to control the mob."

LUCKNOW: Taking a strong exception to the reports of senior ministers visiting jail to meet the accused of the arson case, UPCC president Rita Bahuguna Joshi alleged that arrest of the two BSP leaders Jitender Singh Babloo and Intezaar Ahmad Abdi seemed to be a part of a conspiracy hatched by the Mayawati government.

""The royal treatment meted out to the duo amply proves that they are being sheltered and patronised by the current regime and therefore points to the involvement of chief minister Mayawati in the incident,"" a statement released by Joshi claimed on Saturday .

Joshi slammed, ""the unending queue of BSP leaders including senior cabinet ministers Naseemuddin Siddiqui and Babu Singh Kushwaha to the prison to meet the jailed duo, which began early morning and continued till late in the night. Both of them are being provided with all the comforts and luxury, which shows that the arrest was done was under pressure and not due to desire to provide justice."" Since all this makes it quite evident that the arson was okayed by chief minister Mayawati and her officials, there is no hope of justice unless the case is handed over to the CBI, she added .

The UPCC chief also charged the BSP ministers with violation of UP Jail Manual. Her statement specifically mentioned how she was ""routinely denied permission to meet in jail the political prisoner arrested in anti-government stir. Everytime, whether it was a request to meet Neelu -the Banda rape victim or arrested Gram Rozkar Sevaks, authorities have quoted jail manual to turn down her requests.""

""I would like to know then how could the authorities permit entry of the red and blue beacon cars and their occupants to the jail premise and meet the accused in an arson case? How could late night visits were allowed,"" she asked and added that both the senior BSP ministers, during the meeting clearly showed that the ""intention was to assure the two accused or to convey some important message.""

Joshi demanded an explanation from the government into the said illegal and irregular jail visit and stated that the leaders violating jail manual ought to be dealt sternly.

Activity remained less than normal in the hospital, the scene of violence, protest, siege and arson during the last few days.

ANMMCH superintendent Dr Sita Ram claimed that normalcy had been restored in the hospital. Asked whether the medicos, figuring as accused in the FIR registered with the local police station, have joined duty, the superintendent said that he has not gone through the attendance records of the junior doctors.

Asked whether any department proceedings will be conducted against the doctors facing criminal charges, the superintendent said that a decision in the matter will be taken at the meeting scheduled for Monday.

With RJD MLA Surendra Prasad Yadav in jail, all eyes are now fixed on police action against those charged with serious criminal offences like torching of the police jeep and causing head injury to a policeman deputed as the bodyguard of the Gaya Sadar SDO.

On his part, SSP Amit Lodha made it clear that those responsible for the torching of the police jeep and other serious criminal offences will be brought to justice.

MUMBAI: Does the Rs 25 lakh seized during an investigation into an arson case about 15 years ago exist or has it been eaten away by rats in a police godown? The question was raised by the Bombay High Court on Friday while it heard an appeal against acquittal .

A division bench of Justice B H Marlapalle and Justice U D Salvi has now asked the government to find out whether the cash dumped in a godown used by police to store ‘muddemal property’ (seized property related to crime or recovered from the scene of offence) still exists or has it been damaged or destroyed. The court has directed the prosecution to produce the cash on January 21 when matter will be heard next.

The directives were given while hearing an application filed by one Chandrakant Hande seeking return of his cash which was recovered by the police in 1995.

""Since 1995, the cash is just lying in a godown. Does it still exist or has it been eaten away by rodents? Bring the bag (containing cash) to us. We want to see it personally,"" remarked Justice Marlapalle .

Hande’s application stated that his house had burnt in 1995 and his daughter Sangeeta had suffered burnt injuries while trying to extinguish the fire. In the meantime, the investigation revealed that Sangeeta had burnt the house along with her friend Kirti Shah and Kirti’s father Jeevraj . The prosecution alleged that the motive behind the crime was money.

The prosecution clamined that at Sangeeta’s behest, some cash was recovered from ahostel in Bijapur where Kirit was staying and from her relative’s house in Belgaum. Also, some cash was present in the house which was burnt down.

After alleging that the cash was the motive behind the incident , police seized Rs 25 lakh. It was produced as muddemal before the trial court.

The trial court acquitted all the three accused in 2003. The trial court also directed that the muddemal property, including the cash, be returned to Hande. The trial court ruled that Hande was entitled to Rs 16 lakh only as some money was seized from Jeevraaj Shah’s house, so Hande did not have claim on that.

The government approached the high court challenging their acquittal. Hande too filed application in 2005 seeking return of the entire Rs 25 lakh.

Hande’s advocate Ganesh Gole said his client was entitled to the entire amount and not just Rs 16 lakh as concluded by the sessions court. ""If the appeal is allowed and the accused are convicted, then their claim over the money does not survive,"" argued Gole.

Shah’s counsel Niteen Pradhan argued that part of the money lying in a police godown belongs to Shah and therefore Hande cannot withdraw the entire amount. ""We have no objection to him (Hande) withdrawing the Rs 16 lakh, as allowed by the sessions court,"" Pradhan told the court."

LUCKNOW: Congress workers staged demonstrations at all tehsil headquarters in the state on Saturday demanding a CBI inquiry into the arson at the residence of UP Congress Committee (UPCC) chief Rita Bahuguna Joshi last month and submitted a memorandum addressed to governor BL Joshi through district authorities.

Vijay Saxena, the party media secretary said that besides party workers and office-bearers, MPs Jagdambika Pal, Annu Tandon and MLAs also participated in the demonstrations and flayed the state government's role in the crime that took place at Joshi's house in high security zone. He said that in Lucknow tehsil, senior Congress leader Swarup Kumari Bakhshi, Shyam Kishore Shukla, Subodh Srivastava and other party leaders took part in the demonstration.

He said that according to reports reaching the party headquarters the party workers staged peaceful demonstrations in Siddharthanagar, Saharanpur Faizabad, Unnao, Hamirpur, Ghaziabad, Sitapur, Hathras, Maharajganj, Sant Kabirnagar, Kannauj and other districts demanding a CBI probe into the incidents of arson.

Saxena said that in Varanasi and Bhadohi the demonstration was postponed due to sudden demise of governor designate of Gujarat Devendra Dwivedi though a memorandum was submitted to the authorities.

Meanwhile, UPCC spokesperson Dwijendra Tripathi said that the UPCC on Saturday took a decision to postpone its coordination committee meeting to August 6 citing AICC general secretary Rahul Gandhi's engagements. The coordination committee meeting which was earlier scheduled to be held on August 4 would now be held on August 6.

He said that the August 6 meeting would be attended by all 40 members of the committee including Rahul Gandhi, AICC general secretary Digvijay Singh and UPCC chief Rita Bahuguna Joshi among others."

COIMBATORE: A five-member fact finding mission led by A Marx , state president, Peoples Union for Human Rights (PUHR), visited Angammal Colony near Salem on Thursday to investigate allegations that supporters of senior DMK leader and former minister Veerapandi Arumugam had assaulted its residents and set a few huts on fire. Arumugam and 18 others were arrested and the former is in Vellore jail in connection with the incident that took place on June 3, birthday of DMK chief M Karunanidhi.

The team, in Salem to trace the sequence of events and probe the extent of rights violations, spent a few hours in the colony talking to residents. “We met the victims in Angammal Colony and have recorded their statements. We have also discussed the matter with the Salem police commissioner and other legal representatives of the victims,’ Marx told TOI.

""They (the miscreants) barged into our hut a few minutes after midnight and wreaked havoc and set it on fire. One of them caught my eight-year-old daughter and dragged her around. I was held at knife point and abuses showered on us,” Sakunthala Venkatesan, one of the occupants of the colony, told the team members. “All of them had their faces covered and were armed with cricket bat, stumps, sickles and bottles. They appeared drunk. They terrorised the people,” added G Gunaseelan, relative of K Venkatesan, whose hut was allegedly set on fire by the gang.

The fact-finding team could meet only the complainants as they claimed the legal representatives and supporters of the accused minister refused to meet them. However, Veerapandi Arumugam’s legal counsel, R Srinivasan, said he had told the team members when they contacted him in the morning that he’ll be available in the evening. “But they didn’t turn up,” Srinivasan claimed. He also refuted the charges levelled against the former minister and his aides.

The fact-finding team comprising K Sukumaran, secretary of Federation of People’s Rights from Pondicherry, A Anand, a documentary maker, Sankar and M Senthil besides Marx, also met Salem police commissioner K C Mahali and recorded his version about the incident. Later, Mahali told TOI that 19 people including Arumugam have been arrested in connection with the case under various sections of the Indian Penal Code. His close relatives and legal aid are also booked in the case. “We have also initiated action against police personnel from the nearby Pallapatti police station since they failed to respond quickly and prevent the incident. Inspector of the station, V Anandhan, has been transferred and a sub inspector, s sub inspector and a constable have been placed under suspension,” Mahali added.

Angammal Colony case, which has acquired a political hue after the arrest of Arumugam, has been simmering since 23 families, who were allegedly evicted from 20,000 square feet of land in the colony at the behest of Arumugam in 2008, returned after DMK lost office last year and a slew of cases including land grab were slapped on the party strongman.

CHENNAI: Former DMK minister Veerapandi S Arumugam was arrested at his residence in T Nagar , Chennai on Monday afternoon on charges of rioting and abetting arson in Salem. The arrest was effected by a police team from Salem.

Police slapped a case on the twin charges against Arumugam and eight others. A mob destroyed several huts and set one on fire after threatening the residents of Angammal Colony in north Salem in wee hours on Sunday.

Based on the complaint of an inhabitant identified as Ganesan, police registered a case and arrested eight anti-socials including ‘Cell’ Sundaram in connection with the incident. During interrogation, the anti-socials said Veerapandi Arumugam had instigated them to threaten the public. Following their confession, a police team led by assistant commissioner of police (Salem North) Thangadurai searched for Arumugam and they got a tip off that he was in Chennai. The teams waited in front of his house in Thirumurthy Nagar off North Usman Road in T Nagar, a commercial hub in the city, since Monday morning. He was arrested on returning home. ACP Thangadurai informed him about the reason for the arrest and he was taken to Salem by road.

Police said a gang of miscreants covered their faces with cloth and armed with wooden clubs and cricket bats stormed the Angammal Colony and started attacking the residents. They damaged nearly 10 huts and set a few of them on afire. They warned the tenants to vacate immediately or else face dire consequences.

Salem city police commissioner K C Mahali said, “After a detailed inquiry, we came to know the role of Arumugam and we have arrested him. He will be remanded in Salem prison after being produced before a magistrate court in the city this evening.”

Sources said, more than 20 families were forcefully evicted from the colony allegedly by those close to DMK strongman and former Minister, Veerapandi S Arumugam, on January 20, 2008 using his politicial clout, as the property belonged to a private trust. The property had been purchased by a person close to Arumugam."

PATNA: The violence that rocked Ara after the sensational killing of Ranvir Sena founder Brahmeshwar Singh alias Brahmeshwar Mukhiya on Friday shifted to the state capital on Saturday when his body was brought to the Bans Ghat here for cremation. Thousands of people riding hundreds of four-wheelers and motorcycles followed the truck that carried Singh’s body.

Even as the top brass of the Patna police claimed to have deployed adequate number of police forces at different parts in the state capital to thwart any untoward incident, Singh’s supporters targeted policemen at every place where they came across each other.

The supporters of the slain Ranvir Sena chief went berserk and pelted policemen with stones and damaged a police Gypsy near Shivala Mor in Danapur. They also chased away cops at Tarari Gumti and Saguna Mor. They raised slogans against state BJP president C P Thakur, chief minister Nitish Kumar and deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi and demanded their resignation.

Singh’s supporters raised slogans like “Ek Khoon Ka Badla Hazar Khoon Se Lenge,” “Mukhiyaji Amar Rahe,” “Nitish Kumar Hai Hai” and “Modi Murdabad.” They also manhandled two journalists near the Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park on Bailey Road and burned a makeshift police outpost outside the Old Secretariat. A large number of people had gathered on both the sides of the road to have a glimpse of Mukhiyaji. At several places, policemen diverted traffic to ensure smooth passage of vehicles. When the procession reached the income-tax roundabout, Singh’s supporters pelted stones at policemen deployed there. They chased away the cops and set ablaze a jeep parked there. They also damaged a mini bus and set ablaze a BSRTC bus. A bike was also set afire.

The violent supporters, mostly youth, damaged three two-wheelers parked near the income-tax roundabout. They also asked a photo journalist to leave the place.

In the meantime, policemen regrouped themselves and chased away the mob. A ding-dong battle ensued with both sides pelting stones at each other. Being outnumbered, the cops retreated and did not return till Singh’s supporters moved away from the income-tax roundabout. They also set ablaze a four-wheeler parked near the rear gate of the Indira Gandhi Science Planetarium and tore away a banner carrying the picture of deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi. Later, a fire tender reached the spot and doused the flames. An additional police force led by Danapur SDPO Anil Kumar and SDPO, Patna City, Sushil Kumar also reached the spot to control the situation.

The entire city wore a deserted look. Shopkeepers downed their shutters apprehending violence. The procession passed through Frazer Road and reached the New Police Lines on the Patna-Danapur road. Some of the youth again indulged in stone pelting there. Sensing trouble, a group of policemen fled from the spot. Some saner elements stopped the youth from indulging in vandalism. A man riding on a truck made an announcement urging the supporters to shun violence. Throughout the way, Singh’s supporters raised slogans against BJP leaders. On reaching the Bans Ghat, they again raised slogans like “Muykhiyaji Amar Rahe” and “Jabtak Suraj Chand Rahega, Bramhameshwar Tera Naam Rahega.”

SRINAGAR: Authorities imposed an indefinite curfew in Srinagar and other Jammu and Kashmir towns on Sunday, a day after the city saw widespread violent protests following Eid prayers. An FIR was registered against moderate separatist leader Mirwaiz Umer Farooq for inciting violence , officials said.

A senior police official said imposition of curfew had become necessary in the wake of the massive violence that followed a separatist march in Srinagar on Saturday that was led by the Mirwaiz, chairman of the moderate Hurriyat group, and Muhammad Yasin Malik, chairman of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front.

A first information report (FIR) has been lodged against the Mirwaiz for inciting people to violence, the officer said.

Asked whether the Mirwaiz would be arrested, he said: ""The law will take it own course.""

Indefinite curfew was also imposed in north Kashmir Baramulla and Sopore towns and south Kashmir Anantnag and Pulwama towns.

Srinagar saw unprecedented violence Saturday after mass Eid prayers as hundreds of youth shouted pro-freedom slogans and attacked police and government buildings.

As the prayers ended at the famed Sufi shrine of Hazratbal Saturday morning, thousands egged on by the Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Yasin Malik marched to the city centre Lal Chowk, indulging in arson attacks.

While the police and paramilitary personnel refrained from firing at the mobs so as not to kill civilians, the crowds went on an arson spree, starting right from the Hazratbal shrine where police barracks within the complex were set on fire.

Later, smaller groups torched the building of the state electricity department and offices of the Crime Branch of the Jammu and Kashmir Police."

MELBOURNE: An explosion triggered by a suspected arson attack ripped apart an Indian restaurant in Sydney , prompting police to investigate the possible links of the incident to a bomb threat.

The Indian restaurant in Sydney was last night engulfed by fire, which police suspect was ‘deliberately lit’ and four people escaped unhurt in the incident.

Police is investigating the possibility of links to a bomb threat at the the Copper Tiffin restaurant on Cleveland Street some time back, Sydney Morning Herald reported.

An unnamed nearby restaurant owner said he had heard a “loud explosion, like bomb” just after 11:30pm.

The explosion threw out debris and caused glass and signs to cover the road.

“Then I saw people climbing out of a window, about four, (it was) very lucky,” he said.

Two people were seen running away from the site just after 11.30pm as fire engulfed the building, witnesses told police. Shortly thereafter, an explosion was heard and a witness said the front of the shop was missing.

Police reportedly said the blaze was ‘deliberately lit’ and that they were hunting for two men who were seen running away from the scene.

The explosion damaged property but four people at a residential property above the restaurant escaped, with only one needing hospital treatment for smoke inhalation.

A spokesman for NSW Fire Brigades said around 20 firies managed to bring the blaze under control just after midnight and it was prevented from spreading to neighbouring properties."

WASHINGTON: This much almost all parties seemed to agree on. Shriya Patel took a taxi on a spring morning in 2012, stopped at a gas station to fill a canister with petrol, and picked up candle-sticks, masking tape, and other supplies at a WalMart . Then she returned home, detached the smoke alarms, covered up the water sprinklers, and dousing her husband Bimal Patel with petrol as he lolled in the bathtub, set the place on fire.After fighting for his life, he died several weeks later despite high-end care.According to the prosecution, Shriya, who had been in the US for just a week at that point, having joined her Indian-American husband a year after an arranged marriage in India, cold-bloodedly planned his murder. She had married him reluctantly, only to make jealous another man in Mumbai to whom she gave up her virginity, Chelsea Schwierking, an American witness testified in court. Schwierking and her husband, who was Bimal’s schoolmate at Texas Tech, had attended the marriage in India, and she had heard this from Shriya herself during the wedding.Shriya was also said to be disappointed with her husband’s station in life; she had expected to arrive at a wealthy PIO husband ’s home. Instead, she came to a young man struggling to make ends meet in a dead end job, even through his motel-owning family was relatively wealthy. So, according to the defense, the Amarillo, Texas-born Indian-American persuaded her to help him commit suicide, and as a “dutiful” Indian wife, she obliged. He had written depressed text messages to friends in the days before his death, including “I feel like I am going to snap” and “I feel weighted down like a branch on a tree being pulled down”.Several intriguing bits of testimony was produced from both sides, none of which fully accounted for the bizarre episode that resulted in the death of a 29-year old in the prime of life, who from accounts of prosecution witnesses, was a happy-go-lucky guy who worked enthusiastically to bring his wife to the US. He even drew up a list of things he needed to do for her (“Buy Shriya cellphone” read one task). He was not the kind to kill himself, and even if he did, he did not need his wife’s help, much less implicate her. Police reports also showed that he had tried to beat down the bathroom door which had been locked from outside after Shriya started the fire. “Why would she do this to me?” first witnesses quoted Bimal Patel as saying.But the defense punched many holes in the murder theory. Shriya had been in the country for only a week and hardly knew her way around. Contrary to the prosecution’s efforts to show her has as a London-educated sophisticate, she was actually from a working class Gujarati family whose father had been a factory worker in Dubai. The taxi-driver who picked her up on the morning of the incident said she asked him to take her to a police station more than once before changing her mind. And most bafflingly, autopsy reports showed that Bimal Patel’s nose had been stuffed with cotton balls; they were singed, so they had been inserted before he died in the fire.After nearly ten hours of deliberation, a Texas jury on Tuesday sentenced Shriya to 20 years in prison for first-degree arson that led to Bimal Patel’s death, rejecting the prosecution case for capital murder. She has already been in prison for two years and will be eligible for parole in three more, upon which she may be deported to India."

MARGAO: The fire at Sonsoddo garbage dump, that began late on Saturday night was burning again on Tuesday evening and fire service officials said putting it out could take the entire night.

Described as the biggest in recent years, the fire continues to rage even as the fire tenders once again started spraying pressured water at the site on Tuesday evening. Efforts were continuing till late Tuesday night.

The fire that had been brought under control on Sunday, was seen smouldering again on Monday and was doused after some 2.40 lakh litres of water were sprayed over it. It, however, restarted on Tuesday morning with a thick blanket of smoke emanating from the dump.

Meanwhile, with a consensus emerging that the fire could have been deliberately ignited, Margao town police have filed a case of mischief by fire against unknown persons. ""This fire just could not have started on its own,"" said MMC chairperson Savio Coutinho.

While Margao municipal council (MMC) filed a complaint in this regard, Margao town police inspector, Rajendra Prabhu Dessai said the police have sought reports from the fire services department and the Goa state pollution control board on their opinion on the fire.

Assistant divisional officer (Margao fire services division), Prakash Parab affirmed that locals had reported seeing some people with coconut husks on Monday night moving around the garbage site.

While municipal administration director Daulat Hawaldar acknowledged that the fire incident appeared to be an act of sabotage, the technical team of the GSPCB admitted that the situation was indeed ""grave"" and posed ""severe"" health hazards.

The GSPCB is expected to install samplers at some affected spots on Wednesday to determine the pollution levels in the area. ""We will monitor the pollution levels for 24 hours and then submit our report. The amount of particulate matter in the air and level of sulphur dioxide will be determined during the monitoring process,"" executive environmental engineer Rajendra Kamat told the media, adding that suggestions regarding remedial measures will be detailed in the report that is expected to be ready by Friday.

Meanwhile, the callous attitude of the authorities towards the potentially disastrous situation was clearly evident as the GSPCB failed to register its presence at the site till Tuesday evening. The chairman of the GSPCB, L U Joshi, when contacted, refrained from making any statement on the issue.

Urban development minister Joaquim Alemao who visited the site on Tuesday evening was accompanied by Hawaldar and a technical team of the GSPCB, Coutinho and chief officer Y B Tavde.

Alemao displayed his disapproval over the Goa Foundation's (GF) handling of the situation. The MMC has entered into an agreement with GF to undertake composting operations at the site.

""Claude Alvares (director of GF) should have been here to offer suggestions over measures to control the fire. Hyquip (the party earlier handling the site) had worked quite efficiently and I can vouch for that. It was the delay on the part of our government to effect their payments in time that the problems arose for Hyquip,"" Alemao said and directed the MMC chairperson to take precautions to ensure such situations do not recur.

""No money will be paid to the MMC for the first phase of the project (estimated to cost over Rs 55 lakh) until the proposal is cleared by me,"" Alemao declared, and questioned the wisdom of the MMC in signing an MoU with GF to that effect without getting the proposal cleared.

Alvares, also feared that there could be some human forces behind the fire. He pointed out that, had there been a fire beneath the garbage mounds, there would have been smoke at the site that he or other workers would have noticed, as the plastics would have burned and smoke billowed from inside. But nothing of that sort had been noticed.

Fatorda MLA Damu Naik, present at the site at time of Alemao's visit, lambasted the state administration for its failure in bringing the situation under control. ""It's a failure of the state administration. The district collector is monitoring the disaster management activities from the control room while the residents are made to inhale the toxic fumes for days together,"" he remarked.

A resident of Gogol, Rosario Dantas, claiming to have considerable experience in handling garbage treatment plants overseas, offered to bring the situation under control, provided necessary earthmoving machines and manpower were made available to him at the site. The offer was promptly accepted by Alemao and Coutinho, who agreed to procure the necessary machinery and provide the required support.

Rajya Sabha MP Shantaram Naik, who visited the site on Tuesday said he wouldn't like to comment on whether the fire was due to natural consequences or there was some motive behind it. He, however, added, ""the only thing I know is that the person who told me about the incident said there was a fire at two different places."" A fire simultaneously at two places appeared to be rather unusual to Naik.

Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco, MLA from Curtorim, the constituency that abuts the site, alleged that there could be a possibility of a human hand behind the fire. ""Maybe,"" was his cryptic comment, when asked what he thought about the fire.

Coutinho said that a fire at the dumpsite was not an unusual feature, but that it would occur before the monsoons and the rains would douse the fire. But this time the fire started several months prior to monsoon and has not been contained so far. The concern is huge, he pointed out."

The bus was torched reportedly by the Samajwadi Party (SP) activists to mark Tuesday's nationwide bandh called by a cluster of 13 political banners from the opposition benches in the parliament, to protest against price hike because of the faulty policies of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) ruling at the Centre.

In Lucknow, three buses were torched in separate incidents including one outside the Vidhan Bhawan which is deemed as the nucleus of the highest security cordon in the state capital. Taking it as a result of gross negligence and casual approach towards security of the area, the local police outpost incharge sub-inspector (S-I) Balram Misra was put under suspension with immediate effect while an explanation was sought from his circle officer (CO) Hazratganj, deputy superintendent of police (DySP) Piyush Ranjan for the incident.

Though the bandh was called by a group of 13 political parties, it remained an out-and-out Samajwadi Party (SP) affair across Uttar Pradesh.

The CB-CID is conducting fair and impartial investigation without any pressure from her as well as the state government.

Filing counter-affidavit in response to the court's earlier order on the petition of Joshi, seeking CBI probe into the incident, Joshi had pleaded that the arson took place in presence of top police and administrative officials of the state government. The real culprit were being shielded, rather rewarded with plum posts in the government. In this view, Joshi stressed, that CB-CID being a state agency could not make fair investigations, hence the investigation should be transferred to CBI.

Mayawati contended in her personal affidavit that she was not exerting any pressure on probe agency. The allegations in the petition against her are insulting and humiliating. She stated that the allegations have been levelled due to political vendetta.

Joshi filed a rejoinder affidavit against the counter-affidavit of the government. The bench of Justice Abdul Mateen and Justice Dr Satish Chandra took Mayawati's counter-affidavit and Joshi's rejoinder affidavit on record and posted the matter in next month for further hearing.

Kolkata: Police submitted a chargesheet on Wednesday against the 14 accused in the Vedic Village arson case , including Rajkishore Modi, the managing director of Vedic Reality and prime accused Gaffar Mollah.

Gaffar and his associates had opened fire indiscriminately on villagers at Sikharpur village in Rajarhat on the afternoon of August 23. Amirul Islam, a local youth, died in the firing and a few others sustained serious bullet injuries. Soon after the firing, villagers had turned violent and set the resort on fire. Two separate cases of murder and arson were registered with Rajarhat police.

Police, however, failed to trace another key accused, Azizul Islam alias Khude, brother of Trinamool Congress MLA Arabul Islam, and three other accused. Showing all these four as absconding, the investigators have charged all 14 accused for murder, conspiracy, attempt to murder and possessing illegal arms and ammunition.

The incident had unearthed how Gaffar forcefully grabbed farmland from the villagers for Vedic Reality. The investigation also confirmed that Modi had direct connection with Gaffar and his associates, who used Vedic Village as their shelter and a safe store of arms.

Police confirmed in their final report that Modi was aware of the activities of Gaffar and provided help for them. All have been chargesheeted within 50 days at Barasat court and none of the 10 arrested accused have been granted bail during investigation.

LUCKNOW: Rejecting objections of advocate-general Jyotindra Mishra, the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court on Tuesday issued notice to chief minister Mayawati in connection with riot and arson at the residence of state Congress president Rita Bahuguna Joshi.

The bench also issued notice to CB-CID, governor���s principal secretary, Union government and CBI on the writ filed by Joshi seeking CBI probe into the case.

The division bench, comprising Justice Abdul Mateen and Justice Ashwani Kumar Singh, also directed the state government to submit a progress report on the CB-CID probe into the case. Joshi had claimed that in a bid to save face, the CB-CID had booked five innocents in the case.

Directing the respondents to file counter-affidavit in the matter, the bench fixed October 13 as the next date of hearing.

In the petition, Joshi had stated that while addressing a public meeting on July 15 in Moradabad, she had exhorted the SC/ST women to refuse compensation provided by chief minister under the SC/ST Act.

Joshi further said that she had asked the women to ���throw the money on the face of CM Mayawati and tell her that if ever she happens to be a victim of rape then we shall pay Rs 1 crore.���

Though she did not mean to insult Mayawati, an FIR was registered against her under the SC/ST Act in Moradabad on the same day, said Joshi.

Addressing the meeting UPCC secretary, Kishore Varshney said that the Congress party would settle for nothing less than a CBI inquiry into the incident of arson attack on the house of state Congress president recently.

He added that the state chief minister was not bothered about the problems of common man including drought, power shortage and adequate drinking water facility and instead misused the funds sanctioned by the Centre.

NEW DELHI: Congress has alleged that the BSP supremo and UP chief minister Mayawati is responsible for the attack at UPCC chief Rita Bahuguna Joshi's house on July 15. ( Watch )

Unhappy over Uttar Pradesh government ordering a CB-CID probe, senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh on Saturday demanded a CBI inquiry into the recent attack and arsoning at the residence of UPCC chief Rita Bahuguna Joshi.

Only a CBI probe will unravel the truth behind the incident, the Congress General Secretary and in-charge of UP affairs said.

He was talking to reporters after visiting Joshi's residence here.

The Congress leader alleged that the loot, attack and arsoning at Joshi's residence was committed ""at the behest"" of chief minister Mayawati.

The incident appeared to be a ""pre-planned affair"" and nothing short of a CBI probe would be able to workout the case, he added.

The Allahabad High Court had on Friday reserved its judgement on a writ petition filed by Joshi seeking a CBI inquiry into the attack on her Lucknow residence and quashing of the FIR filed against her in Moradabad.

The judgement was reserved by a Division Bench comprising Justice Ravindra Singh and Justice Naheed Ara Moonis after hearing arguments from both sides.

While Joshi was represented in the court by her lawyer Umesh Narain Sharma, who is also the chairman of UPCC Legal Cell, Uttar Pradesh Advocate General Jyotindra Mishra and government advocate D R Chaudhary appeared on behalf of the state government.

Joshi's alleged derogatory statements against Mayawati in Moradabad on July 15 triggered a political storm. She was arrested under the SC/ST Act, besides other sections of the IPC.

Joshi's house in Lucknow, a stone's throw away from the Raj Bhavan, was torched by a mob late in the night on July 15.

Congress leaders alleged that ruling BSP workers were behind the arson though Mayawati claimed that it was ""a drama enacted at the behest of the Congress high command"".

The state government has ordered a CB-CID inquiry into the incident even as Joshi said that she will not accept a probe by any agency over which the Mayawati government exercised control."

LUCKNOW: MM Intezar Abdi alias Bobby, one of the accused in arson at UP Congress Chief Rita Bahugana Joshi's house on July 15, has been rewarded with the status of minister of state by chief minister Mayawati. A former student union president of Shia PG College, Abdi has been appointed chairman of the UP Ganna Kisan Sansthan for his `outstanding' services rendered to the BSP.

Significantly, the state government on Monday evening issued a clarification that the decision to appoint Abdi as chairperson of the Ganna Kisan Sansthan had been taken on July 14 and he took charge in the morning of July 15. The arson at Joshi's house took place in the night of July 15, hence the question of government rewarding Abdi does not arise. Further, the government press release said that Abdi has not been named in the FIR lodged in connection with the arson.

The government clarification came after a media reports that Abdi has been rewarded for the arson at Joshi's house. Abdi also told reporters that he took charge on July 15 itself and no way he was involved in the arson. The main task of the Ganna Kisan Sansthan is to educate farmers about new cultivation techniques, how to protect their crop and get best possible prices. The chairman of the sansthan gets the status equivalent to minister of state.

However, contrary to the claims made by Abdi and the state government, the sequence of events narrate a different story. Abdi is a former students union president of Shia PG College. He visited the campus a couple of days back but did not mention about his `chairmanship' to anybody there. It was only on the Sunday evening (July 19) when the news spread, Abdi's supporters took out a procession in various localities of the Old City and distributed sweets among people.

When mediapersons reached Ganna Kisan Sansthan on Monday morning (July 20), they found that chairman's personal staff was unaware of the development. They said that neither they have received any information about Abdi, nor they have seen him so far. But later after `inquiring' with a senior officer in the administration, the staff `clarified' that Abdi is the new chairman. Abdi was expected to `attend' the office on Monday but didn' show up till the evening.

In fact, Abdi was not available for comments all day on Monday. His mobile phone was switched off. However, on Sunday, he had told reporters that he has been awarded for his ten years services to the party. Besides serving BSP as a district president in 2000, he had contested 2002 assembly elections on BSP ticket from Lucknow West seat but got only 8,525 votes. At present, he is also supervising BSP's preparation for Lucknow West bye-election to be held soon.

Though the Congress has named Abdi and BSP Bikapur MLA Jitendra Singh in its complaint as the two BSP leaders who led the mob which set Joshi's house on fire, police have not included the former's name in the FIR so far. Teachers and the old timers in Shia PG College recalled how as a student leader from 1992-1995 Abdi's name figured in several cases related to extortion, murder, land grabbing, teacher-bashing, instigating violence on the campus among other things.

""Abdi did his BSc in mathematics and LLB from the college. His main business as student leader was extortion. After graduating, he also registered himself as an advocate in the Bar but never pursued the profession seriously. At present, he has a franchisee of a mobile phone company, deals in government contracts and has got right contacts in the political corridors,"" a former student union leader and an old associate of Abdi told TOI pleading anonymity.

LUCKNOW: After promising to punish those behind the arson attack on UPCC chief Rita Bah-uguna Joshi���s house on July 15, the Uttar Pradesh government appointed Intezar Abdi, named by Congress as one of the two BSP leaders who led the mob into Joshi���s house, as the chairman of a corporation which has the status of a minister of state. Abdi will head UP Ganna Sansthan for his ������outstanding services������ to BSP.

The state government announced that the order to appoint Abdi was issued on July 14 and must not be seen as any kind of ������reward������. Apparently, while Congress filed a complaint against Abdi and BSP MLA from Bikapur Jitendra Singh, Abdi���s name does not figure in the FIR lodged with the police. Denying any role in the arson, Abdi said his appointment was made before July 15. But nobody in the sansthan was aware of his appointment until Monday morning. When asked, the employees first said Vinay Shakya is the chairman but, after clarifying with senior officers, said Abdi is the new incumbent.

Interestingly, the personal staff of Ganna Sansthan chairman was told by officers in the state administration that Abdi might attend office on Monday, but he didn���t arrive until the evening, triggering speculation over ���status��� of new chairman.

At Shia PG College, where Abdi was once a student leader, the staff said Abdi made no mention of his appointment during a visit a couple of days back. ������He told us Congress has named him as an accused in arson case and he might be arrested. But he didn���t tell us he has been granted status of a minister of state,������ said a senior teacher.

Besides serving BSP district president in 2000, Abdi had contested 2002 polls from Lucknow West but lost miserably. He is currently supervising party���s preparation for Lucknow West by-election.

Talking to journalists earlier, Abdi had said he has a clean track record and had no reason to indulge in arson at Joshi���s house. Old timers at Shia PG College recalled that Abdi���s name figured in several cases relating to extortion, murder, instigating violence on campus between 1992-95.

������Abdi did his BSc in mathematics and LLB from the college. He was a student leader and an extortionist. After graduating, he also registered himself as an advocate but never pursued the profession. He is now a franchisee of a mobile phone company and deals in government contracts,������ said a former student union leader."

LUCKNOW: When Guddu Yadav, Shiv Kumar and Inder Singh entered into a brawl and were brought to the Cantonment police station on Wednesday night, they had hardly any inkling that their encounter with the police will mark the start of their `criminal career'. The situation was no different for Susajit and Zameer Khan who were rounded up for a street brawl. On Thursday, all the five landed in the Lucknow district jail as accused in arson incident that took place at the house of Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) president Rita Bahuguna Joshi late on Wednesday night.

""We were present at the Cantonment police station when the cops took them away for a medical examination around 11 pm. When they failed to return till well past midnight, we got concerned but no one told us anything till around 11 am the next morning,"" said Pushpa, wife of Shiv Kumar, while talking to TOI. A resident of Mohanlalganj and a tempo driver by profession, Shiv Kumar had come to visit his brother-in-law Guddu Yadav at the latter's Neelmatha residence on Wednesday evening when Guddu picked up a quarrel with his next-door neighbour Inder Singh.

""The dispute was about the drain water that passes from the front portion of the house. Guddu had asked Inder to get the drain repaired as it was situated in front of his house, but the latter was unwilling,"" recollected Sanjay, a neighbour of Guddu Yadav. A heated argument that ensued between them turned into a fist fight as Guddu was joined by Shiv Kumar. While the exchange of blows was underway, cops from the Cantonment police station reached the site and took them to the police station, Sanjay told TOI.

""We followed them to the police station and stood there at the gates till the cops took them away in a jeep saying that they will return after medical examination. But they didn't. It was well in the morning that we came to know that the three had been sent to jail for arson,"" Pushpa said.

Zameer and Susajit's case is all the more surprising. Working as an agent with an automobile company in Hazratganj, Zameer left his house in Nai Basti area around 9 pm on Wednesday telling his mother that he was going to Dehradun for company's work. He was waiting at the tempo stand in Hazratganj when he met a friend and both started to chat. Just then a youth passing from the scene bumped into Zameer. A heated argument that took place, turned violent. Police arrived at the scene took the two away, said Zameer's cousin Laiq.

""The irony is that Zameer's engagement has been fixed for Saturday. With the kind of IPC sections that the cops have slapped on them, there is hardly any scope for him to be out on bail by then,"" lamented Laiq.

According to incharge of the Hussainganj police station, Inspector BR Saroj, all the five were arrested while indulging in arson at the house of the UPCC chief. ""They were caught red-handed and I myself nabbed them,"" he said, adding that he was the complainant of the case.

Booked under sections 147 (Punishment for rioting), 504 (Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace), 506 (criminal intimidation), 427 (mischief causing damage to property) and 436 (mischief by fire explosive substance with intent to destroy house etc) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the five were sent to jail."

BEGUSARAI: Incidents of arson marred the day after angry traders took to the streets here on Tuesday to protest the killing of two traders, Chandan and Kundan (both brothers) on Monday.

Police had a tough time in controlling the situation in the morning, as angry traders joined by workers of various political parties disrupted traffic near Har-Har Mahadeo Chowk on NH-31. Angry protesters placed the bodies of the victims on the road, demanding that CM Nitish Kumar come to the spot to deliver justice to the victims' families.

Around midday senior administrative and police officials, including Munger DIG Amit Kumar, Begusarai DM Jeetendra Srivastava and SP P Kannan persuaded the protesters to lift the blockade. Ths DIG said police have already been reinforced with additional forces apart from two additional police outposts that would also be set up.

Markets remained closed in the town after various trade organizations issued a bandh call over the issue.

Car-borne criminals had shot dead Chandan (27) and Kundan (25) in front of their house while returning home after closing the family jewellery shop at Mugeriganj locality.

Begusarai SP P Kannan said the killings are connected to a long-running dispute between the victims' family and one Rajendra Poddar over a one-and-a-half cottah plot of land. However, about three months ago, the Supreme Court passed a ruling in favour of the victims' family, helping mount the pressure on Rajendra to vacate the plot.

Kannan said police had evidence of Rajendra's involvment in the crime as his pair of spectacles and slippers were found from the incident site.

He said an FIR has been lodged against a dozen persons in this connection with the police arresting three of them so far.

Meanwhile, tension again flared up early on Tuesday after a mob set Rajendra's house on fire. Rajendra used to reside with his family in a house on the disputed plot of land just opposite that of the victims. All his family members are absconding after the incident."

Fire fighters had managed to extinguish the fire which had caused significant damage to a temporary building positioned close to the temple.

Scotland Yard who are calling it a serious case of arson said ""Officers are appealing to anyone who may have seen anything suspicious or anyone outside of the gates of the Temple or inside the Cowley Recreation Park next to the Temple, in the early hours of Tuesday to contact them"".

Detective Richard Turner from Hillingdon Police said ""From our initial enquiries it would appear that the intended building in this arson was the Portakabin outside the Hindu Temple rather than the Temple itself.

LUCKNOW: Reacting to the acquittal of Dr KK Singh and Dr RK Gupta in an incident of arson at the medical university, some faculty members are now pointing an accusing finger at the investigating agencies for messing up the case.

""If Dr Singh and Dr Gupta did not lead a group of medicos protesting the accidental death of Dr Deepak Agarwal and setting fire to the university's property then who were the perpetrators,"" the faculty members asked.

Eighteen months after the arson triggered by Dr Deepak’s death during the medical university’s (MU) centenary year celebrations on January 11, 2006, Dr Singh and Dr Gupta, the two main accused, were given a clean chit by a fast track court in Lucknow on Thursday. Dr Singh and Dr Gupta say that they were falsely implicated.

""The question as to who was responsible for the arson in which property worth lakhs and valuable documents were gutted remains unanswered,"" asked a senior administrative officer. TOI spoke to V-C Prof Hari Gautam, who said, ""I have no idea about the incident. It all happened much before I took charge. I am hearing from you about it for the first time.""

The students torched two four-wheelers and set afire offices in the administrative block, including the White Hall, ransacked the administrative office of erstwhile King George’s University of Dental Science (KGDUS) and vice-chancellor's residence. They even paralysed medical services.

The medical university turned into a military cauldron with PAC and RAF jawans all over.

Later, governor TV Rajeswar ordered a probe into the incident. The committee submitted its report after weeks of work and analysis.

It recommended reforms in the hospital and action against the wrong-doers. The investigation was done by the Lucknow Police on one hand and medical university authorities on another.

""If Dr KK Singh and Dr RK Gupta are not the wrong-doers, then who is the culprit. If investigating agencies fail to answer this question, its a shame on them,"" said a senior professor in the medical university’s medicine department.

While the then KGUDS V-C Prof CP Govila believed that things appeared to have been done in a well-planned manner, Prof Mahendra Bhandari, the then V-C of KGMU too believed in an insider theory.

Their belief stemmed from the fact that the mob was fully-prepared to ransack the administrative block. The rioters were carrying country-made pistols and cans containing petrol to set afire offices and vehicles.

Significantly, confidential records of purchase and examinations were gutted in the fire.

""An ordinary student cannot do such things. The students on their part too were shocked to see the rooms gutted in fire,"" recalled an assistant professor.

""The students were no doubt instigated. A handful of students, who had failed in the MBBS examinations cashed in on the sentiments after being provoked by an assistant professor supported by a couple of senior teachers, who wanted to settle scores with the then V-C Prof Bhandari,"" said a professor. He added that the wrong doer must be identified and penalised."

Four persons who sustained burns while torching the school premises, where the rape took place, were rushed to Delhi's Safdarjang Hospital.

The blockade was lifted only after a police reinforcement was sent to the spot. The rape took place on Monday. An anonymous caller had informed the girl's father that his daughter was unwell in the school.

When the worried father, a native of Purquazipur village, reached the school, he found the school gate locked from outside. With the help of others he broke open the gate and found his daughter in an unconscious state.

He took his daughter to a local doctor who confirmed that the girl had been raped. On Tuesday morning he took his daughter to the district hospital along with some local people.

As the news of the rape spread, hundreds of residents took to the streets. Tempers ran high. The mob torched the school holding the school management responsible for the rape.

LUCKNOW: The Aligarh Muslim University executive council on Monday ordered closure of the institution sine die following large scale violence and arson by students in protest against the murder of an engineering student late on Sunday night.

Asking students to vacate their hostels within two days, the council said the incidents of murder, violence and arson would be investigated by a retired Supreme Court judge to dispel charges that the AMU administration was lax.

Trouble broke out on the campus when students went to the house of vice-chancellor P K Abdul Aziz protesting against the murder of BSc 2nd year student Mazhar Naeem of Ghaziabad, and found the vice-chancellor wasn't home.

This angered the students who then broke into his house and set the furniture on fire. They also went to the office

of the proctor Muzaffar Ali Siddiqui and ransacked it before they attacked the recreation building.

""Arson and violence engulfed different pockets of the campus as the news of the murder spread,"" Jasim Mohammed, an AMU student, told TOI over phone. ""The situation turned tense as students gathered for the sehri (meal before the start of roza). However, deployment of Rapid Action Force and PAC personnel helped contain the situation,"" he said.

According to sources, Naeem apparently headed for his room in Aftab Hostel around 11.15 pm on Sunday after tarawi (special Ramzan) prayers — but, he was found lying unconscious with head injuries near the hostel gate by some inmates, who rushed him to Jawaharlal Medical College and Hospital where he was declared brought dead.

Doctors suspect Naeem had been hit by a blunt object. SSP, Aligarh, Raghuvir Lal said police were probing the reasons which could have led to the murder. ""We've formed a team of officers to investigate the murder but our immediate focus is on restoring peace on the campus.""

A senior AMU official said the Centre would be requested to order a CBI probe into the third incident of murder on the campus, since April. AMU spokesman Rahat Abrar said the motive behind Naeem's killing was not known."

LUCKNOW: CB-CID magistrate Abid Shamim on Monday ordered release of five accused who are in jail in connection with arson and riot at the house of UP Congress Committee chief Rita Bahuguna Joshi, on personal bond and a surety of Rs 20,000.

Guddu Yadav, Shiv Kumar Singh, Indu Singh alias Pappu, Zamir Khan, Surajjit Kumar Tiwari had been booked by the CB-CID for indulging in arson and riot on July 15. A servant of Joshi lodged an FIR in this connection alleging involvement of some BSP leaders/politicians and police officers. After a nation-wide outrage over the case, the state government handed over the probe to the CB-CID. It arrested the said accused and put them behind bars.

On Monday, arguing on behalf of the accused, advocate GN Shukla said that there was no evidence against the accused. Till date, the CB-CID had not been able to collect even an iota of evidence against them. Therefore, the remand of the accused should not be extended any more and they should be set at liberty forthwith, pleaded Shukla.

Hearing the application to refuse the remand of the accused, the court did not find prima-facie evidence against them and hence also did not find it proper to keep them in jail any longer. The court accordingly ordered release of all the accused on a personal bond and single surety. The court directed the accused to cooperate in the investigation."

Joshi's demand was backed by the Congress whose general secretary in-charge of UP Digvijay Singh said the UP police could not be trusted in the matter. Her house was vandalised and set on fire on July 15.

Joshi, who is due to meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi, apologized for her remarks and claimed that she had been ""a bit misunderstood"". She is currently on interim bail.

KOLKATA: The mysterious fire at the office of the West Bengal minorities development commission at Bhawani Bhavan in Kolkata on October 28 was an act of arson, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said in the state assembly on Thursday. In reply to a question from opposition leader Pankaj Banerjee, he said the forensic report into the fire had revealed that it was an arson, not an accidental fire like short circuit. A case was started at the Alipore police station on December 17 on the basis of the forensic report. Describing the development as ""a serious one"", Bhattacharjee said the responsibility of the inquiry would not be left only to the Alipore police station. Senior police officials, too, would be involved in it. He could not fix a date by which the investigations would be completed. Trinamul leader Saugata Roy said there were serious doubts if the office premises was not set on fire deliberately to destroy papers relating to loans given to the minority community in the period between February and April, prior to the last Lok Sabha poll. In this period, loans were disbursed at random for purchase of autos and taxis, without proper documents, he alleged. It may be mentioned that immediately after the fire, Trinamul leaders in a Press conference had made similar allegations. Denying the allegations, Bhattacharjee said it was not correct to say that loans had been disbursed with a political motive. Preliminary investigations did not point to the possibility that the office was set on fire in such a fashion that politically significant documents were destroyed. Though a number of documents were destroyed in the fire and the water that the fire brigade used to douse it, all of them had a ""complete back-up in hard copies,"" the chief minister said.

LUCKNOW: Over a dozen were injured as people went berserk on Tuesday over police refusal to lodge FIR regarding a minor's rape on Monday in Mainpuri.

The irate mob torched three buses, a police jeep and offices of Circle Officer (CO) and sub-divisional magistrate (SDM). The traffic on the GT Road too was thrown out of gear.

Trouble began when hundreds of locals, protesting against police refusal to lodge an FIR about the rape of a minor girl on Monday, lost their cool.

The police, who had allegedly refused to register the rape case, however rounded up over a dozen persons on charges of rioting and arson after the violence.

It all began on Monday when a nine-year-old girl who had accompanied a baraat to a school campus in Bhogaon was allegedly kidnapped and raped by a peon of the school.

The incident came to light when the girl told her parents about the incident after escaping from the accused who had held her hostage.

The family members and guests who had come to attend the marriage ceremony, searched the peon, identified as Govind. Allegations are that instead of lodging an FIR, the police asked the family members to search for Govind themselves...

...

When locals reached the police station on Tuesday morning to request lodging of an FIR, police allegedly waved it away.

This sparked off widespread resentment and locals joined by people from far-flung areas who were passing from the site, staged a protest outside the local police station.

When there was no response from police, the mob shifted to GT Road and blocked the highway demanding immediate arrest of the peon.

The protesters lost cool and began pelting stones at the passing vehicles. Soon violence broke out and chaos prevailed.

By the time police could ""reach"" the site, the mob had already torched three UP State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) buses.

As the circle officer (CO) was the first among the officers to reach the site, he had to bear the brunt. The protesters even torched the officer's jeep.

While this was underway, a section of the mob marched towards office of CO and SDM and torched the premises. Before fire could be extinguished, a section of the two offices was reduced to ashes.

The situation was brought under control around 4.30 pm after CO and SDM assured early arrest of the accused. Though the road blockade was lifted on assurance, tension was palpable in the area.

Additional forces were rushed from Etah and other adjoining districts to take control of the situation. Further details are awaited."

All these students are from MBBS 2002 batch and are alleged to be part of the 2 mob which attacked the vice-chancellor's residence and set the administrative block on fire.

The accused students Mukesh Kumar, Surendra Singh, Ram Kishore Rajput, Pankaj Tyagi and Sumit Kaushik have been expelled from the hostels with immediate effect.

Though, they have been allowed to appear in the examinations, their results will be declared only after they are cleared by the inquiry committee.

Earlier, 36 students were suspended by the KGMU in January, soon after the incident. Significantly, out of total 41 students accused of arson on the campus, most are of 2002 batch, which raises doubts over Combined Pre-Medical Test (CPMT) 2002.

Interestingly, all the five students suspended on Thursday were among the top in the merit list of the CPMT 2002, but their academic record in KGMU internal examinations reflects otherwise.

Sample this: Sumit Kaushik cleared CPMT at first attempt with sixth rank. However, the 'meritorious' candidate failed in all subjects in the first professional examinations held in October 2003.

Though, he cleared first year in March 2004 but again failed in one subject in second professional examinations in September 2005.

Pankaj Tyagi qualified CPMT in fourth attempt and was placed 20th in the merit list. He, too, failed in all the subjects in first professional examinations, passed in the second attempt in March 2004 but again failed in two subjects in the second professional examinations.

It took Surendra Singh (scheduled caste candidate) five attempts to qualify CPMT. He got 45th rank in the merit list. However, he also failed in all the subjects in first professional.

Somehow, he cleared subjects in the second attempt, but failed again in all the subjects in second professional examinations.

RK Rajput qualified CPMT in sixth attempt. He was placed 49th in the merit list. He failed in first professional and later cleared it in second attempt. Mukesh Kumar qualified CPMT in third attempt.

He got 24th position in the merit list. He took two attempts to clear first professional and again failed in all the subjects in second professional. He is also said to be close to Dr KK Singh, prime accused in arson case.

All these students, KGMU authorities said, have dubious records. The name of one of them had also figured in a kidnapping case."

Further inquiry confirmed his role in the murder .Police said the boy was studying in Class IX in the school where the girl studied. He had forced the victim to come with him to the jasmine farm and once they reached the spot, he attempted to sexually assault her, though the girl resisted his advances and beat him.

BENGALURU: A 45-year-old defence establishment employee allegedly assaulted his wife after she recently caught him hiding in a cupboard of their Mahadevapura residence to snoop on her as he suspected her.As it emerged that he had been bunking work often to spy on his wife for 17 years, she sought police intervention. He is under psychiatric treatment.The man and wife began courting each other in 2002 before tying the knot. But things soured in a year when he began suspecting his wife and often hid in the house to catch her in the act after pretending to have left to office. “This went on for years after their marriage and they having two children. Two years ago, he underwent treatment for paranoia and turned really loving towards his family. Abruptly, he stopped treatment and started confronting his innocent wife with claims that she was having affair with multiple men,” said Bindya Yohannan, counsellor at Parihar, the Vanitha Sahayavani (Women’s Helpline).Bindiya handled the case after the 38-yearold woman walked into their office in June with her grievance and met Parihar head Rani Shetty. The man had allegedly brutally assaulted his wife numerous times. He picked fights with the local milkman and newspaper delivery person over his suspicions.“It became unbearable for the 38-year-old wife during the lockdown as he informed members of his church group that his wife was mentally ill and any phone call from her to them about her being in danger needn’t be taken seriously. She suspected that he was planning to kill her as his paranoia had gone out of control as he had stopped all medication,” Yohannan added.“It was a very sensitive case as the man remained extremely violent towards his wife. We contacted the local police station and cops visited him and explained the situation. It was ensured he sought psychiatric help,” Shetty added.The Parihar personnel have been monitoring the progress of the case over phone."

A special act should be passed to prevent assaults on government employees,” he added.

Assistant commissioner Mahmad Zuber, who received the memorandum, said the attack on tahsildar by a retired teacher is a worrisome incident. “It shows the need for security of tahsildars and staff involved in field work. Revenue department staff work hard, especially during emergencies like election, flood, drought and pandemic, apart from their routine works,” he said.

He suggested the employees to seek police protection if they face any threat while discharging their duties.

Sex chat: Kids from 4 schools in group

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

NEW DELHI: Delhi police cyber cell has registered a case taking cognisance of a series of conversations on Instagram between an alleged group of school students who threaten to sexually assault a classmate and speak of uploading her photographs online. According to a senior police officer, a school student has been apprehended and he has identified other members of the group. The other members of the group will also be examined, he said. Police sources said some college students could also be part of the group.Initially confined to Instagram, the screenshots were shared widely on Twitter on Monday and #boyslockerroom was a top trend in India throughout the day.Delhi Commission for Women has issued a notice to the social media company regarding the private group, “Bois (sic) Locker Room”.Anvyesh Roy, DCP, Cyber Cell, said, “We took suo motu notice of the viral screenshots and have registered a case under sections 67, 67A of the Information Technology (IT) Act, IPC 465 (punishment for forgery), 469 (forgery for harming reputation) and 471 (using as genuine a forged) has been registered.”Another police officer said, “We interviewed the minor and he told us they were not morphing pictures of their classmates but of random public accounts on Instagram. He said he did not know many people in the group as they were from other schools. After screenshots of the alleged group went viral, the group was deleted and another was created as ‘lockerroom 2.0’ in which girls were also added. We have also come across some conversations on Snapchat.”Investigations have revealed the group was created around a week ago, and had 21 members, including the admin. Children from threefour schools, including one in south Delhi, were its members. Some students claimed they were part of it but had not posted a message or got involved. A student TOI spoke to revealed some members later started communicating on Snapchat and started talking about sexually assaulting a woman.“I saw some screenshots of an Instagram page group called ‘ Boys Locker Room ’. They are representative of criminal, disgusting and rapist mentality,” DCW chief Swati Maliwal wrote while demanding that the boys be apprehended “so that a strong message can be sent out”.The revelations also highlight the importance of security and safety of minors on online platforms. “We absolutely do not allow behaviour that promotes sexual violence or exploits anyone, especially women and young people, and have actioned content violating our Community Standards as we were made aware of it. We have policies that disallow the sharing of non-consensual intimate imagery, as well as threats to share such imagery and we take this issue very seriously,” a Facebook spokesperson told TOI. Facebook owns Instagram.Psychologists say the normalisation of misogyny and sexism has exacerbated the violence against women. Boys often express their “masculinity” through dominance and violence as they learn and internalise this through unreliable sources of information, tweeted Ruchita, a Mumbai-based psychologist. “Teenage brains are still developing and highly impressionable. I know they don’t command empathy, but they’re also vulnerable to a larger system of violence,” she wrote.DCW has asked Instagram to share the details of the admin and each group member by May 8.

AURANGABAD: Police allegedly deflated the tyres of private ambulances on the GMCH premises here and also assaulted the drivers on Wednesday, leaving many, especially the medical fraternity, shocked.

It is alleged that personnel from the Begumpura police were involved in the incident at the GMCH around noon, which is the largest state-run hospital in the region.

The drivers alleged that the policemen deflated the tyres of at least half a dozen ambulances, before caning some of them, who sought to know the reason for their action.

The action against the drivers and targeting of ambulances, which have been marked as essential services during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, has attracted serious criticism from different quarters.

Moreover, the action is directly in contrast to the state government and police’s stand over using force against those who are part of essential services and commoners stepping out of home to buy essential goods. Some of the drivers suspect that Wednesday’s police action is a result of one of the ambulance drivers getting into a heated argument with an employee of GMCH.

“The class-IV employee of GMCH abused one of our drivers over parking of an ambulance on Tuesday. The driver took a strong objection to the abuse, which resulted into a heated argument,” said a driver.

Driver Pradip Shinde said, “Ambulances are essential services and policemen deflating tyres is against the norm.”

The drivers unanimously expressed concern over the incident and said that police’s act would have cost some emergency patient his/her life. “Had there been some emergency and movement of a patient, or an accident, we would have been helpless due to the deflated tyres,” said another driver.

Driver Azhar Khan said that they had to remove the deflated tyres and go to a nearby shop to fill air and put them back. “This consumed at least two hours. Police should realise that every minute is precious at GMCH, which is the largest government-run hospital in the region.”

When contacted, assistant commissioner of police (city) HS Bhapkar said, “Deflating tyres of ambulances, prima facie appears to be very serious. We are looking into it. It'll be brought to the notice of seniors, following which they will decide on the course of action.”

Begumpura police station inspector Sachin Sanap could not be reached for comment despite repeated attempts.

MUMBAI: A 22-year-old man was allegedly abducted and sexually assaulted by four men who were connected with him on a social media app, the police said on Wednesday.

All four accused have been nabbed.

The incident took place on Sunday night when the complainant was standing near a restaurant in suburban Kurla, a police official said.

Two men who arrived on a two-wheeler approached him and said they were connected on photo-sharing app Instagram, and invited him to join them.

The complainant agreed and sat between the two on the two-wheeler, but when he saw that they were heading for Vidyavihar, he asked them to stop.

The duo, however, allegedly took him to a spot near Vidyavihar railway station and forced him to sit in a car with another man inside.

The three then sexually assaulted him inside the car, the complainant said.

Another man joined them and they drove to a petrol pump where the payment was made through the complainant's credit card, he told the police.

They also snatched Rs 2,000 in cash from him before dumping him on the roadside, he said.

He then called the police control room for help. A police team admitted him to a hospital.

A case was registered under IPC section 377 (forcible same-sex intercourse), 392 (robbery), 323 (assault) at Vinboa Bhave police station in Kurla.

The police tracked down the accused from registration numbers of the two-wheeler and the car from CCTV footage and arrested Mehul Parmar (21), Asif Ali Ansari (23) and Piyush Chauhan (22) on Tuesday. A fourth accused is a minor and he too was apprehended.

The three arrested men were sent in police custody till Monday while the minor accused was sent to a children's home.

They allegedly told the police during interrogation that they knew where to find the victim as he had taken a selfie outside the restaurant where he was standing, uploaded it on Instagram and mentioned the location.

Amanatullah Khan won with a margin of over 71,000 votes from Okhla, where Shaheen Bagh is located.

MEERUT: Kin of AAP leader Amanatullah Khan , who won from the Okhla constituency, have alleged that a team of the Uttar Pradesh police barged into their Meerut house on Tuesday night, hurled abuses and assaulted the family members and also misbehaved with the women for celebrating the victory . The women alleged that the policemen pulled them by their hair and dragged them out of the house and ""paraded"" them in the village on the pretext of locating the male members of their family who had fled to escape the police.

Station officer of Parikshitgarh Police Station, Kailash Chandra, refuted the allegations, saying some villagers were trying to take out a victory procession despite being told that CrPC section 144 was in place in the area. An FIR has been filed against the family for ""violating prohibitory orders,"" he said.

“We received information that a group of people were planning to take out a procession to celebrate the victory of AAP's Amanatullah Khan. We asked them not to as prohibitory orders were in place but they would not listen. So we booked 13 of them, including Noorullah Khan, under IPC section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant). There is no truth in the allegation that the police team assaulted the family members at night,” said Chandra.

The incident allegedly took place in Agwanpur village of Meerut. Twenty-year-old Zainab Khan, who claimed the police misbehaved with her, said, “On Tuesday afternoon we were distributing sweets to celebrate the victory of my uncle Amanatullah Khan. My father, Noorullah Khan, who is also a social activist, was resting when a police jeep came and asked for him. He came out and tried to explain that youngsters were celebrating the victory and there was nothing illegal about it. But the cops would not relent. They hurled abuses at him and tried to push him into the police vehicle. At night, police came again, barged into our house and asked for my uncle. When we said he was not in, they pulled our hair and dragged me and my cousin (Najmi) out of the house.”

Najmi Khan added, “They hurdled filthy abuses at us; one of them pointed a gun at me, brandished a lathi and threatened me with dire consequences if I did not reveal details of my uncle Noorullah Khan's whereabouts. Then they paraded me in the village, abusing me and asking where my uncle was.""

When TOI contacted Noorullah Khan, he said, “I do not know why I am being framed in a fake case. I have no criminal record. My nephew, Amanatullah Khan, has won the Delhi assembly elections and there were some celebrations outside our house. There was no procession.”

IG Praveen Tripathi said, “I am not aware of the alleged police brutality against the women. If there is a complaint regarding the matter, I will certainly order an inquiry. The police team did stop the family members of Noorullah from taking out a procession without permission, for which they were booked.”

Amanatullah Khan won with a margin of over 71,000 votes from Okhla, where Shaheen Bagh is located.

AURANGABAD: Two people have been arrested in a case related to the assault of a traffic police constable on Thursday morning. Two others have been booked and a 17-year-old has been detained.

The dispute allegedly took place around 12.30pm when Shahzeb, 23, was heading towards a pharmacy on Anna Bhau Sathe Crossroad near the district collectorate. According to him, he was riding his two-wheeler past some policemen when one of them hit him with his baton. Shahzeb was injured near the eye and the wound started bleeding. He stopped his vehicle and returned to question the policemen but they insisted they had not hit him. Shahzeb then called up his brother Shahrukh, who, along with their father, arrived at the spot.

A video taken at the scene shows a heated argument taking place. Shahrukh and a traffic constable almost come to blows but are separated by the father and women constables present at the spot.

The video, which went viral, shows the traffic policeman hitting Shahzeb on the leg with his baton. The youth, in turn, snatches the baton and hits the cop. The video also shows that though there were nine policemen present at the spot, including an assistant inspector, only the female constables intervened and rescued the traffic cop.

Shaikh Farooq (50) and his son Shahrukh, residents of Rauza Baugh area, have been arrested.

Aurangabad commissioner of police Chiranjeev Prasad said, “We will not tolerate attacks on government servants. Two people have been arrested and the strictest possible action is being initiated.”

Based on the complaint lodged by the assistant inspector, the suspects have been slapped with sections of the IPC including 353 (using criminal force to deter a government employee from performing his duty), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty), 333 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt to a government employee discharging his duty), 337 (committing an act so rashly or negligently as to endanger human life, or the personal safety of others), 143 (unlawful assembly) and 147 (rioting). The offence has been registered with the City Chowk police station.

Deputy commissioner of police (zone-II) Nikesh Khatmode-Patil said, “As per preliminary reports, an injured youth blamed the traffic cop for hitting him. The allegation has been refuted. We are carrying out a detailed probe into the incident.”

BUFFALO: Two Buffalo police officers were charged with assault Saturday , prosecutors said, after a video showed them shoving a 75-year-old protester in recent demonstrations over the death of George Floyd in Minnesota.

Both pleaded not guilty to second-degree assault. They were released without bail.

The officers had been suspended without pay Friday after a TV crew captured the confrontation the night before near the end of protests.

The footage shows a man identified as Martin Gugino approaching a line of helmeted officers holding batons as they clear demonstrators from Niagara Square around the time of an 8 p.m. curfew.

Two officers push Gugino backward, and he hits his head on the pavement. Blood spills as officers walk past. One officer leans down to check on the injured man before another officer urges the colleague to keep walking.

Dozens of police officers stepped down from the department's crowd control unit Friday, in response to their fellow officers' suspensions.

MUMBAI: A UK national has been booked for allegedly assaulting policemen early on Sunday. He was allegedly drunk at the time of the incident.

But Dashani Shree Kotak (32), an MBA professional employed with an international marketing firm, claimed he was trying to stop a fight between two men outside a Vile Parle pub near the domestic airport, when the police detained him instead of taking action against them. Kotak, who suffered injuries on the eye, chin and lips, said the cops punched him, but the police claimed he first assaulted constables Nitesh Dandge (33) and Umesh Shelar at Airport police station.

“A case has been registered and a complaint will be filed at the UK consulate,” said additional commissioner of police (West) Manoj Sharma, adding that the CCTV footage retrieved from the police station clearly shows Kotak first assaulting the constables.

Kotak had come to Mumbai last month. Late on Saturday, he and his fiancee went to Barrel Mansion pub. Kotak’s fiancee said when they were leaving the place, they saw two men fighting near the exit. “Kotak only intervened in the fight,” she claimed. “But the policemen who reached the spot couldn’t communicate properly in English, while Kotak does not understand Hindi. This led to confusion and the police detained him and took him in an autorickshaw to the police station. Now they have cooked up a story to save themselves from the consequences of assaulting a UK national. This is police gundagiri.”

A 32-second CCTV clip from the area shows the cops pulling Kotak out of an autorickshaw, grabbing his collar and taking him to Airport police station. Kotak’s brother Rick told TOI that the cops punched and thrashed him in the rickshaw. “The pub’s security guards called the police and they abused my brother and took him to the police station instead of taking action against the two men who were fighting.” He claimed that Kotak was ‘illegally detained’ for over two hours.

But Sharma said: “Kotak was taken to the police station because he intervened in police duty and got abusive when asked to step aside. When brought to the police station, he assaulted the policemen.” A three-minute CCTV footage from the police station showed three constables asking Kotak to sit in a corner. “The footage clearly showed that Kotak twice slapped, spat and even kicked Dandge in the groin. Hence, the cops retaliated and tried to control Kotak who was drunk,” said zonal DCP Ganesh Shinde.

Both Kotak and constable Dandge were discharged from hospital after treatment.

A staffer from Barrel Mansion told TOI they were unaware about the incident.

Aurangabad: Pharmacies have exempted from the ongoing lockdown and are continued to operate as essential service providers. However, notwithstanding this exemption, Beed municipal council chief officer (CO) Utkarsh Gutte was caught on CCTV camera assaulting a local pharmacist with a baton on Thursday morning.

Police officers clarified that only police personnel are allowed to carry a baton and use force — if and when needed — to control a situation.

“Nobody, except the police, is allowed to carry a baton or use force. In this case, it is a matter of investigation. We will find out what exactly transpired between the pharmacist and the civic chief,” Beed superintendent of police Harssh Poddar said.

Pharmacist Shaikh Mumtaz, who was assaulted, said: “The civic body chief reached the counter of my pharmacy and tried to down the shutters. When I questioned him, he hit me with the baton.”

He said the incident was caught on the CCTV cameras installed at the store. Mumtaz added that there was neither any violation nor any rush at the store when the incident took place.

CO Gutte, meanwhile, said, “The pharmacist had been warned several times in the past to ensure social distancing. However, he did not comply. When we tried to close down the shutter of the pharmacy, he got into an argument with me.” When Gutte was asked why he was carrying a baton, which he used to hit the pharmacist with — he claimed that his intention was not to hit anyone.

Locals alleged that the Beed civic body had also been using force against poor vegetable vendors citing violation of lockdown.

Despite repeated attempts, district collector Rahul Rekhawar could not be reached for his comment.

Pharmacies threaten to go on strike

Arun Barkase, the state vice-president of the pharmacist and druggist association, while demanding registration of an FIR against the CO, has now threatened to go on a strike. “If action is not initiated against the CO, the pharmacy stores will go on a strike. He said that a written complaint has already been lodged with the Beed city police station.

The incident has been caught in CCTV cameras installed at the pharmacy in the Bashirganj locality. The video went viral on social media drawing serious criticism.

File photo of doctors' protest at NRS Hospital

KOLKATA: The police, who are probing the assault on doctors at the NRS Hospital in 2019 , are likely to seek legal guidance from Lalbazar after three attempts to record the statements of doctors failed.

Though eight people were arrested in connection with the case, none of the key witnesses recorded their statements, making it difficult for the police to file a chargesheet and for the accused to get bail. ""At present, the case has gone off the priority list. But it has not been shelved. We are keeping the court updated about the case,"" said a police officer. What has come as the biggest setback so far is the cops' failure to convince junior doctors Paribaha Mukhopadhyay and Yash Tekwani to record their statements, despite three notices being served to them under CrPC 91. ""We need the statements to be recorded before a magistrate. We are yet to speak to Mukhopadhyay in detail about the case,"" said the officer.

As per the CrPC 91, whenever any court or any officer-in-charge of a police station considers that the production of any document or statement is necessary for any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code, summons or written order may be issued to a person or persons in this regard.

""The police went to him multiple times, but were informed that he was still recovering and was not in a position to record his statement. Some other doctors of the hospital have also requested the two to be witnesses in the case,"" sources said.

PUNE: A 50-year-old drifter, known to many residents and business persons on Prabhat Road and Deccan area as ‘John Baba’, was found brutally assaulted and injured on the Riverbed Road early on Thursday morning.

Senior inspector Deepak Lagad of the Deccan Gymkhana police station told TOI, “John Baba is from an educated family. Nevertheless, for unknown reasons, he started staying on the pavements and worked as a waiter at prominent restaurants in the area. Later, he gave up the job and started begging. He is a graduate and would often converse in English with local traders, restaurant customers, and others. John also has a penchant for crisp, clean branded clothes.”

The police are trying to locate John’s relatives. As of now, he has been admitted to Sassoon General Hospital and doctors said he is out of danger.

Lagad said, “The assault took place under Sambhaji Bridge on the riverbed road around 12.30am. Usually, the area remains crowded at the time owing to the eateries and tonga operators active in the stretch. Unidentified assailant(s) attempted to smash John’s head with a brick. Local traders and a police patrol team rushed to the spot on hearing his screams.”

“We have registered a case of attempt to murder although the motive behind the crime is yet to be established,” Lagad said.

Local businessman Manpreet Singh said, “John is a good human being. He greets everyone with a smile. The residents of Prabhat Road know him very well.”

“Some people from Prabhat Road and Fergusson College Road informed us that he belongs to a good family and he used to stay in a house on Prabhat Road. But his past is obscure,” Lagad said. “We have appealed local residents to come forward and help the police track his relatives,” he added.

According to the police, John Baba and two others, including a scrap collector, had been staying under the bridge. “John did not have any addiction. He would buy tea and snacks from the local shopkeepers instead of begging for food. He used to seek alms from passers-by,” Lagad said. One of the two men who used to stay beneath the bridge has been missing for the last two days, the police said.

MADURAI: A counter case registered against a postgraduate (PG) doctor by the two women who assaulted the doctor at a labour ward in Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) was closed by the police on Friday.

On December 14, a patient’s kin attacked a PG doctor, Dr Malathi in the maternity ward after they were denied entry into a sterile ward with her footwear on. The doctors and hospital staff staged a protest in the campus after this incident.

In response, an FIR was registered against the accused Raja Rajeshwari and Murugeshwari under the Tamil Nadu Hospital Protection Act 2008 based on the PG doctor’s complaint. The accused were also later arrested.

Reportedly at the same time, an FIR was also registered against Dr Malathi based on the complaint given by the two women.

“However, nobody had any knowledge of it including the GRH authorities till now. The police had not consulted with anyone before registering the FIR. This in fact suggests a loophole in the Tamil Nadu Hospital Protection Act 2008 putting doctors at risk of having counter cases filed against them. Immediately, we convened a meeting and demanded the police to close the case,” said one of the PG doctors at GRH.

On the other hand, police sources said that the counter-FIR was registered as per due process but the counter case has been closed now after talks with GRH dean Dr Sangumani J as well. “There was no evidence found to substantiate the two women’s complaints, according to the investigating officer. The accused were also not admitted to hospital. So, the counter case has been closed now,” said a police source.

BATHINDA: Punjab jails minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa has ordered an investigation into the December 30 assault on a farmer union’s vice-president in Faridkot jail.

Randhawa said he had asked ADGP (jails) to find how a gangster and his henchmen beat up the inmate, Kirti Kisan Union vice president Rajinder Singh. An officer of the rank of deputy inspector general of police (DIG) has been asked to inquire into the matter and fix responsibility of the jail staff.

Speaking to TOI, Randhawa said, “I had taken up the matter with ADGP (jails) and asked him to get the matter probed. The ADGP has deputed a DIG-level officer to investigate by concentrating on talking to the inmate who was beaten up and those who were around. We will reach to the bottom of the matter and anyone found guilty of dereliction of duty will be taken to task.”

Rajinder was attacked in the jail on December 30 evening. With blunt injuries on the body, he was admitted to Guru Gobind Singh Medical College, Faridkot. Nishan Singh, who is serving a life sentence for abducting and raping a minor girl, is behind the attack. A case has been registered against Nishan and 17 others.

Farmer organisation activists KKU president Nirbhay Singh Dhudike and BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri said it was a matter of serious concern how Nishan and his accomplices were allowed to go near Rajinder, who had been fighting for justice all through his life.

While he was the president of a faction of Punjab Students Union, Rajinder was at the forefront of protests against abduction and rape of a minor girl in Faridkot by Nishan in 2012. Due to the sustained struggle by him and other activists, police had arrested Nishan from Goa along with the girl.

He was sentenced to life imprisonment in May 2013. Late,r Nishan and his mother were made to pay a compensation of Rs 90 lakh to the survivor’s family as damages. PSU activists claimed that Nishan wanted to take revenge from Rajinder for the role he played in the struggle.

Meanwhile, a four-member team of the Democratic Lawyers Association (DLA) on Wednesday met Faridkot jail superintendent and made investigations. Association member Rajiv Lohatbaddi alleged it seemed some jail officials were hand in glove with Nishan.

“We have tried to make assessment after meeting the jail superintendent and will hand over our report to the chief justice of Punjab and Haryana high court,” he said.

BHUBANESWAR: An purported video showing a group of men assaulting a woman in full public view in Old Town area here on Tuesday has gone viral, triggering backlash from citizens. As many targeted the police and state government over worsening law and order situation, Shree Lingaraj police said the motive behind the attack was land dispute and that they had detained two of the attackers, both residents of Old Town area.

In her complaint, the woman alleged that some members of a local community club has usurped a patch of her land near Bindu Sagar. “Their plan is to kill me so that they can take over our entire land. On Tuesday, the club’s members started pelting stones at my house. When I opposed, they assaulted me in public,” said 38-year-old Sabita Sethy.

She also complained that a number of people were seen filming the act on their smartphones, but none volunteered to stop the men from assaulting her.

As the video went viral on social media on Wednesday, people came down heavily on the police for the unsafe atmosphere in the city. “We do not see the fear of police in the eyes of anti-socials. Miscreants are striking at ease,” said Prabodh Mohanty, a social media user.

The alleged assault comes in the backdrop of the daylight attack on a Sikh businessman in Laxmisagar area of the city in January.

Opposition BJP and Congress reacted sharply on the issue. “It is disgraceful and shocking to see miscreants assaulting a woman in public. What could be worse than this? This has put a question mark on the law and order situation,” tweeted senior BJP leader Bhrugu Baxipatra.

State Congress president Niranjan Patnaik also took to twitter to target the police over the worsening law and order situation. “Govt has failed to protect its citizens, especially women & girls. Such violent acts have left people in a state of fear & panic,” Niranjan tweeted.

Police said all those involved in the attack on the woman would be arrested. “On coming to know about the attack on a lady last evening, police contacted the lady & on our initiative a case has been registered at Shree Lingaraj police station. The identity of the accused is known. The attack is over a land dispute. Action under law is being taken,” read a tweet from the DCP’s office.

The Times of India published the news item headlined “ Viral video shows cops beating up 16-year-old boy ” on June 23.

The SHRC directed the commissioner to submit a detailed report within two weeks.

A small argument between police and a couple turned violent after police officials started beating up the couple’s minor son in Rathinapuri on June 17. The video of the same went viral on WhatsApp.

The incident took place when Velmayil, 47, and his wife kept their tiffin centre open even 9pm on June 17. Their tiffin stall is in Shastri Street at Rathinapuri. Sub-inspector (SI) Chellamani, who was on patrol, instructed them to shut the shop as 8pm closing time due to the lockdown.

The couple tried to explain that they paid Rs 10,000 as rent and had to make some business to meet their expenses.

Their 16-year-old son had taken videos of the incident which was noticed by the police. The official seized the phone.

In retaliation to this act by the police, the boy snatched the official’s bike key. Irked over the boy’s act, Chellamani started assaulting the boy. Chellamani also threatened the boy’s parents that the minor would be sent to jail for his behaviour.

Later, the boy was taken to the police station. The minor boy is studying in Class X. So the police did not register a case against him.

Child activists claimed that if a minor boy was involved in a conflict with the law, he should be treated carefully by officials. Police cannot assault a minor nor can he be taken to a police station. They should inform Childline officials, who deal with children in conflict with law.

NEW DELHI: With Army chief General M M Naravane briefing the top political leadership about the operational situation in eastern Ladakh , the defence establishment is reasonably confident that its “total combat potential” now deployed in the region will deter any offensive thrust or major misadventure from China.Naravane is learned to have briefed PM Narendra Modi on Thursday after returning from his visit to forward areas in eastern Ladakh, which was followed by another meeting with defence minister Rajnath Singh on Friday.The assessment as of now is that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is “unlikely to risk an all-out offensive” despite all its muscle-flexing by amassing troops and heavy weaponry along the unresolved Line of Actual Control (LAC), especially in the strategically located Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO)-Depsang area, sources said.With India too deploying thousands of additional troops backed by tanks, infantry combat vehicles and howitzers in the region, and IAF fighters like Sukhoi-30 MKIs and MiG-29s regularly patrolling the skies, “criticalities in full operational preparedness” that existed before have been plugged. “We are well-poised in the forward areas with a strong military posture, with more troops and weaponry positioned in the depth areas,” a source said.But face-offs and clashes cannot be ruled out due to tensions running high on the ground, especially in the Pangong Tso and Galwan Valley regions, though the rival troops are maintaining “stand-off distances” from each other.China is continuing to aggressively push its claim at “Patrolling Point-14” in Galwan Valley region, the site of the bloody clashes on June 15, where the PLA is demanding Indian troops must not cross the confluence of the Shyok and Galwan rivers.Similarly, PLA soldiers continue to occupy the “Finger-4 to 8” area (mountainous spurs stretching over a distance of 8km) on the north bank of Pangong Tso since early-May, having built dozens of fortifications and taking the heights to dominate the area there.But the Indian Army remains firm it will not yield to China’s attempt to grab more area in both Galwan and Pangong Tso areas, and is pressing for restoration of status quo as it existed in April.“There has been no disengagement and de-escalation on the ground, just a few vehicles moving up and down. It might take a few months… can stretch till October. We are in a wait-and-watch mode,” another source said.China may be pushing the LAC to the west under its continuing strategy to incrementally grab territory, but an offensive thrust would require the PLA to bring in a “much higher level of combat, combat-support elements and logistics” to the LAC given India’s enhanced operational preparedness. “That level of offensive intent from the PLA is not visible on the ground yet,” the source said.Militarily, the PLA’s deep incursion into the Depsang Bulge, a sprawling plateau to the north of Galwan, where too it has restricted the movement of Indian patrols as in the Pangong Tso and Galwan areas, is the most worrisome, as reported by TOI earlier.The DBO-Depsang sector is the place where India has concentrated its forces, with an infantry division (10,000-12,000 troops) geared for high-altitude warfare and other weapon systems like M-777 ultra-light howitzers, to check further ingress by Chinese troops.In Video: ‘Total combat potential’ will deter Chinese assault, according to Forces"

KOLKATA: Four persons hailing from Burtolla were arrested by the RG Kar Hospital police for allegedly assaulting and threatening the doctors and staff on duty at the transitional care unit (TCU) on Saturday.Police said the trouble started in the wee hours when the four came to the hospital with their relative, who suffered injuries on both hands, and demanded immediate treatment for him. Cops said that all four — identified as Suraj Poddar (23), Tukun Das (38), Somnath Das (19) and Suraj Khatik (20) — were in an inebriated condition.“It was only in the morning — around 9.30am — that we put them under arrest.

The Tallah police later slapped the stringent Section 4 of West Bengal Health Care Services Act, 2009.Police said that the four came with Dhiraj Kumar Jaiswal (40), who suffered bleeding injuries, probably a result of an argument between the five, around 12.45am. “They demanded immediate treatment. When the security asked only one person to accompany the patient, all hell broke loose. The accused shouted and then assaulted the staff. Soon, reinforcements were called in with OC Tallah himself rushing to the spot. Initially, we did not receive complaint, but the principal’s office finally lodged the complaint in the morning. We checked CCTV footage and arrested the accused,” said an officer.The incident comes even as a second security audit at government hospitals has already begun — it actually began last Tuesday at the RG Kar Hospital itself. It will cover other medical colleges like NRS Hospital and SSKM Hospital till November 11 after which a comprehensive report will be prepared and sent to the government with suggestions of further changes.“We found some minor issues with the private security arrangements there.

Accused Kush Bera (36) was arrested in the evening.

The incident in Bagnan’s Gopalpur took a political turn after BJP MPs Locket Chatterjee and Saumitra Khan staged a road blockade.

Bombay high court

MUMBAI: In a relief to a flyer convicted for an offence of sexual assault on a child actor mid-air , Bombay high court on Tuesday granted him bail after admitting his appeal against the guilty verdict of a trial court.

The appeal by a former entertainment firm executive, Vikas Sachdeva came up before a bench of Justice Prithviraj Chavan of the high court who suspended the sentence and granted bail of Rs 25,000 with two solvent sureties of like amount.

The high court also directed that he cannot leave the city without court permission.

A special trial court judge A D Deo had on January 15 held Sachdeva, 41, guilty under section 8 under of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. The accusation was that he put his foot and touched a 17-year-old co-passenger, sitting in front in the business class, on her shoulder and neck on a flight from Delhi to Mumbai in December 2017. The trial court relied on the complainant’s deposition to nail him.

The trial court had sentenced him to three years’ imprisonment fined him Rs 25,000 but granted him bail under the provisions of law.

Justice Chavan first asked why should a Pocso victim be disbelieved and why would she lie.

Sachdeva’s counsel Aniket Nikam argued that there was ""no independent evidence to support the case of the victim and her deposition is shrouded with omissions and improvements"". He submitted that there is ""contradiction between the version of the complainant and other eyewitnesses,"" and that crew members had ""categorically deposed"" that the accused was found sleeping throughout the flight and no such incident was noticed by them.

Nikam also submitted that the victim herself or her mother never made any complaint to the crew members while on the flight and added that it was only after social media post that the police lodged the crime.

He argued that the bail granted was to him and he deserved bail pending the hearing of his appeal.

The prosecutor opposed the grant of bail saying it was a serious case under Pocso. The first appeal against conviction is admitted as a right but the flyer wanted his bail to continue.

His appeal, however, challenged the conviction on various grounds, including that it is wrong on the appreciation of facts, circumstances and the evidence, produced during trial.

The argument was also that it was ""unlikely that leg would have touched the victims shoulder taking into consideration the distance between the two business class seats"" It was submitted that the fact that there was a lot of space on the right and left side of the seat after the ""victim occupied the said seat"" must be considered.

""Leg cannot be like a snake and take turns in the fashion in which it is alleged,"" said Nikam.

The conviction is ""contrary to the established principles of law,"" and that the trial court has ""erred"" as it ""overlooked glaring contradiction omission, as well as admissions and improvements that were brought to the notice of the Judge”, said the appeal.

""Judgment is based totally on hypothecation, imagination, conjuncture and surmises and not at all on the evidence on record,"" added the appeal. The flyer was in custody for 11 days after his arrest on December 10, 2017, and has been on bail since.

The trial court had while convicting him said, ""The incident as deposed by the victim of inappropriate explicit touch by male accused in the journey is a very common sexual assault experience by every common woman travelling in public transport. The present case would reflect that such experience is not an exception in the most elite mode of transportation, that too in business class"".

People gathered around and witnessed the incident. One person from the crowd shot the assault on his video and it was shared widely on WhatsApp on Monday. Chellamani threatened the boy’s parents saying that the minor would ill be sent to jail for his behaviour.

Later, the boy was taken to the police station.

He did not allow the police officer to discharge his duty. However, a case was registered against Velmayil under Section 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) of the Indian Penal Code.”

Child activists claimed that if a minor boy was involved in a conflict with the law, he should be treated carefully by the officials. Police cannot assault a minor nor can he be taken to a police station. They should inform Childline officials, who deal with children in conflict with law.

NEW DELHI: The Army is planning to order another 72,000 assault rifles from US firm SiG Sauer amidst the ongoing heightened military tensions with China as well as the continuing delay in the project to manufacture Russian Kalashnikov rifles in India.

The 13-lakh strong Army has already inducted 72,400 SiG Sauer rifles, which are 7.62x51 mm caliber guns with an effective “kill” range of 500-metre, under a Rs 647 crore fast-track procurement (FTP) deal inked in February last year.

“The proposal for the second lot of SiG Sauer rifles is now being finalized for clearance by the defence acquisitions council (DAC) chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh ,” said a source.

India in March this year had also inked a Rs 880 crore deal to acquire 16,479 Israeli Negev 7.62x51 mm light machine guns (LMGs) for its frontline troops deployed on the borders with China and Pakistan . But the limited number of LMGs, like the SiG Sauer rifles, will also only meet partial requirements of the over 15-lakh strong armed forces.

The bulk of Army soldiers were slated to get 7.62x39 mm caliber AK-203 Kalashnikov rifles, with an effective range of 300-metre, to supplement the limited number of the more advanced US-origin rifles with a longer kill range.

But the much-touted ‘Make in India’ project to manufacture 6.71 lakh AK-203 rifles at Korwa ordnance factory in Amethi district of Uttar Pradesh has run into rough weather yet again, as was reported by TOI last month.

The defence ministry has now appointed a “costing committee” to fix a “reasonable price” for manufacturing AK-203s after the JV between Indian Ordnance Factory Board and Russian Rosonboronexport and Kalashnikov company quoted an “unreasonable and unacceptable” price for the rifles. The DAC, incidentally, had granted “acceptance of necessity” to procure 6,71,427 AK-203 rifles at an estimated cost of Rs 4,358 crore in January 2019.

The Army had first asked for new assault rifles and close-quarter battle (CQB) carbines for its 382 infantry battalions (with 850 soldiers each) way back in 2005, while the case for the LMGs was initiated in 2009.

But the long-drawn procurement projects were repeatedly derailed due to corruption allegations or framing of unrealistic technical parameters, with the lack of effective indigenous options also compounding the problem for over a decade.

The government in 2018 finally decided to procure limited quantities of assault rifles, CQB carbines and LMGs from abroad, with the huge shortfalls for the armed forces to be eventually met by indigenous production.

Apart from the SiG Sauer assault rifles, the Army last year also went in for emergency induction of 210 Israeli “Spike” anti-tank guided missiles and 12 launchers, which have a strike range of up to 4-km.

Similarly, the force has acquired over 30 sniper rifles, Beretta’s .338 Lapua Magnum Scorpio TGT and Barrett’s .50-calibre M95 guns, which have an effective kill range from 1,500 to 1,800-metre, for use along the 778-km long Line of Control with Pakistan, as was reported earlier by TOI.

MANALI: A day after Kullu police had recovered a country-made pistol from a Delhi man travelling in bus to Manali, two home guard jawans in night patrolling duty in Manali town have been assaulted by four persons while one jawan is shot by one of the accused.

A jawan Tikhu Ram in his statement said that he and Naresh Kumar were on patrolling duty in Model Town area of Manali when they had an argument with four persons. The home guard jawans had asked the four persons the reason of roaming in street at 1:30am when there was nobody else in the town. Later the men started arguing and one of them snatched the stick of home guard Naresh and started beating him. Tikhu Ram stated that one person took out a country-made pistol and shot at Naresh. All four accused fled from the spot after the gunfire.

The police have distributed a photo of the accused and have requested people, especially hoteliers, to share any clue about the accused.

This is worth mentioning that there are a large number of tourism units in Kullu Manali which are not registered and they generally do not maintain a proper database of the guests.

Budhi Prakash Thakur, a hotelier, alleged that a large number of hotels, guesthouses and even homestays are running without registration with tourism department. ""If criminals were staying in such properties, how will owner help the police. Some hoteliers not able to fulfil the difficult norms are struggling to get their properties registered while some are running business illegally. Government should take it seriously,"" he said.

KOLKATA: A day after a gynaecologist was assaulted at CMRI Hospital following the death of a young woman after childbrith, the Alipore police has registered an FIR on Friday against the accused under non-bailable sections to treat the assault as a cognizable offence.Police said they have slapped Section 4 of the West Bengal Protection of Medical Service Persons and Medical Service Institutions (Prevention of Violence and Damage or Loss of Property) Act, 2017 against the kin of the deceased based on a specific complaint from the doctor, Basab Mukherjee, who visited the police station on Thursday night and registered his written complaint.The development comes on the same day when sources claimed that the preliminary post mortem of the victim — Rinki Bhattacharya — primarily indicates pulmonary embolism (PE) leading to the cardiac arrest. PE is usually caused by blood clot that travels to the lungs of the person leading to blockage in one of the pulmonary arteries.“The preliminary post-mortem report does not point to any kind of dereliction on the part of the doctor,” said a source. Cops said the post-mortem report is critical to decide the fate of the case. The autopsy report will be submitted to the state health department as the woman’s family has lodged a complaint of medical negligence against the gynaecologist.Bhattacharya had given birth to a boy on Wednesday morning a little after 10am through C-section. Apparently fine after the childbirth, the death within 18 hours had led to her family alleging medical negligence.The FIR against the kin also has other IPC sections — 323 (hurt), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 114 (abettor present when offence is committed) — and has been forwarded to a city court. The police said the hospital has named an accused in their complaint, identified as Tapen Bhattacharya, the husband of the victim. A separate complaint has also been received in this regard from the hospital, said DC (south) Meeraz Khalid. The maximum punishment under the special law is imprisonment for a maximum of three years.“We will establish whether the same person is involved in the slapping incident,” said a senior officer. Sources said they will also follow legal procedures and ask the accused person to join the probe soon. “There is no pressing need for an arrest right now,” said the officer.The cops, meanwhile, said they have also received a complaint from the family claiming medical negligence. “According to norms, we have forwarded the complaint to the medical council. Once they give their views, we will lodge an FIR based on their recommendations,” said another officer.On Friday, various doctor organisations, including West Bengal Doctors’ Forum, visited the hospital asking the administration to pursue the case of assault on the doctor. “We will wait till the baby is discharged for the police to take action against Tapen Bhattacharya who assaulted the doctor. We demand arrest of the accused,” said oncologist Sharadwat Mukhopadhyay of DOPA (Doctors for Patients).The Bengal Obstetrics and Gynaecological Society (BOGS) has also decided to wait till the baby goes home before it decides on its next course of action. Meanwhile, hospital sources said the baby is doing fine and is likely to be discharged in the next few days.Bhattacharya, 30, a resident of Baguiati and wife of a businessman, was admitted to the hospital on Wednesday. Mukherjee conducted a C-section in the morning. Family members said the mother had appeared quite healthy when they saw her during the evening visiting hour.

BETTIAH/PATNA: Four Maoists were killed in an encounter with a joint team of Bihar Police’s special task force and Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) in the Valmiki Tiger Reserve (VTR) jungles bordering Nepal in West Champaran district on Friday morning. One policeman and an SSB inspector were injured in the shootout. The joint team recovered three SLRs, one AK-56 assault rifle and one .303 rifle from the spot.

DIG (Champaran Range) Lallan Mohan Prasad said the joint operation was conducted by the Special Task Force of Bagaha police and the SSB on inputs received that Maoists were moving in the jungles. Deputy commandant Narpat Singh led the SSB’s ‘small action team’, SSB Patna frontier IG Sanjay Kumar said, adding the injured Rituraj was out of danger.

The slain Maoists were identified as Vipul from Muzaffarpur, Kiran, Nakul and Chhotey Sahni alias Suraj. Suraj is from Valmikinagar. Vipul had been arrested in 2018 for the murder of Champapur-Gonauli panchayat mukhiya Manoj Singh in the VTR region. He was out on bail.

“Bagaha SP Rajeev Ranjan has rushed in with reinforcements to intensify the combing operations made difficult by overnight rain that has brought the jungle rivulets in spate and made the dense jungle terrain sluggish,” the DIG said.

IG Kumar said the four Maoists were from ‘Rajan’s Dasta’. Another senior SSB officer said Nakul was the right hand and bodyguard of Maoist commander Ram Babu Ram alias Rajan.

STF sources said it was a big setback for Ram and his cadre and a major success for police and SSB in north Bihar before the upcoming assembly election. “Ram is a member of Uttar Pradesh-Uttar Bihar Special Area Committee (UU-SAC) of the CPI (Maoist),” a senior STF officer said. “His ‘dasta’ had 12 armed cadres and four of them have been neutralized,” he added.

The encounter took place near Chautha nallah, about 30km northeast of Bagaha. This is one of the nine streams that flow perpendicular from the Bhapsa river running through the thick forests. In 2017, VTR authorities had refurbished an 18km-long jungle path from Harnataar to Naurangia Done to facilitate all-weather commute for the villagers around Naurangia. This road is the only connect for these forest villagers in the midst of VTR between Harnataar and Bagaha. About 10km of this road lies in the core area of the Tiger reserve. Chautha nallah flows through this core area, away from human habitation.

In 2015-16, a case of tiger poaching had been reported from the vicinity of Chautha nallah, but investigations found local involvement in the crime. VTR authorities subsequently rebuilt the all-weather jungle road. An anti-poaching camp was set up on the border of the Gonauli and Naurangia forest ranges on this road. Poaching has since been checked.

The Friday’s encounter has brought the focus back on the VTR jungles as a possible Moist hotbed after over 15 years’ hiatus. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, these jungles had been a refuge of Maoists from Telangana/Andhra Pradesh, too. Across the border, Nepal then was in the midst of the Communists’ ‘jan andolan’.

Times View Things have been improving after the measures taken following the NRS violence but this incident may prove to be a setback. Violence on hospital campuses hurts all stakeholders and every incident like this contributes to the gradual erosion of trust that should be the bedrock of the doctor-patient relationship.

KOLKATA: The husband of a young woman, who died hours after she gave birth to a healthy boy, assaulted the gynaecologist who had delivered the baby at CMRI Hospital on Thursday morning, sparking widespread anger in the medical fraternity, with doctors seeking strict punishment for the accused.Rinki Bhattacharya, 30, was admitted to the hospital on Wednesday, where ob-gyn Basab Mukherjee conducted a C-section to deliver a boy in the morning. Family members said the mother had appeared quite healthy when they saw her during the evening visiting hour. But the Baguiati resident developed severe respiratory distress around 3am on Thursday and died of a cardiac arrest soon after.The family demanded an explanation from the doctor. Mukherjee was in the process of explaining the possible cause of her death, when her husband, Tapen Bhattacharya, lashed out and slapped him on the left cheek. The impact of the blow sent the doctor reeling. Uniformed policemen were present when the assault, captured on CCTV cameras, took place.Coming barely eight months after the vicious mob assault at NRS Medical College and Hospital on two junior doctors, the single slap on Thursday resounded far widely than just in the corridors of CMRI. News of the assault sent ripples through the medical fraternity. The NRS incident led to protracted protests and a government assurance on a clampdown on such attacks. The CMRI assault has again touched a raw nerve.Rinki had been under Basab Mukherjee’s care since she became pregnant. Accordingly, she was admitted to CMRI, with which the doctor is attached. The baby was delivered a little after 10am on Wednesday. The rest of the day was normal. According to hospital authorities, she suddenly complained of severe respiratory distress around 3am on Thursday and died of a cardiac arrest despite critical care support.Her relatives, who arrived early on Thursday, were initially stunned to learn of the death and began asking questions about what had happened to Rinki, since she was apparently in perfect health just a few hours ago. When the RMO’s explanations failed to satisfy them, the message was conveyed to Mukherjee, who volunteered to speak to the family. “The doctor arrived at the hospital earlier than usual when he learnt that the family wanted an explanation. He said he would try to explain what happened,” said a hospital source.The doctor then entered the patients’ counselling room and began speaking to a dozen-odd relatives of the deceased. As a precautionary measure, the hospital also called in the police, and two constables were present in the room. “The doctor was explaining the possible causes of death. When the relatives failed to see reason, he suggested an autopsy to determine the cause. It was at this point that the husband sprang up from a chair, leapt towards the doctor and slapped him on the face. The suddenness of the attack caught both the cops and the hospital security personnel unawares,” said a hospital staff.According to the family, Tapen turned furious at what he felt was “medical jargon”, instead of explaining in “simple terms” what had happened. “The doctor was trying to camouflage medical negligence with medical terms that none of us could understand,” alleged a family member. Tapen later said he was distraught and beyond himself on learning of the shocking loss. “How would anybody else have reacted under this circumstance?” Family members said Tapen later expressed remorse.The couple had got married two years ago, and this was their first child. According to relatives, their association with Dr Mukherjee’s family goes way back. Basudeb Mukherjee, his father, is also a gynaecologist and had helped deliver several newborns in the family, they said. “The death was unfortunate. However, physical violence on a doctor is unacceptable and will not be endured by the hospital,” read a statement by the hospital, which lodged a assault complaint with Alipore PS. Dr Mukherjee, too, has lodged an assault complaint with the cops.In Video: On cam: Man slaps doctor in Kolkata after relative dies following childbirth"

On Tuesday evening, the woman was feeding stray dogs. The man, who was passing by, reportedly made remarks which she could overhear.

“Day before yesterday, when I was feeding the dogs, Anirudh Bhardwaj came and started making some unwanted remarks. That day, I ignored him. He was apparently drunk. On Tuesday, when I was feeding the strays, he tried to grope me. When I pushed him away, he scratched my back and my chest,” the woman told TOI.

“A teenager who was passing by with his dog saw this and tried to help me. He slapped the boy and dragged him inside his house and then took him to the terrace and locked it up.

LONDON: "" Harry Potter "" author JK Rowling revealed on Wednesday she has been a victim of domestic abuse and sexual assault.

The celebrated British writer said in a blog post that she was disclosing the information to give context to her controversial past comments about transgender women.

""This isn't an easy piece to write,"" Rowling said in a 3,695-word essay on gender identity and her own troubled past.

""I've been in the public eye now for over twenty years and have never talked publicly about being a domestic abuse and sexual assault survivor,"" Rowling wrote.

""This isn't because I'm ashamed those things happened to me, but because they're traumatic to revisit and remember.""

Rowling caused a scandal by tweeting last weekend about ""people who menstruate"".

""I'm sure there used to be a word for those people. Someone help me out. Wumben? Wimpund? Woomud?""

The tweet forced ""Harry Potter"" star Daniel Radcliffe to apologise to trans women who may have been offended by Rowling's remark.

""Transgender women are women,"" Radcliffe wrote in a post for The Trevor Project website.

The feud dated back to comments from December in which Rowling expressed support for a woman who had lost her job over what her employer deemed to be ""transphobic"" tweets.

Rowling said on Wednesday that ""accusations and threats from trans activists have been bubbling in my Twitter timeline"" ever since.

""Huge numbers of women are justifiably terrified by the trans activists; I know this because so many have got in touch with me to tell their stories,"" she wrote.

Rowling ended her post by affirming that she was ""a survivor (and) certainly not a victim"".

""I haven't written this essay in the hope that anybody will get out a violin for me, not even a teeny-weeny one,"" she said.

""I've only mentioned my past because, like every other human being on this planet, I have a complex backstory, which shapes my fears, my interests and my opinions.""

Rowling said she had spent many years thinking about trans issues because of her own troubles with gender identity when she was young.

""When I read about the theory of gender identity, I remember how mentally sexless I felt in youth,"" she wrote.

""As I didn't have a realistic possibility of becoming a man back in the 1980s, it had to be books and music that got me through both my mental health issues and the sexualised scrutiny and judgement that sets so many girls to war against their bodies in their teens.""

The 54-year-old said she spent a period feeling ""ambivalence about being a woman"" before learning that ""it's OK to feel confused, dark, both sexual and non-sexual, unsure of what or who you are"".

She also argued that ""the current explosion of trans activism"" has resulted in too many people undergoing gender reassignment surgery without giving it sufficient thought.

""I want to be very clear here: I know transition will be a solution for some gender dysphoric people, although I'm also aware through extensive research that studies have consistently shown that between 60-90 percent of gender dysphoric teens will grow out of their dysphoria,"" she said.

""So I want trans women to be safe. At the same time, I do not want to make... girls and women less safe.""

But she also stood up for her right to speak freely about an issue that she said has been with her throughout life.

""As a much-banned author, I'm interested in freedom of speech and have publicly defended it, even unto Donald Trump,"" she wrote.

Rowling's books have been banned in parts of the world because of their association in some cultures with witchcraft and the occult.

LUDHIANA: More than two months after Punjab DGP Dinkar Gupta ordered an inquiry into an alleged assault of three persons and making them stand nude at a police station in Khanna, the police have booked a former SHO and a constable in connection with the case.

Later, Khanna SSP Harpreet Singh had marked the inquiry to Khanna SP (headquarters) Tejinder Singh.

The SSP Khanna confirmed that a case under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 342 (wrongful confinement) of the IPC, and under the provisions of SC/ST Act and IT Act has been registered against the duo. The accused would be arrested in a day or two, he added.

The SSP said constable Varun has been booked under the IT Act, as his mobile phone was used to make the video.

Another police officer said a special investigation team (SIT) has been constituted, comprising the Ludhiana Range IG, Ludhiana Rural SSP and a SP-rank officer, for further probe into the case.

KOLHAPUR: Four people, including a sitting member of a grampanchyat of Khatangle village, have been booked for allegedly assaulting an Asha worker after she refused to give them extra vials of a homeopathy medicine recommended by the Ayush ministry to improve immunity against Covid-19.

While one of the four suspects, Eknath Patil, has been arrested, the grampanchayat member and two others are on the run. Prashant Amrutkar, deputy superintendent of police, said, “We have deployed two teams to trace the suspects on the run. Attack on health workers will not be tolerated.”

Shobha Ashok Talekar (52) was visiting every household and distributing the medicine. As per her complaint lodged at Karveer police station, Talekar said that the health workers were given a list of the senior citizens to whom the vials had to be given free of cost. While visiting the house of a gram panchayat member, the family members demanded additional vials. When Talekar refused to give in to their demand, they assaulted her.

On learning about the incident, Asha workers from across Karveer taluka have stopped their work, which mainly includes delivering medicines and conducting door-to-door survey to identify Covid-19 suspects.

Netradipa Patil, district head of Asha workers association said, that Talekar was so badly assaulted that she bore beating marks on her body and scratches on her head. She was immediately taken to Chhatrapati Pramila Raje Hospital for treatment.

“So far, there have been seven instances of misbehaviour with Asha workers. They were either abused or assaulted but no action has been taken so far. Considering past experiences, we have taken the decision to discontinue the work till all the accused are not arrested,” said Patil.

SAN FRANCISCO: California authorities have charged more than 100 people with looting, assault and other crimes committed during and around protests while police in a San Francisco Bay Area city said Wednesday that a break-in suspect died after being shot by police who mistook his hammer for a gun.

More than 3,000 people have been arrested in Los Angeles County since protests began last week, most accused of curfew violations.

The county produced the lion's share of those charged with 61. Sacramento County has filed charges against 43 people and Orange County brought felony cases against two men, accusing one of trying to steal a police car and another of assaulting an officer by throwing rocks and bottles during demonstrations.

Los Angeles District District Attorney Jackie Lacey has been criticized for reluctance to bring charges against police officers for misconduct. At some Los Angeles protests demonstrators have chanted for her to be removed.

She said she supports peaceful protests “that already have brought needed attention to racial inequality throughout our society, including in the criminal justice system” but has a duty to “prosecute people who loot and vandalize our community.” The charges were in crimes committed during sometimes violent protests and looting last weekend and Monday. Since then there has been much less crime and the demonstrations have taken on a more upbeat atmosphere. Local leaders and police have sometimes taken knees with demonstrators.

NBA stars Steph Curry and Klay Thompson marched with protesters in Oakland on Wednesday while peaceful protests attracting many thousands were held in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Many other communities had smaller demonstrations.

As flashes of violence and break-ins dwindle, some California counties and cities shortened curfew hours or announced plans to end them.

Los Angeles County pushed back the start of its curfew from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m., a help to newly reopened restaurants and retail stores that were shut down for weeks by anti-coronavirus orders.

“It's just killing my dinner service. But I believe the curfew helps thin out the crowds,” said Darren Melamed, owner of Pizza World restaurant that was spared the major damage that hit dozens of neighboring businesses in the Fairfax District.

San Francisco will lift its curfew Thursday morning, Mayor London Breed announced. She ordered the daily 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew after widespread break-ins and theft Saturday night, but some supervisors said they were disturbed by restrictions on free speech.

“Following Saturday night, it was important for the safety of our residents to ensure that we could prevent the violence and vandalism that had taken place, but we know that the overwhelming majority of people out protesting are doing so peacefully and we trust that will continue,” Breed said.

San Jose also will lift its curfew Thursday morning, while Alameda County planned to end the one there Friday at 5 a.m. Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf said the city will reluctantly keep its 8 p.m. curfew in place indefinitely, though police are being judicious about detaining protesters.

The San Francisco Bay Area city of Vallejo has been a significant exception as other cities become more peaceful. Fifty members of the National Guard arrived Tuesday night amid a second straight day of violence, break-ins and theft.

On Wednesday, Police Chief Shawny Williams released details of the police shooting that killed Sean Monterrosa, 22, of San Francisco.

The chief said officers responding to calls of looting at a Walgreens around 1 a.m. Tuesday confronted about a dozen people in the parking lot. One of the suspect's cars rammed into a police vehicle.

Officers spotted Monterrosa near the building with what appeared to be a weapon in his waistband and opened fire. The suspected gun turned out to be a hammer, Williams said.

Monterrosa's death prompted renewed calls against police brutality. Critics peppered a brief press conference by Williams, saying this was exactly the kind of police action they are protesting.

John Burris, an attorney for Monterrosa's family, said the victim “was shot multiple times while he was on his knees and appeared to be trying to surrender.” Elsewhere Wednesday, Gov. Gavin Newsom made a low-key visit to Los Angeles.

He helped pack lunches for a senior meal program and toured a black-owned business. He applauded additional charges that were filed against Minneapolis police in the killing of George Floyd but also said institutional racism and other problems need to be confronted.

“This is so much bigger than the tragic death and loss of one individual,” he said. “This is the cumulative neglect of decades, centuries in this country that needs to be addressed.” In the state capital, Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg and Police Chief Daniel Hahn took a knee in honor of Floyd and marched with a few hundred demonstrators through scorching heat to a church.

Steinberg said an 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew will extend through the weekend.

“I say that very reluctantly, but we want to make sure that everybody, including protesters, are safe,” he said.

“To get through the next few days and then to start fresh on Monday, we believe is the best thing.” Steinberg said most local business owners are not upset about the curfew, though he acknowledged the “double whammy” many are facing following stay-at-home coronavirus orders. (AP)

AHMEDABAD: A Ghatlodia resident on Tuesday filed a complaint with city police alleging that his daughter’s former business partner had assaulted and threatened to kill him over a dispute with her daughter.

In his FIR with Ghatlodia police, Chandrakant Thakkar, 57, resident of Shyamratna Apartment in Ghatlodia, said that his daughter Puja, 31, is into share market business. In February this year, Puja had some dispute with her previous partner, Jaimin Thakkar.

As Jaimin had conducted some irregularities, Puja had filed a plea before police. At that time, Milan Thakkar, the accused in the present case, had approached Puja and convinced her to strike a compromise with Jaimin.

After striking a compromise, Puja began doing the share market business with Milan, who was also into the same business. Due to some unknown reasons, Puja had stopped talking with Milan for past two months, states the FIR.

This did not go well with Milan who began harassing Puja and threatening her with dire consequences if she did not talk with him, states the FIR. When Puja told her father about Milan’s threats and harassment, Chandrakant told Milan not to harass his daughter. Milan, at that time, apologized for his mistake.

However, on Tuesday afternoon, he again came to Chandrakant’s medical store in Ghatlodia area and began abusing and assaulting him. He even threatened Chandrakant that if Puja did not talk with him, then he would kill him in public. Later, Chandrakant filed an FIR with Ghatlodia police.

MUMBAI: J J Marg police on Friday booked two sons of Dawood Ibrahim , along with two others, for allegedly assaulting a civil contractor who had bagged the demolition contract of a dilapidated building at Sitaphulwadi in Bhendi Bazaar.

The brothers, Imran and Nabeel Khan, sources said, were eyeing the project. Their father, Hanif Khan, alias Hanif Kutta, was Dawood's close aide. Hanif had died in Dubai in 2000 due to kidney failure.

In his police complaint, the victim's father Aslam Ansari said: ""On Thursday, my son Danish was riding to work on his bike when Nabeel and his men accosted him. They hurled abuses at him and when he objected, they hit him with iron rods and fled."" He alleged that Nabeel and his men had acted at the behest of Imran who wanted Danish to give up the contract.

The police filed an FIR against Imran, Nabeel and two others under the relevant sections of the IPC for assault, voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means and intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace.

In 2019, Imran, a history-sheeter, had accused a senior inspector of J J Marg police station of demanding a bribe of Rs 2 lakh to not take action against him in a case registered under the Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Slumlords, Bootleggers, Drug Offenders and Dangerous Persons Act.

AURANGABAD: Newspaper vendors, who came to the Jatwada corner near Aurangabad Central Prison to collect the newspaper bundles, were assaulted by policemen early on Friday.

The incident has left two vendors – Bhagwat Gaikwad and Sarang Nikam – seriously injured. The police action drew criticism from all quarters soon after the photographs of injured vendors went viral on social media.

Senior police officers, including commissioner of police Chiranjeev Prasad, on more than one occasion, had issued instructions to policemen asking them to abstain from using force against citizens, especially those belonging to the essential service provider category.

A preliminary probe has revealed that the policemen, who allegedly committed the act, belonged to Begumpura police station. Senior authorities from the said police station said it would be too early to comment as the said policemen have not been identified.

Meanwhile, agitated newspaper vendors, led by their association president Nilesh Fatke, went to the city police commissionerate and lodged a written complaint with assistant commissioner of police (crime) Nagnath Kode.

The vendors also threatened to go on an indefinite strike if strict action is not taken against the policeman. The vendors pointed out that the lockdown exemption pass allotted to them were also snatched by the policemen.

It was alleged that milkmen and vegetable vendors, including a 60-year-old elderly woman, were also assaulted by these policemen who appeared to be in an inebriated state.

Taking cognizance of the incident, deputy commissioner of police (zone-I) Nikesh Khatmode-Patil, to ensure an unbiased probe, has tasked the detection branch of the City Chowk police station to carry out an internal probe and identify the miscreant policemen before disciplinary action is initiated against them.

‘Girl had no reason to lie about sex assault’

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

MUMBAI: A special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act court has sentenced a van driver to 10 years’ imprisonment for sexually assaulting a six-year-old girl twice near her Andheri school in 2016. The court observed that the testimony of the victim (now 10) was fluent and without embellishments. The convict, Abdul Rehman, was also fined Rs 15,000. Of this, Rs 10,000 will be given to the girl.On February 11, 2016, the girl was in the school playground when a man dragged her away and sexually assaulted her. On her return home, she looked upset and her mother found stains on her innerwear. On repeated prodding, the girl revealed that an uncle had touched her inappropriately. The man sexually assaulted the girl again the next day. This time, he even threatened to kill her parents. The child went to a teacher and they tried to find the man, in vain.On returning home, the girl confided in her mother, who, along with a neighbour, went to the school. Rehman was standing at the school gate, and the girl identified him. On spotting the girl’s mother making note of his van’s registration number, the driver fled. The girl’s parents then approached the school management and lodged a police complaint a few days later.The convict claimed before the court that he was not present when the alleged incident occurred, but the court observed that he couldn’t produce witnesses to substantiate his claim. The court also observed though there were cameras in the school, the principal said they were of poor quality, and more cameras had been installed only after the incident.A medical officer told the court that no injury was found on the victim’s private parts. At this, judge H C Shende said, “The reason for me to believe the victim’s testimony is the medical officer’s explanation that due to her tender age and the time gap, healing process could be rapid.”“The court took into account there was no reason for a child to falsely accuse a man of sexual assault. Her family wasn’t acquainted with him and she did not commute by his van,” said prosecutor G Malankar. “The victim and her family had to move out of Mumbai because of the trauma.”Rehman’s counsel sought leniency as he had three dependents. “The victim was only six years old. What was her fault?” judge Shende said."

Madras high court

MADURAI: Madras high court has set aside the conviction and sentence imposed on a man who assaulted a police constable in Madurai in 1997, saying the trial court had not examined important witnesses.

The prosecution case is that constable Rathinamani of Teppakulam police received a phone call informing him that a person was being assaulted by seven others at Kuruvikaran Salai on March 28, 1997. When Rathinamani and an SI were searching for the accused in the southern and northern banks of Vaigai river, one of the accused, appellant Sikkandar, assaulted him using a sickle in which he sustained injuries.

Following the incident, the police registered a case against Sikkandar and he was arrested. The fast track court in Madurai convicted and sentenced him to undergo three years imprisonment under section 332 (voluntarily causes hurt to any person being a public servant in the discharge of his duty as such public servant) of IPC on June 30, 2009. Sikkandar moved HC Madurai bench the same year challenging the order.

On perusal of the submissions, Justice B Pugalendhi observed that the police constable was assaulted by a rowdy element and the complainant is the same police constable. “Even though the investigation was conducted in such a shabby manner, the trial was concluded even without examining the relevant witnesses for arrest and recovery as well as the doctor who provided treatment to the constable,” he said.

Though an SI accompanied the constable at the time of occurrence, the person was also not examined. Hence the judge noted that it was not safe to sustain the conviction and sentence and acquitted the appellant of the charges framed against him.

Trichy: Regional joint director of collegiate education (RJDCE), Trichy, S Usha, who was accused of physically assaulting subordinate staff two weeks ago, has been posted as the RJDCE of Thanjavur.

Higher education secretary Apoorva passed an order to this effect on Tuesday. T Arivudainambi, RJDCE of Thanjavur has been appointed as the new Trichy RJDCE.

The decision from the higher education department has come under criticism from teachers’ organisations who charged the department of ignoring the safety of its staff at workplace.

On February 13, all the 20 staff at the RJDCE office, Trichy staged a protest alleging that Usha had physically assaulted stenographer Rajeswari and office superintendent Savariyammal Brisca Mary.

Rajeswari, who was allegedly slapped by Usha, was so traumatized that she had to be admitted to a hospital for treatment.

The staff members wrote to the higher education secretary, director of collegiate education and the higher education minister about the incident seeking an inquiry. They also met governor Banwarilal Purohit and submitted a memorandum seeking an inquiry into the incident.

Usha went on forced leave the very next day, and two weeks later she has been transferred to Thanjavur, her home town.

Stating that the decision from the higher education department will set a bad precedence, general secretary of Aided College Teachers Association (ACTA) S Sahaya Sathish said Usha has been demanding a transfer to Thanjavur.

Now, she has been given transfer following the incident, which can only be construed as a reward for her act. There has not been any inquiry into the complaint lodged by the victims, he said.

AUT general secretary M S Balamurugan said that the transfer cannot be considered as punishment, as this is not the first such case against her.

Earlier, there were complaints of verbal abuse by her on staff.

However, no action was taken against her then and she was reinstated to the same post two weeks later.

According to the complaint, the contractor and his accomplices allegedly assaulted Birare with an iron rod and one of the suspects allegedly assaulted Birare’s friend leaving him with head injury.

The complainant has stated that after MLA Shirsath intervened and tried to console, the suspect threatened him too.

The cross-complaint was registered within hours of the offence being registered against Shirshath, the Aurangabad west MLA, deputy mayor Rajendra Janjal and three others.

The MLA refuted the allegations and said that the contractor, who is an office-bearer of Shiv Sena, was interested in bagging a contract for works to the tune of Rs 10 crore in the Satara Deolai area, and started creating hurdles after failing to bag the contract.

A police officer said that as both the offences registered are bailable in nature, police would prefer initiating preventive action, that too after finding concrete evidence in both the complaints.

BHUBANESWAR: Baghamari police in Khurda district registered a case against BJD MLA from Bhubaneswar-Central constituency Ananta Narayan Jena on Wednesday for allegedly misbehaving with a woman on Tuesday. Police, however, on Thursday gave a clean chit to the ruling party MLA and said the charges against him were false.

“We had received the complaint of assault and misbehaviour with a woman against the MLA and two of his associates. We immediately registered a case against the three persons . But, during inquiry we found that the woman lodged false case against them. She wanted to settle a score with the MLA in a personal case,” Khurda SP Ajay Pratap Swain told TOI.

Jena was booked under sections 448 (house trespass), 294 (obscene act), 354-B (assault on woman with intent to disrobe), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 34 (crime committed by several persons) of IPC.

Police said the woman complainant was aggrieved and vindictive following arrest of her husband for allegedly attacking Jena’s relative following a dispute on Tuesday. “We had arrested the woman’s husband and another person for attacking the MLA’s relative (a retired army officer). The duo attacked the ex-army officer as he denied to pay them extortion. The duo had also been harassing the ex-army officer for carrying farming on his land,” the Khurda SP said.

Contacted, Jena refuted the allegations. “The woman’s husband along with his henchmen attacked my close family relative. I rushed to Baghamari village and accompanied him to the police station to lodge a complaint. Since police took action against the woman’s husband, she framed me in the false case.

MUMBAI: A 32-year-old female ' beggar ' who was arrested on charges of attacking a woman police constable on the bridge at Dadar railway station in April, has been acquitted after a sessions court observed she was falsely implicated in the case.

Constable Maya Mane had claimed the accused, Ayesha Badwala, had attacked her when she reasoned with her not to beg. Badwala's defence said an unknown person pushed Mane on the bridge, but the enraged constable caught hold of the accused and assaulted her. Badwala, a domestic help, was arrested on April 10. However, despite being granted bail, she continued to remain in jail as she failed to furnish the surety of Rs 5,000.

She was provided a state-appointed lawyer to defend herself.

In the detailed judgment copy acquitting Badwala, the court reasoned that in comparison to Mane, Badwala was slim and feeble. ""It is highly improbable that a feeble lady would retaliate against the mighty police personnel. Considering the physique of the accused, it is sheer impossible for her to touch the informant (Mane), leave apart catching hold of the collar (of Mane) and assaulting (her),"" the court said.

Further, the court also said nothing was found on Badwala during her search. ""The alleged incident occurred around 3pm. The accused would have gathered some amount if she was begging. However, nothing was recovered at the instance of the accused which falsifies the prosecution case,"" the court said.

It was the prosecution's case that on April 10, Mane was on patrolling duty at Matunga railway station. She and two other police officials found a minor girl wandering alone and took her to Dadar crime branch. It was submitted the incident occurred while Mane was on the public bridge at Dadar. Mane claimed she spotted Badwala begging on the crowded bridge and objected to it when the accused caught her collar and slapped her. She claimed the two other cops came to her rescue and took Badwala to the police station.

However, the court said while Mane had claimed the incident took place on the bridge, one of the two cops who was purportedly with her, had told the court the incident occurred on the slope of platforms three and four. ""There is no independent witness to support the prosecution in the light of self-interested version of the informant. In view of aforesaid contradictory evidence, possibility of false implication of accused is eminent. As such accused deserves benefit of doubt,"" the court held. It also noted the investigator did not collect a copy of the movement register or any other document to show why Mane was sent to Dadar railway station.

Such assault on doctors could be as infectious as the coronavirus. Today, it has happened at CMRI. Tomorrow, it will happen in other hospitals. Every death is unfortunate. But how can a doctor be assaulted every time there is a death? If things go like this, doctors will be scared to operate on patients,” said SSKM Hospital hepatology head Abhijit Chowdhury, who termed the slapping incident a criminal offence.Some doctors said patient Rinki Bhattacharya could have developed pulmonary embolism after childbirth. In such a case, blood clot forms inside a vein and travel to the lung, causing cardiac arrest with high mortality rate. Others, though, felt only a post-mortem could determine the exact cause, something that Basab Mukherjee had himself suggested.“Even doctors with superb clinical skills can make mistakes. Mukherjee rightly suggested a post-mortem to determine the cause of death. The assault was absolutely uncalled for,” said gynaecologist Dibyendu Banerjee, president of Bengal Obstetrics and Gynaecological Society (BOGS).Members of BOGS that has demanded stringent action against the culprit while urging the authorities concerned to carry out a thorough investigation into the cause of the patient’s death, expressed shock that Mukherjee, known for his soft-skills, deep knowledge and polite behaviour, was at the receiving end of the assault.Condemning the incident, doctors said the authorities needed to act tough against the perpetrators to send a clear message that violence would not be tolerated in hospitals. “The slap on the face of this doctor is a slap on the face of the medical community. Sadly, cops were present during the assault. They remained spectators. People who saw the CCTV footage of the assault in front of uniformed men will believe they can get away with anything,” said ENT specialist Arjun Dasgupta of West Bengal Doctors’ Forum (WBDF).Doctors’ bodies cutting across political lines have threatened a stir if the administration did not punish the attacker. Associations like WBDF and Service Doctors’ Forum said they would wait for the police response before deciding on their next course of action. Doctors for Patients (DOPA) has asked the medical fraternity to brace up for protests.Thursday’s incident ended an eight-month lull that had followed a series of attacks on doctors and hospital vandalism. The government had last June adopted a slew of measures to prevent such assaults, mainly in government hospitals after the NRS Hospital incident in which junior doctors were assaulted by a mob.“We will not take this incident lightly and request our members and doctors of all other organisations to prepare for an agitation,” said a DOPA release."

Bhubaneswar: Taking stringent view of alleged police brutality on lockdown violators, Odisha Special on Monday suspended two of its armed police constables after videos surfaced showing them assaulting and harassing some people.

The constables, Suryakant Samantray and Pradyumna Kumar Samal, were seen making people kneel on the road, beating them and even forcing some to carry their bicycles on their shoulders for stepping out during the nationwide lockdown.

Deputy inspector general of police (northern range) Himanshu Kumar Lal said the two constables were suspended based on preliminary inquiry. “We are ensuring strict enforcement of social distancing in all the areas. Some people are seen violating the lockdown norms. But we have asked the police not to be harsh on the people,” Lal said.

On Sunday, A Mohanty, chairman of state telecom disaster coordination committee wrote a letter to all the district SPs urging them to sensitise the lower-rung police personnel not to beat thrash the telecom staff who are engaged in emergency work. “It has come to our notice that the police are beating the staff of various telecommunication services,” the letter stated.

PUNE: A tailor’s tag stitched on a deceased man’s shirt and trousers helped the Pimpri Chinchwad crime branch to solve his murder and detain three minors.

The police said the deceased man — Dattatreya Macharla (41), a power loom worker from Bhiwandi — was bludgeoned to death when he was walking home from Solapur district because he did not get any transport due to the lockdown. “The minors who were also walking towards Mumbai, killed him as they wanted money. However, they found only Rs500 and his cell phone with him,” assistant inspector of the crime branch Ram Gomare said.

Gomare said the trio was from Telangana . “One of the minors has a criminal record,” he said.

On June 8, morning walkers noticed a blood-soaked man lying unconscious on the bridge at Dehu Road. He was taken to a hospital, where he succumbed to the injuries around 9am. “We did not have any clues to ascertain the man’s identity, except tags of a tailor stitched on his shirt and trousers. There was a tailor’s name and ‘BWD’ written on the tag,” Gomare said.

After confirming ‘BWD’ stood for Bhiwandi, Gomare and his team rushed there. “There were 25 tailors in Bhiwandi with a similar name. We visited all of them and managed to find the victim’s name,” he said.

Macharla’s family told the police that before the lookdown, he had gone to his native place in Solapur district to attend a relative’s funeral, following which he was stuck there. “On June 1, he had started walking home from Solapur,” Gomare said.

The police got Macharla’s cellphone number and found out that after June 8, one call had been made to Telangana from his cellphone. “We went to Telangana and traced the person. He told us that his son had called him. But, he did not know his son’s location,” Gomare said.

The police got the man to Pimpri Chinchwad last week. “On Sunday, his son contacted him again from another number, which was from Yavat. We went there and took the minor and two others into custody,” he said.

The investigation revealed that the minors wanted to go to Mumbai to join a criminal gang. They left Telangana and reached Nigdi on June 8 by taking lifts from vehicles and walking. “On the same day Macharla too had reached Nigdi. They met at Bhakti Shakti Chowk and decided to walk together,” Gomare said.

On the way, the trio demanded money from Marcharla. He hardly had any money with him so he refused. Angered by this, the trio decided to kill him and rob him. “Late at night, when they reached the bridge at Dehu Road, Macharla decided to take a nap. As soon as he went to sleep, the trio bludgeoned him with a big stone and robbed Rs500 and his cellphone,” Gomare said.

After the murder, they reached Mumbai but had to return to Pune as they were not allowed to stay there. “They had started working at a jaggery-making unit in Yavat,” Gomare said.

7 minors detained for creating ruckus at Pimple Nilakh

The Pimpri Chinchwad crime branch on Monday arrested four youths and detained seven minors for assaulting four persons with sharp weapons and damaging eight parked vehicles in Pimple Nilakh on Sunday.

Assistant inspector of the crime branch, Ambarish Deshmukh, said the attack was a fallout of an old rivalry. “The kingpin of the gang is a minor, who had a fallout with the complainant — Rajkumar Pillay (25) of Pimple Nilakh — about a month ago over a trivial issue. The attack was orchestrated by the minor and his aides to settle scores,” Deshmukh said.

Pillay lodged a complaint with the Sangvi police in this regard following the attack on him and his three friends around 10.30pm on Sunday.

Deshmukh said that Pillay, along with his friends, was heading towards Sharada Colony when the suspects attacked him with sharp weapons. “They also damaged eight vehicles in the area before fleeing the spot,” he said.

Aurangabad: Registering strong objection to the alleged thrashing of petrol pump staffers heading to work, the petroleum dealers association (PDA) of Aurangabad has registered a complaint with the commissioner of police and district supply office.

The latest incident took place a couple of days after the state director general of police (DGP) Subodh Kumar Jaiswal issuing directives to all commissioners and superintendents of police, asking them to abstain from using force or assaulting the citizens.

As per the list issued by the state and central governments, fuel stations have been designated as essential services. PDA district secretary Aqueel Abbas said, “If this unwarranted assaulting of petrol pump staff continues then it will be difficult for us to continue operating the fuel stations. The staffers are refusing to come to work due to the alleged thrashing by police during the ongoing lockdown .”

On Saturday, the petrol pump staffers were thrashed by police in the railway station, Begumpura and City Chowk areas even though they were carrying valid identity cards.

“There were clear instructions not to use force against any person stepping out for genuine reason. I will personally look into it and appropriate action will be taken,” Chiranjeev Prasad, commissioner of police, said.

Himanshu was hit in the face

GURUGRAM: A car owner and two of his friends allegedly beat up a man working at the Gurugram-Faridabad toll plaza when he asked them to pay the fee. The accused damaged the toll booth before fleeing.

On Friday around 11 pm, the car, that did not have a registration number, was stopped at the toll booth. When Himanshu Mishra, who was on shift, asked the driver to share the registration details, the man who claimed to be a resident of Bhandwari village, turned violent. He, along with two of his friends, assaulted Mishra and sped away without paying toll.

“The car reached lane number 14. The driver identified himself as Rahul. He was asked to share the registration details to be recorded in the system and this is when the driver and two of his friends stepped out of the car and attacked Mishra,” said toll manager Pawan Sharma adding that Mishra has sustained injuries to his face and nose.

Hearing the commotion, toll staff from other lanes came to Mishra’s rescue. He was taken to a private hospital in the area.

The villages around the toll plaza are exempted from paying toll but registration details of each vehicle are uploaded in the system

Around 52,000 vehicles cross the plaza every day and incidents like this is not uncommon. The toll manager submitted a complaint along with the CCTV footage of the incident to the police. “A case has been registered at DLF Phase-I police station. With the help of footage, we are trying to trace the accused,” said police spokesperson Subhash Boken, adding that the accused will be arrested at the earliest.

AHMEDABAD: During the lockdown, a 45-year old working woman from Vastrapur who is employed in a bank decided to call it quits on her married life. With offices closed and maids not allowed by the society to curb the spread of corona pandemic, she took upon herself the responsibility of doing all domestic chores.

“Her in-laws, however, picked faults in her work resulting in frequent skirmishes and eventually physical assault ,” said an Abhayam 181 counsellor.

While lockdown proved to be a blessing for many families who got to spend quality time with each other, it opened the proverbial Pandora's box of the domestic kind for many women who found themselves at the receiving end of verbal and physical abuse.

In fact, data shared by Abhayam 181 helpline for women revealed that during 69 days of lockdown in Gujarat, the phones literally rang off the hook with 9,420 women calling to report domestic violence – including physical and verbal abuse. This translates to nearly one call every 10 minutes!

Compared to the average 129 daily calls received in January and February, the calls rose to 136 per day during lockdown. The first eight days of lockdown in March recorded 87 daily cases in Gujarat which shot up to 148 daily in May recording a significant jump of 70%.

Jashvant Prajapati, COO, EMRI Gujarat , said that the rise could be attributed to manifestation of psychological issues during the lockdown.

Rise in domestic violence

The couples and families stayed together for a long time. In several cases, the trigger was petty issues like food not cooked as per taste or lack of hygiene practices,” Jashvant Prajapati , COO, EMRI Gujarat said.

“In Chandkheda, a woman was locked inside her house by her husband daily so that she does not step out of the house. She was also physically assaulted. In this case, the neighbours called up the helpline. Inquiry revealed that the husband was not happy with the quality of her domestic work. The matter escalated to the extent that cops had to intervene and send the woman to her parents’ home in Valsad even during lockdown,” said Falguni Patel , project coordinator for Abhayam 181in Ahmedabad.

Patel said that living inside four walls for a prolonged period brought to fore small issues which were hitherto ignored by the couples. In some cases, extramarital affairs came to fore and became a bone of contention. “In most cases, we salvaged the situation by counselling couples. In some instances, help of police was sought while in serious cases, several women were sent to observation homes and one-stop centres as it was not possible to stay with their families,” Patel said.

Dr Ramashankar Yadav , a city-based psychiatrist who had volunteered for psychiatric helpline, said lockdown affected the families in different ways and women and children often bore the brunt of the frustration or anxiety.

The writer explained her decision to come out as a survivor who was subjected to violence and abuse in her 20s, saying ""I'm mentioning these things now not in an attempt to garner sympathy, but out of solidarity with the huge numbers of women who have histories like mine, who've been slurred as bigots for having concerns around single-sex spaces"".Last week, the 54-year-old writer drew outrage on Twitter when she criticised an opinion piece that used the phrase ""people who menstruate"" and posited that discussion of gender identity invalidates biological sex.In her tweets, Rowling had said if sex isn't real, there's no same-sex attraction.""If sex isn''t real, the lived reality of women globally is erased. I know and love trans people, but erasing the concept of sex removes the ability of many to meaningfully discuss their lives. It isn''t hate to speak the truth,"" she wrote.""The idea that women like me, who've been empathetic to trans people for decades, feeling kinship because they''re vulnerable in the same way as women — ie, to male violence — 'hate' trans people because they think sex is real and has lived consequences — is a nonsense,"" she further said.Her tweets drew criticism from the LGBTQ community, ""Harry Potter"" star Daniel Radcliffe and others who were upset with her comments on social media, with many fans expressing disappointment that the author had tarnished their love for her books.On her official website, the British author expounded on her views on Wednesday what she meant by her initial tweets regarding sex and gender of women, and how identifying sex as a real thing is important.She recalled that when she read about the theory of gender identity in her youth she felt ""mentally sexless"", adding if she had been born 30 years later she too ""might have tried to transition"".""The allure of escaping womanhood would have been huge. I struggled with severe OCD as a teenager. If I''d found community and sympathy online that I couldn't find in my immediate environment, I believe I could have been persuaded to turn myself into the son my father had openly said he''d have preferred,"" the writer said.Rowling said if someone could read her mind, they would understand that when she reads about a trans woman dying at the hands of a violent man, she stands in ""solidarity and kinship"" with them.""I have a visceral sense of the terror in which those trans women will have spent their last seconds on earth, because I too have known moments of blind fear when I realised that the only thing keeping me alive was the shaky self-restraint of my attacker.""She said while she believes trans people need and deserve protection, she doesn't want to make natal girls and women ""less safe"".Accusing her critics of ""groupthink"" and ""relentless attacks"", the writer said, ""When you throw open the doors of bathrooms and changing rooms to any man who believes or feels he's a woman – and, as I've said, gender confirmation certificates may now be granted without any need for surgery or hormones – then you open the door to any and all men who wish to come inside. That is the simple truth.""In a reference to an unnamed poll, Rowling claimed that those who did not support preserving single-sex spaces were ""only those privileged or lucky enough never to have come up against male violence or sexual assault, and who''ve never troubled to educate themselves on how prevalent it is"".After receiving the backlash for her remarks she was ""in a very dark place inside my head, as memories of a serious sexual assault I suffered in my twenties recurred on a loop"".""That assault happened at a time and in a space where I was vulnerable, and a man capitalised on an opportunity. I couldn't shut out those memories and I was finding it hard to contain my anger and disappointment about the way I believe my government is playing fast and loose with women and girls'' safety.""Rowling said she had initially been moved to share her thoughts after reading about proposed ""gender confirmation certificates"" in Scotland, which will allow trans people to change sex on their birth certificates based on how they identify, not medical and psychiatric reports.""I've read all the arguments about femaleness not residing in the sexed body, and the assertions that biological womens don''t have common experiences, and I find them, too, deeply misogynistic and regressive.""It's also clear that one of the objectives of denying the importance of sex is to erode what some seem to see as the cruelly segregationist idea of women having their own biological realities or – just as threatening – unifying realities that make them a cohesive political class. The hundreds of emails I've received in the last few days prove this erosion concerns many others just as much. It isn't enough for women to be trans allies. Women must accept and admit that there is no material difference between trans women and themselves,"" she said."

Author J.K. Rowling defended her right to speak about trans issues without fear of abuse in an intensely personal essay in which she explained the complex reasons for her interest in the subject, revealing painful details from her past.The Harry Potter creator has long been a target of criticism by trans activists who have taken issue with some of her social media posts. At times, the criticism has taken the form of abusive language and threats of violence.""I know it's time to explain myself on an issue surrounded by toxicity,"" she wrote at the start of her essay, published on her website on Wednesday. She said she had no desire to add to that toxicity.In the latest of several controversies, a post by Rowling in which she criticised the use of the phrase ""people who menstruate"" drew negative responses, including from Daniel Radcliffe , who played Potter in a series of films.Rowling, 54, explained in detail her research and beliefs on trans issues, and the concerns she has about how women's rights and some young people's lives were being impacted by some forms of trans activism.Some of the reasons for her interest were professional, but some were rooted in personal experience.""I've wondered whether, if I'd been born 30 years later, I too might have tried to transition,"" she wrote. ""The allure of escaping womanhood would have been huge.""She said that as a teenager she had struggled with severe Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and that she now believes that had she found community and sympathy online, she could have been persuaded to turn herself into the boy her father said he would have preferred.Rowling also revealed that she was a survivor of domestic abuse and sexual assault, and that the trauma of those experiences informed some of her beliefs and feelings about women's rights, and her fears that they were being eroded.""The scars left by violence and sexual assault don't disappear, no matter how loved you are, and no matter how much money you've made,"" she said, offering solidarity and kinship to trans women who had died at the hands of violent men.""I have a visceral sense of the terror in which those trans women will have spent their last seconds on earth, because I too have known moments of blind fear when I realised that the only thing keeping me alive was the shaky self-restraint of my attacker.""""I REFUSE TO BOW DOWN""Rowling said that she believed most trans people not only posed zero threat to others but were vulnerable, and that they deserved protection.At the same time, she said, she did not want girls and women to be less safe, and she gave some examples of where she thought demands by trans people were dangerous to women.""When you throw open the doors of bathrooms and changing rooms to any man who believes or feels he's a woman ... then you open the door to any and all men who wish to come inside.""Describing some of the abuse she had received -- including being told she was ""literally killing people with your hate"" and being compared with Voldemort, the villain of the Potter series, Rowling said many women were terrified by trans activists.""I refuse to bow down to a movement that I believe is doing demonstrable harm in seeking to erode 'woman' as a political and biological class and offering cover to predators like few before it,"" she said.Addressing the specific issue of the use of phrases like ""people who menstruate"" as a way of including trans women, Rowling said such language was demeaning to many women.""I understand why trans activists consider this language to be appropriate and kind, but for those of us who've had degrading slurs spat at us by violent men, it's not neutral, it's hostile and alienating.""Rowling said she had not written the essay in the hope that anyone would get out a violin for her, and that she considered herself extraordinarily fortunate.""I've only mentioned my past because, like every other human being on this planet, I have a complex back-story, which shapes my fears, my interests and my opinions. I never forget that inner complexity when I'm creating a fictional character and I certainly never forget it when it comes to trans people.""All I'm asking - all I want - is for similar empathy, similar understanding, to be extended to the many millions of women whose sole crime is wanting their concerns to be heard without receiving threats and abuse."""

SINDRI: After securing bail in more than half a dozen cases of extortion and murderous attacks, BJP’s Baghmara MLA Dhullu Mahto’s dream of coming out of jail suffered a setback on Wednesday when the court of additional district and sessions court III-cum-special court for offenses against women of Dhanbad rejected his bail plea in a case related to a sexual assault.

With the plea rejected, the legislator, behind bars since May 11 after he surrendered before the court in a separate case, will vote for the Rajya Sabha elections from judicial custody..

Pleading for Mahto, his advocates S N Mukherjee, Radheshyam Goswami and N K Savita said he has been implicated in a false case on behest of his political rivals and that the complainant (a female BJP functionary) in 2018 had accused another person of sexually assaulting her. “Later, when she was exposed by the police, she accused Mahto of supporting that person and lodged a case against him,” they told the court.

Opposing the bail plea, public prosecutor B D Pandey informed the court that there were as many as 35 cases of severe nature lodged against Mahto.

A former BJP office bearer of Katras had accused the MLA of sexually assaulting her at a guesthouse in November 2015. When the police did not file a case against the MLA allegedly under political pressure, the complainant moved the high court. On the HC’s directive, the police lodged a case against on October 4 last year.

MADURAI: The Madurai district police have arrested a trustee and a supervisor of a children’s home near M Chatrapatti village in Madurai district on the charge of sexually assaulting an 11-year-old girl in the home.

The accused were identified as M Berlin Jose, 54, founder and secretary of Russ Foundation, which runs the home, and supervisor of the home V John Prabakar, 63. The foundation, headquartered in Ellis Nagar in Madurai city, was started in 1992 and focussed on health, HIV/AIDS, education, life skills and vocational training, police sources said.

The duo was arrested under Sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, 2012, including Section 6 (aggravated sexual assault). The home, which was functioning at Thondamapatti village, had 18 children, including some who were HIV positive.

Some of the children had parents who were HIV positive. Neither the victim child nor her parents were HIV infected. Of the 11 boys, three were HIV positive and of the seven girls four were HIV affected, sources from the district child protection unit said.

The incident came to light when the child was admitted to the government Rajaji hospital, where doctors found that she had undergone sexual assault. Earlier, the girl’s mother was called by the home authorities and asked to take the child to hospital as she had fallen ill. She was admitted to the hospital on October 15. There is also suspicion that the girl was given sedatives as she was very tired initially, the sources said.

On being alerted, the district children protection unit led by child protection officer Ganesan and child welfare committee chairman M Vijayasaravanan and committee member B Pandiarajan conducted inquiries with parents, trust authorities and children.

Sources said that when the issue was brought to the knowledge of Madurai collector T G Vijay, he instructed them to close down the home. The children have been rescued and the home will be sealed on Thursday, the sources said.

The alleged assault took place at Gaddiannaram market when the inspector was trying to clear out farmers who were gathering to sell their produce. The market had been closed since Tuesday afternoon after reports of violation of social distancing and other norms put in place by the government.

However, a significant number of farmers are still said to have reached the market on Tuesday night following which the police had to direct them to leave the place. Upon hearing this, a worker from BJP's Nagarkurnool cadre, Sudhakar Rao, approached the market to confront the police. He is said to have been pushed and verbally abused by the inspector.

""On police request, farmers with their vehicles initially left the market...but it was Sudhakar Rao who escorted them back during curfew hours, knowing full well that the market was close,"" Janaki Reddy, the inspector in question told TOI. Meanwhile, a case has been booked against Sudhakar for assault on a public servant and other charges.

NEW DELHI: Congress on Tuesday said the nomination of former Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi to Rajya Sabha constitutes a serious assault on the basic structure of the Constitution, alleging it would add to the perception that judiciary is being influenced by the government.

AICC spokesman Abhishek Singhvi said, “Congress finds the nomination of a retired CJI to the RS as one of the most serious, unprecedented and unpardonable assaults on the basic structure of the Constitution, which subsumes independence of judiciary as held by the Supreme Court judgements.”

Anand Sharma, deputy leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha, said, “Justice Gogoi's nomination is a reward for compromising the independence of the judiciary and delaying hearing of urgent Constitutional matters to appease the government.”

“By his conduct and actions, he eroded people's faith in the justice system. The present judges have a duty to undo the damage and restore the dignity of judiciary and people's trust,” he added.

The strong words from Congress came amid widespread criticism of Gogoi’s nomination to the RS by the opposition and former judges.

Singhvi said Prime Minister Narendra Modi could have followed the advice of late BJP leader Arun Jaitley who had said that possibility of post-retirement benefits influenced judgements delivered by judges.

The spokesman, who is also a supreme court lawyer, said Gogoi’s appointment will compound the perception that “judiciary in recent years has not been able to stand up with its usual vigour and fearlessness against the executive and legislative onslaught”.

AICC spokesman Randeep Surjewala quoted former SC judge Madan Lokur to ask, “Has the last bastion fallen?”

At the same time, Congress sought to rebuff the “propaganda by BJP” that Congress governments too had nominated former CJIs to the upper House.

Singhvi said Justice Ranganath Mishra was appointed to RS six years after his retirement while M Hidayatullah was appointed as chairman of the Rajya Sabha and vice president nine years after his retirement as Chief Justice of India.

“The dirty tricks department of the ruling party gives completely inapplicable and misleading examples whose only objective is to mislead you,” he said.

RTI activist Yashwant Shinde

MUMBAI: An RTI activist has lodged a complaint with Mumbai police commissioner seeking immediate registration of an FIR against DCP Abhinash Kumar for allegedly assaulting him without provocation.

Mumbai-based RTI activist Yashwant Shinde was admitted to KEM Hospital six days ago for internal injuries. He was discharged three days later on December 30. Shinde has given a two-day deadline for registration of his FIR or he would approach the Maharashtra State Police Complaint Authority.

Shinde had filed an appeal with Kumar regarding an “unsatisfactory” reply he got from Worli and Byculla police over Right to Information (RTI) Act queries. In December, Shinde had sought details under RTI on Worli police’s seizure of Rs 4 crore cash from a car during the state assembly elections in October.

“I had sought information regarding the seizure of cash as well as a job racket registered at Agripada police where BMC jobs were given on the basis of fake documents. In both cases, Mumbai police gave me evasive replies. Hence, I filed an appeal before DCP Kumar who was to hear me on December 27,” said Shinde.

Shinde had taken along a friend, Jitendra Kataria, to Kumar’s office.

Shinde alleged Kumar was aggressive and within minutes the discussion turned ugly. “I was polite to him and was listening sincerely but Kumar was rude and aggressive. All of a sudden, he got furious and jumped on his table and then pounced on me and began to hit me ruthlessly.” Shinde said when he tried to run, Kumar called his colleagues who pulled him back in the cabin. “They caught me and helped Kumar beat me till I fell unconscious.”

A bleeding Shinde was handed over to Byculla police where cops allegedly told him there was no point in complaining against Kumar, while apologising on his behalf, and advised him to say he fell off a chair. “A few policemen visited me in hospital and tried to convince me to change my mind about filing a complaint.”

Denying the allegation, Kumar said, “Nothing of this sort happened. He got injured after falling off a chair. The complaint is an afterthought as he is in the habit of being rude and of misbehaving. Four diary entries have been made against him for misbehaving with senior policemen. Secondly, the information he had sought under RTI was not relevant to him.”

Gajanan Ruia said around 50 security personnel were around Ruia House

MUMBAI: The maximum sentence businessmen Surinder (69) and Sanjay Ruia (68) faced, in a long-standing dispute with their nephew Gajanan over Ruia House, was seven years. Considering their age some leniency could be shown, said the court. It convicted them under IPC sections 452 (house trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint) and 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons).

“The sentence will also extend satisfaction to the victims of crime that law has prevailed,” the judge said.

“The mala fide practice of engaging goons to resolve a property dispute by force or terror appears to be alive through the conduct of the accused persons,” the court said.

Gajanan, who had registered a case with D N Nagar police on April 25, 1997, submitted that the families had cases pending in court. He said Surinder and Sanjay were his “cousin uncles” and occupied one portion of the bungalow, while he lived in another portion with his father, brother and their families. Gajanan alleged that since April 2, 1997, the accused had hired and kept about 50 security personnel around the house. His brother claimed that he had seen Capt Swaran Salaria, also a BJP politician, enter the house with a gun on April 3, 1997.

Gajanan said while having dinner around 9.15pm on April 24, 1997, he heard some sounds. On checking, he and his brother reportedly found that Salaria and around 20 security guards were smashing the hall’s doors. He alleged that Sanjay and Surendra were also present.

Gajanan said on spotting him, Salaria and his men began assaulting him with their fists and a baton at the behest of his uncles. He said the accused then entered his house via his office and assaulted his brother.

Gajanan said when he freed himself, the accused pushed him and left, but not before breaking chairs and tables in his office.

He alleged that Sanjay had threatened him, saying it was the “first lesson”.

After the gang left, Gajanan approached police, who took him to hospital.

On September 13, 2002, police submitted the chargesheet. Three years later, on August 22, 2005, the court framed charges against the accused, but they pleaded not guilty. While Surinder and Sanjay claimed that a false case had been filed to harass them and their families, Salaria submitted that he had been falsely implicated to damage his reputation and future. Seven witnesses, including Gajanan, his brother, police, a panch witness and a doctor who treated the victims for injuries, deposed.

Refuting the defence submissions, the court held that there was no reason for an independent witnesses-panch, police and doctor to depose falsely against the accused after two decades of the incident.

“Ultimately, evidence of all witnesses with prompt lodging of FIR and medical examination of the injured furnishes an assurance about the occurrence of the incident. There appears no justified reason to disbelieve or reject their versions,” the court said.

LUCKNOW: Two policemen were brutally assaulted and bundled out of a quarantine centre in Deoria late Saturday after they responded to an SOS call from inmates, in what was the 20th attack on cops in UP since lockdown was clamped, leaving 100 of them critically injured in a 68-day span.

The situation was brought under control after injured constables dialled police control room for reinforcements and the accused gram pradhan and his five goons were brought to book. The incident occurred at Pahadpur Purani Primary School in Khampar area of Deoria district, when the cops were enquiring about problems faced by inmates.

SHO Khampar, Sudesh Sharma, said, he dispatched two constables, Rajesh Kumar and Satendra Kumar, to a quarantine centre after a call on UP 112. “When they were talking to inmates, an altercation ensued with the gram pradhan, who was joined by five aides. They thrashed the cops and brutally dragged them out of the quarantine centre. We immediately dispatched a team to control the situation,” said Sharma.

The pradhan and his aides have been booked for attempt to murder, causing hurt to public servant on duty and Epidemic Act.

The complainant Raju Nath, an IIM Lucknow graduate, claimed that he was stopped by the police near Vidyasagar Hospital and brought to book for not wearing a helmet .

But the Parnasree police claimed that when he had been placed under arrest, he had allegedly assaulted the Parnasree police.

Nath said that he had gone out with his wife to buy medicines for his daughter when the incident happened. The couple staying at Rabindra Nagar had moved the commissioner’s office and Kolkata Police to lodge a complaint against the police. Nath produced a medical report from SSKM, which mentioned “traumatic perforation” in his left ear along with fever as evidence that he had been hit on his head and ears by a sub-inspector.

“I have provided a video evidence. I am a middle class man and an educated person. It hurts when I see that I am being portrayed as the accused even when I am not hearing well in the past two days due to my injuries,” Nath told TOI.

578,Assault,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-declares-sexual-assault-never-never-happened/articleshow/75499309.cms,"WASHINGTON: Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Friday emphatically denied allegations from a former Senate staffer that he sexually assaulted her in the early 1990s, declaring flatly that ``this never happened.''

Biden's first public remarks on the accusation by a former employee, Tara Reade , come at a critical moment for the presumptive Democratic nominee as he tries to relieve mounting pressure after weeks of leaving denials to his campaign.

``I'm saying unequivocally, it never, never happened,'' the former vice president and senator said in an interview on MSNBC's ``Morning Joe.''

Biden said he will ask the National Archives to determine whether there is any record of a complaint being filed, as Reade has claimed. Later Friday, Biden asked the secretary of the Senate via letter to assist in the search, though he told MSNBC that the Archives was the only possible place a complaint would be. He said his Senate papers held under seal at the University of Delaware do not contain personnel records.

``The former staffer has said she filed a complaint back in 1993,'' Biden said. ``But she does not have a record of this alleged complaint.''

Reade did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.

The Archives deflected inquiries to Capitol Hill, saying any complaint ``would have remained under the control of the Senate.'' A spokeswoman for the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights said confidentiality rules bar the office from commenting on ``whether specific claims may or may not have been filed.''

Biden, in his TV interview, said ""there are so many inconsistencies'' in Reade's various accounts. But he said he does not ``question her motive.'' He said over his five decades in public life, none of his employees was asked to sign a nondisclosure agreement.

Republicans worried about President Donald Trump 's increasingly precarious political standing are casting Democrats as only defending women who allege wrongdoing against conservatives. They're digging in despite the possibility of renewed attention on the multiple sexual assault allegations lodged against Trump, who denies the accusations.

In light of his own situation, Trump is stepping delicately around the Biden controversy.

``He's going to have to make his own decision,'' Trump said in a podcast interview Friday with Dan Bongino. ``I'm not going to be telling him what to do.'' The president added that it would be a ``great thing'' if Biden had records that could ``dispose'' of Reade's allegation.

Democrats, meanwhile, are in an awkward position of validating women who come forward with their stories while defending their standard-bearer ahead of an expected competitive election.

Former Democratic Party chairwoman Donna Brazile said before Biden's interview that his silence was ``damaging,'' but afterward said he handled the matter well.

``He responded, he denied it, and there's nothing more to be added,'' Brazile said, before alluding to Reade's repeated public statements. ``If you add to the story the way Tara Reade has, it only brings more confusion.''

Karen Finney, who worked for Hillary Clinton in 2016, described Biden as ``very clear and consistent'' and ``sincere,'' but said it should have come ``a little bit sooner.''

The November presidential election will be the first of the (hash)MeToo era, during which numerous women have publicly disclosed experiences of sexual harassment and assault.

Women are a core constituency for Democrats. Biden wrote the Violence Against Women Act as a senator but came under criticism for his handling of Anita Hill's 1991 Senate testimony against now-Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.

Just before he launched his 2020 campaign, Biden apologized after several women said he'd made them uncomfortable with unwanted touching.

He has pledged to pick a woman as a running mate, and the Reade allegation has left those thought to be in contention in a tough spot.

Some of them have echoed talking points the Biden campaign issued to surrogates last week that were obtained by The Associated Press. The campaign pointed to investigations by The New York Times, The Washington Post and the AP that found no other allegation of sexual assault against Biden and no pattern of sexual misconduct.

Some Democratic donors say the matter hasn't come up in recent strategy calls. Others worry it'll be used against Biden, much as Republicans harped in 2016 on Clinton's private email server and Clinton Foundation activities.

``We know they're going to try elements of the same playbook,'' said Finney, pointing to calls for Biden to release his Senate papers.

Other Democratic operatives expressed concern the allegation complicates a central Biden pitch: that he provides a moral counter to Trump.

``I think we have to apply a consistent standard for how we treat allegations of sexual assault, and also be clear-eyed about how Donald Trump will use these allegations,'' said Claire Sandberg, who worked as Bernie Sanders ' organizing director.

Republicans have seized on the prospects of scouring Biden's records, showing aggressiveness that was harder for them four years ago while Trump was having to deny varying levels of sexual assault and harassment.

Trump joined fellow Republicans in arguing Friday that Democrats aren't being consistent, pointing again to the aggressive questioning of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh when he faced a sexual assault allegation.

Biden pushed back on those notions Friday during the interview and, later, during a virtual campaign fundraiser. He told 2,200 donors, many of them veterans of the Obama administration, that his position has always been to take women's claims seriously. ``It isn't enough just to simply take my word for it and dismiss it out of hand,'' he said, because ``that sort of approach is how the culture of abuse has been allowed to fester for so long.''

Trump's reelection campaign quickly released a digital ad featuring prominent Democrats, including Biden and Clinton, saying, ``Believe women'' and similar sentiments.

``Ladies and gentleman, we just can't have it both ways,'' White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said. ``We cannot decide which women were included in 'believe all women.'''

Hill, long critical of how Biden handled her accusations against Thomas, issued a statement highlighting the complexities across the political spectrum. Noting Reade, Kavanaugh's accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, and Trump's many accusers, Hill called for an investigation of ``outstanding claims of sexual misconduct'' against Trump and Biden, warning that otherwise ``the public is left to figure out the truth on its own.'

PARIS: The former head of French ice skating Didier Gailhaguet has demanded 300,000 euros in compensation from the country's sports ministry for being forced to resign because of a sexual assault scandal , according to documents seen by AFP.

In the document Gailhaguet, 66, says he wants the 152,550 euros ($167,277) he says he would have received as salary had he remained until the end of his mandate, and 150,000 euros in damages.

He denounced pressure from sports minister Roxana Maracineanu , who insisted he resign from his position as head of the French Ice Sports Federation (FFSG), until he bowed to it in February and stepped down.

Gailhaguet left the federation, which he had led almost uninterrupted since 1998, after a series of former skaters, most notably Sarah Abitol in her book ""Un si long silence"", accused former skating coaches including Gilles Beyer of rape and sexual assault.

Beyer, the manager of the French national figure skating team, was removed following an investigation by the sports ministry in 2000 but under Gailhaguet, was allowed to continue coaching at club level.

Gailhaguet says he asked the sports ministry to launch a probe into Beyer's conduct in 1999 following allegations from a skater of ""ambiguous behaviour"", and says the ministry approved the courses Beyer organised with minors between 2000-2019.

Earlier this month Gailhaguet said he would not leave his position at the French Olympic Committee , saying he refused to be ""the fall guy for the administration's obvious malfunctions"".

He also said in the message that he was forced to resign to save French skating by the threat of withdrawal of recognition brandished by Maracineanu, which he described as ""an atomic weapon"".

590,Assault,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/biden-accuser-spoke-to-neighbor-of-alleged-assault-report/articleshow/75419777.cms,"WASHINGTON: An associate of a former Senate aide to Joe Biden says the woman told her about her allegations of sexual assault against Biden - now the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee in the 1990s.

The account, which was published Monday in Business Insider , comes a little over a month after Tara Reade first accused Biden of sexually assaulting her in the basement of a Capitol Hill office building when she worked in his office in the spring of 1993. Biden's campaign has denied the allegations.

In an interview with The Associated Press earlier this month, Reade said she had told at least four people about the incident, including her deceased mother and her brother, who has spoken publicly about the matter. The AP spoke with two individuals on the condition of anonymity; one said Reade told them about the alleged assault when it happened, while the other said Reade told them in 2007 or 2008 about experiencing sexual harassment from Biden while working in his Senate office.

Now Lynda LaCasse, who was Reade's neighbor in the 1990s, says Reade told her about the alleged assault around the time it happened. LaCasse said that when they were neighbors in 1995 or 1996, Reade told her ``about the senator that she had worked for and he put his hand up her skirt.''

``She felt like she was assaulted, and she really didn't feel there was anything she could do,'' LaCasse told Business Insider.

A second woman, Lorraine Sanchez, worked with Reade for California state Sen. Jack O'Connell from 1994 to 1996. Sanchez told Business Insider that Reade said ``she had been sexually harassed by her former boss while she was in DC'' and was fired for voicing her concerns.

The AP was unable to reach Sanchez or LaCasse. Reade did not respond to questions about why she did not mention the women in earlier interviews as people who could corroborate her story. She told The AP on Monday that she had been asked not to share the women's contact information with news organizations.

The Biden campaign declined to comment on the new interviews, pointing to an earlier statement from deputy campaign manager and communications director Kate Bedingfield. The statement said that while sexual assault claims should be ``diligently reviewed by an independent press,'' what Reade alleged ``absolutely did not happen.''

Reade said in past interviews that Biden pushed her against a wall in the basement of a Capitol Hill office building, groped her and penetrated her with his fingers. She said after telling her supervisors in Biden's office that she had been sexually harassed by the then-senator, her concerns weren't taken seriously and she was eventually told to find another job.

Two of those staffers have said in interviews that they didn't recall Reade or any such incident. The third issued an on-the-record statement denying Reade's claim.

Late last week, the Intercept unearthed a 1993 video clip that shows a woman Reade says was her mother calling into CNN's ``Larry King Live.'' In the clip, an unnamed woman from San Luis Obispo, Calif., tells King that her daughter just left Washington , ``after working for a prominent senator, and could not get through with her problems at all, and the only thing she could have done was go to the press, and she chose not to do it out of respect for him.''

Last spring, eight women, including Reade, came forward with allegations that Biden made them feel uncomfortable with inappropriate displays of affection. Biden acknowledged the complaints and promised to be ``more mindful about respecting personal space in the future.``

The AP spoke with Reade about those complaints in April 2019. During that interview, Reade alleged that Biden rubbed her shoulders and neck and played with her hair, and that she was asked by another aide in Biden's Senate office to dress more conservatively and told ``don't be so sexy.'' The AP declined to publish details of the interview at the time because reporters were unable to corroborate her allegations, and aspects of her story contradicted other reporting.

Reade came forward in March with the additional allegation of assault during a podcast interview with Katie Halper .

The Republican National Committee and other allies of President Donald Trump have been highlighting Reade's allegations against Biden, though the president has not raised them himself. Trump has faced numerous allegations of sexual assault, allegations he denies. He also apologized during the 2016 campaign for comments he made during an interview with Access Hollywood in which he bragged about using his celebrity to assault women.

Reade, a longtime Democrat who supported both Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders in the primary, said she won't be voting for Trump or Biden in November. While Trump has faced allegations of sexual assault that are more severe and numerous, Reade said she felt either was a similarly bad option.

``It's sad statement about our own culture that we are having to choose between two men that have allegations of sexual assault and sexual harassment and a history of misogyny,'' Reade said.

MUMBAI: Even as the state denied one of two lockdown deaths here was due to police excesses , Bombay high court on Friday directed it to file a detailed reply on an advocate’s complaint that he and his family were allegedly assaulted by police.

“If an advocate is going to suffer this way, what about poor citizens? What you think must have happened all over the state?” advocate Fridause Irani asked a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Nijamoodin Jamadar. Irani filed a PIL stating that his wife and two lawyer sons were assaulted by police in civies on April 16 outside their Goregaon (W) home. On June 3, HC also sought the state’s reply on two Mumbai deaths noted in a report by Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative .

The first case was of Raju Devendra, whose family alleged was assaulted by 7-8 police from Juhu police station on March 30. The latter claimed Raju was lynched when he went to commit a robbery and an FIR was lodged against eight unknown persons. The reply by ACP (Bandra division) said that the investigations were transferred to him on April 13, but as the incident occurred in Nehru Nagar slums, a red zone, he could not call witnesses.

The second was of Sagir Khan, who on April 18 was stopped at Dongri while pushing a handcart to deliver a refrigerator in Null Bazaar. JJ Marg police station said CCTV footage showed he was not stopped by them. He collapsed at home and was declared dead before admission to JJ Hospital.

There were no injury marks.

Irani said his PIL was to draw HC attention to “gravity of the situation in the state the people have faced in the past three months”.

“State has to explain why such incidents have happened... Why such indignity?” he said, adding that videos of such incidents are circulated worldwide. He said he got “more than 100 calls for help” on complaints of police harassment.

Government pleader Poornima Kantharia sought time to reply, so the judges directed a detailed reply before a fortnight.

Greater Noida: A Chinese woman , working with a smartphone manufacturer in Greater Noida, was allegedly assaulted by an elderly resident in ATS Green Paradiso housing society on Monday morning. His grouse — she was feeding a stray dog inside the premises. The man, who is in his sixties, has been booked, police said.

The alleged assault took place around 6.30am when Carol and the elderly man, both residents of the same society, were walking their respective pet dogs inside the premises. Seeing Carol feeding a stray dog inside the society, the man raised an objection. But soon an argument broke out between them, and the man hit her with his walking stick, according to the police complaint.

Omveer Singh, the RWA president of the society, said that the woman had been asked many a time not to feed the stray dog inside the society “as it often becomes aggressive seeing their pets”. “In the morning, the senior citizen saw Carol feeding the stray inside the society and as he went close to her, the dog started barking at his pet, which triggered an argument between the duo, leading to the assault,” he said.

However, Singh has condemned the assault. “It is totally unacceptable for anyone to take law in their hands, the man should have complained formally about the issue and we would have dealt with it,” he said.

Police said an FIR was lodged against the resident under Section 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of the IPC, following the complaint. “The woman was taken for a medical examination which confirmed assault. She suffered bruises in her left hand and thighs. Action will soon be taken against the offender,” Rajesh Kumar Singh, DCP (Zone III), said.

CUTTACK: The two-year old case involving the assault allegation by two sisters inside the Nayapalli police station (Bhubaneswar) took a new turn with the Orissa high court issuing a stay order on the Odisha Human Rights Commission (OHRC)'s order recommending a compensation of Rs 50,000 for each victim. Justice Biswanath Rath issued the interim stay order on Thursday on a petition that challenged the OHRC order issued on February 26, 2020. Sub-inspector Sasmita Dhal, one of three accused officers in the case, filed the petition.

Justice Rath will hear the matter after eight weeks along with a counter affidavit, if any, from the state government and OHRC. He clarified that the interim stay order shall remain in operation till the final outcome of the petition.

The alleged torture case had surfaced when a video and photographs of the incident went viral after the girls uploaded them on social media channels following the incident in May 2018. They had filed a petition before OHRC, which had sought an inquiry into the allegations. The case has been pending since then.

On February 26, 2020, official inquiries revealed gross misconduct, dereliction of duty and misuse of official position by the inspector in-charge and two SIs of the Nayapalli police station in the case. The inquiries confirmed that the two sisters were brought to the police station and then assaulted, harassed, abused and forwarded to court. It also confirmed that the two were charged under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code arbitrarily and in a revengeful manner. This apart, it submitted that the departmental and criminal proceedings had been initiated against IIC Sangram Keshari Patnaik and the two SIs - Sasmita Dhal and Minati Nayak .

However, the human rights body in its February 26 order said, ""Having regard to the facts and circumstances of this case, the commission considers it to be appropriate to award compensation of Rs 50,000 to each of the two victims. Accordingly, the commission recommends the payment of Rs 50,000 to them."" ""The admissions from the side of the state clearly establish that human rights of the two victims were violated by the three public servants while discharging their duties. The victims' rights to life and dignity were violated. Therefore, the state is vicariously responsible for the acts of its public servants,"" the OHRC had further observed.

Toronto: Canada's worst mass shooting erupted from an argument between the gunman and his girlfriend, who survived the attack, police confirmed Friday.

Royal Canadian Mounted Police Supt. Darren Campbell said the weekend shooting rampage started with an assault by the suspect on his girlfriend and ended with 22 people dead in communities across central and northern Nova Scotia .

""She did manage to escape. That could well have been the catalyst of events,"" Campbell said.

Campbell also said they are not discounting that the suspect planned some of the murders.

He said the girlfriend hid overnight in the woods from the suspect, who has been identified as 51-year-old Gabriel Wortman.

Police have said Wortman acted alone in the shooting spree that killed 22 people in several rural communities.

Campbell said they found 13 deceased victims in the rural community of Portapique, where the suspect lived part time.

He said when police arrived, they discovered a man shot. The man reported he was driving when someone in what looked like a police car shot him. He survived and was transported to hospital.

They were several homes on fire, including the suspect's, when police arrived in the community. Campbell said the suspect had a pistol and several long barreled guns. They found several dead in and outside homes.

Campbell said at about 6:30 a.m., Wortman's girlfriend emerged from hiding in the woods, called 911 and gave police detailed information about the suspect including that he was driving a mock police car and was in police uniform.

More than an hour later, police started receiving 911 calls more than 35 miles away. Campbell said the suspect killed three people he knew and set the house on fire.

He also shot a woman on the street and pulled cars over and shot and killed people, Campbell said. He later shot and injured a male police officer in his car.

The officer managed to escape and survived. Campbell then said there was a collision between a female officer's police car and the gunman's mock police car.

He shot and killed the officer. Campbell said he then killed a witness who arrived on the scene.

He then drove to a house and killed a woman he knew before removing his police uniform and stealing her car. He then drove to get gas and was shot by a police officer who happened to be at the gas station refueling.

The suspect was shot to death at 11:26 on Sunday morning, about 13 hours after the attacks began.

Police have said Wortman carried out much of the attack disguised as a police officer in a vehicle marked to seem like a patrol car.

Campbell said he had a few cars that police believe were former police vehicles. His home was destroyed by fire.

John Hudson, who had known Wortman for about 18 years, said Wortman was sometimes openly controlling and jealous of his long-time girlfriend.

“I didn't see him hitting her or anything like that,” Hudson said.

“But I know they fought.” Hudson recalled a bonfire party about 10 years ago when an argument between the two left the woman locked out of their home in rural Portapique.

“I was with her, trying to get her stuff out of there,” Hudson said.

“People had been drinking ... and it was a crazy night ... and he didn't want her to leave, but he wouldn't let her in the house.”

Wortman, who owned a denture practice in the city of Dartmouth, near Halifax, lived part time in Portapique, according to residents. His Atlantic Denture Clinic had been closed the past month because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Mass shootings are relatively rare in Canada.

The country overhauled its gun control laws after Marc Lepine shot 14 women and himself to death at Montreal 's Ecole Polytechnique college in 1989.

Before the weekend rampage, that had been Canada's worst mass shooting.

Two years ago Thursday, a man drove a van along a busy Toronto sidewalk and killed 10 people and injured 16.

The suspect, who is awaiting trial, said he carried out the attack in retribution for years of sexual rejection and ridicule by women.

AJMER: A woman doctor filed a complaint at Civil Lines police station here on Thursday accusing a woman IAS officer posted as SDM, of assaulting and threatening her. The SDM however refuted the charges. Police have initiated investigation before registering an FIR in the matter.

Medical officer Jyotsana Ranga has stated in her complaint that recently, at the CMHO office, there was a meeting addressed by SDM Artika Shukla. Shukla allegedly spoke against some resident doctors and others, while Dr Ranga was sitting with her mobile in her hand. Shukla thought that Ranga was shooting a video or recording something on the phone.

Shukla then allegedly misbehaved with and manhandled Ranga, trying to snatch her mobile. Dr Ranga has also alleged that when a large number of positive cases emerged in Mochi Mohalla, she asked that all suspects be sent to quarantine centre, but nodal officer SDM Shukla directed to home quarantine them instead.

Shukla however maintained that all allegations made against her are baseless. “At a time when 44 corona cases have been reported from Ajmer , it is extremely unfortunate that she is spreading baseless rumours, rather than working for the patients. No one manhandled her and no one said anything to her,” said Shukla. She said that the doctor was misbehaving hence was asked to leave. “As Covid in-charge of Ajmer, I had gone to the CMHO to plan contact tracing of patients and will continue to do so in future,” she said.

KOLKATA: Jadavpur University descended into chaos on Thursday after a section of students, belonging to some ultra-left unions, assaulted Union minister and BJP Asansol MP Babul Supriyo , who had gone to the campus to attend a programme organised by Bharatiya Janata Party student wing Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad.But the violent left-versus-right students’-union face-off on a varsity campus seemed headed for wider political ramifications after conversations between the state’s chief minister, its governor (also the university’s chancellor) and the university’s vice-chancellor indicated sharp differences on how to fight the latest crisis gripping one of Bengal’s premier educational institutions. Seniors in the Trinamool government called Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar’s decision — to drive down to JU hours after news of the violence broke — “a move without precedence in recent times”.Trinamool leaders present in Delhi along with CM Mamata Banerjee said she got a call from governor Dhankhar around 6.20pm, which she missed. But she then called back the governor and, after coming to know that he was headed for the JU campus, requested him not to go there because it was a students’ agitation to protest against a “Union minister attending an ABVP party function”.The Trinamool later issued a media statement, saying it was “most unfortunate and shocking” that the “hon’ble governor went there without taking the state government into confidence”. “He rang up the CM on his way. The CM requested him several times that the governor, being the constitutional head, did not need to go there at that moment. The CM requested him to give the state government some time to peacefully resolve the issue,” the statement said, adding: “But, instead of taking the government into confidence, the governor went there to help the BJP.”There was no response to the Trinamool statements from Raj Bhavan till late on Thursday night but a statement issued by the governor’s office earlier in the evening expressed concern at the “unlawful detention of a union minister” and termed the events on the JU campus “a very serious reflection on the law-and-order (situation) of the state and the conduct of law-enforcing agencies”.There were indications from the university that JU vice-chancellor Suranjan Das was “under pressure to resign” after the incident. “There were serious differences of opinion between the chancellor of the university (governor Dhankhar) and the V-C about calling in cops to tackle the situation and V-C Das, at one point of time, said he would rather resign than call in cops,” a senior state government minister told TOI. “But we have impressed on him that his first task is to restore normalcy to the campus,” the minister said, adding: “There is no need for the V-C to resign.”State education minister Partha Chatterjee, officials said, was in constant touch with Das, who was admitted to a hospital on Thursday evening with complaints of “headache, vertigo, palpitation and nausea”.Dhankhar was caught up in the protests at the university for nearly an hour, first because of the students’ agitation on the campus and then because of the violent protests by ABVP members outside. Police finally managed to escort the governor out around 8pm, after which the Rapid Action Force was deployed to control the situation. The governor later called Union home minister Amit Shah and briefed him on the situation.Thursday’s fiasco followed strident protests on the campus over the years, including display of black flags and “go-back” chants against former chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and serving education minister Chatterjee. Bengal CM Banerjee, too, has been at the receiving end of ugly protests at Presidency University that forced authorities to hold the convocation elsewhere this January.The first sign of trouble on Thursday came around 2.30 p.m. when Babul stepped on the campus to attend a freshers’ welcome organised by the ABVP. The ultra-left Democratic Students’ Federation and the Forum for Arts Students waved black flags, screamed “go-back” slogans and blocked his path to the KP Basu Memorial Hall. Students’ Federation of India representatives said they backed the students’ demands but did not support the gherao.V-C Das offered to escort Babul to his office but the latter refused and insisted on attending the programme. The union minister suggested that the VC could have controlled the situation had he arrived earlier and called in the police, witnesses said, but Das told him he would rather resign than call cops on the campus. Once inside, Babul expressed apprehension over how he would return once the programme ended.His apprehensions proved true as students stepped up the agitation when he tried to leave around 5 p.m. They gharoed Babul and began jostling with him, causing him to fall on the ground. Some students pulled him by his hair and a security personnel’s magazine fell from the rifle in the melee.“The protesters were trying to disturb peace by instigating students and seminar organisers to create a stampede-like situation. I did not come here to do politics. But I am saddened by the behaviour of some of the university students and the way they have heckled me. They pulled my hair and pushed me. The VC was also manhandled by the students. The incident is absolutely deplorable,” Babul told mediapersons."

The police identified the accused as S Balraj, 43, of Mettupatti village in Thanjavur. Balraj was in charge of hiring workers for textile showrooms in the district.

The 14-year-old minor girl, a native of Thiruverumbur in Trichy district, moved to Valappakudi village in Thanjavur along with her family in 2018. In a few months, Balraj visited Valappakudi to hire workers. He noticed the girl and decided to marry her.

Though the girl opposed, he forced her into the marriage by convincing the poverty-stricken family. The marriage was conducted in a relative's house in Pudukkottai district in September 2019.

After the ‘indoor’ wedding, the couple stayed in a rented house in Pudukkottai district. Balraj had sexually assaulted the girl on a daily basis.

He again married her in a mass wedding ceremony organised under marriage assistance scheme as part of the late chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s birthday celebrations on March 22, 2020, in Thanjavur. Balraj decided to be part of the mass wedding for gold and utensils from the organisers. Following this, the two again moved to Balraj’s native in Mettupatti.

This apart, the man also forced the girl to lodge a rape attempt complaint against a few people from his native as he had issues with them. On refusing to do so, he threatened to kill her.

On Monday, the girl managed to escape from the house and lodged a complaint against Balraj with the Vallam town all-woman police with the help of her relatives.

Based on her compliant, the police registered a case and arrested him under various sections.

The police said he was booked on charges of sexual assault on the child repeatedly under the Pocso Act and Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006. He was remanded in judicial custody.

The spot near Park Circus where a woman was assaulted on Monday

KOLKATA: Incidents of misconduct by app-cab drivers, like the one that took place near Park Circus on Wednesday where a woman was allegedly abused, assaulted and shoved out of the vehicle, show that stringent measures taken by online cab aggregators are falling short of ensuring passenger safety.

“A driver’s unsafe behaviour, particularly towards women and elderly citizens, bothers us the most. This is why we are getting more and more stringent with time. A driver gets on board only after a series of checks and due diligence. Gender sensitization has become a round-the-year activity for us. Such misconducts are a miniscule percentage compared to our scale of operation, but it worries us the most,” said an Uber official.

The real-time ID-checking is a feature where a driver is periodically prompted by the system to share selfie with the online aggregator of cab services. This ensures that the driver behind the wheels matches the aggregator’s records. The system almost eliminates the scope of identity swapping. In some cases, the actions were on a real-time basis, explained an Ola official.

Ujjaini Bose, a regular app-cab user, for instance, once noticed the driver constantly checking his rear view mirror. At first, she thought he was being cautious with his driving, but then she discovered he was trying to click pictures of her. “I was angry. When I asked him what he was doing, he replied that he was checking his eyes. I deleted the photos from his phone and got off the cab. I lodged a complaint against him in the app and he was not allowed to drive anymore,” said Bose.

Drivers’ rating can some time be deceptive. Sreyoshi Roy Chowdhury, 26, was returning home recently when she had an unpleasant experience with a driver with highest possible rating. “I was returning home in an Uber late in the evening when I heard the driver talk to someone on the phone using abusive sexual language. It made me feel incredibly uncomfortable and unsafe. Fearing for my safety, I called a trusted family member and stayed with them on the phone until I reached my destination, constantly informing them about my whereabouts,” said Sreyoshi.

""I normally ignore those who rudely try to raise any issues about the feeding of animals. However, one of them actually hit me and I had to run towards the main gate of Millennium Tower to save myself from further assault . I also recorded this incident on my mobile phone and uploaded the same on YouTube as evidence,"" said Pradeep

The victim has lodged a non-cognizable complaint (NC) at Sanpada police station the same night.

""Despite being assaulted, I will continue feeding the local community dogs, as I have been doing so regularly. In fact, I and other animal lovers are not violating any rules or laws by doing it, since it is imprinted in our Constitution of India to show compassion for all living beings,"" the youth added

City activist Anarjit Chauhan, who is also a member of Harit Navi Mumbai group that helps animals said, ""There is a constant fear among animal lovers and feeders that their dogs or cats may be harmed by the 'haters'. In fact, during the ongoing Swachhata Mission (cleanliness drive), many local dogs actually went missing, like it happened last year. This is cruel and illegal, because community dogs, cats have as much right to live here as the humans do.""

Chauhan said, ""All the local feeders do take care to clean up the areas where they feed animals. Hence the others should not make an issue of this. Harit Navi Mumbai will take up the assault case at Millennium Tower to top authorities if such harassment continues.""

Police informed that Pradeep's assault case was registered under the IPC sections 503 and 56 in the NC. Further inquiry is on in the matter.

The 27-year-old soldier, associated with Unit 119 of the Assault Engineer Regiment of Indian Army , died in a mishap in Leh-Ladakh on May 12, an official release said.

As per the Bochare family’s wishes, the last rites on the soldier were performed at his ancestral field after the body was brought to the village from the Chikalthana airport in Aurangabad. The state police sounded the bugle and fired three rounds in the air before playing the national anthem as the family members and other village residents bid a tearful adieu to the soldier.

Gokul Popalghat, a resident of Devgaon-Rangari and family friend of the deceased, said Bochare had got married only around six months ago. “We had applied for selection in the Indian Army together, but Hrishikesh succeeded and joined the service in 2013. Hrishikesh was very cordial and helpful in nature. He made the ultimate sacrifice for the nation and everyone is proud of him,” he said.

Popalghat said the defence authorities cited a snow-fall induced landslide as the reason for Bochare’s death. “He was trapped under the debris and died of suffocation,” he said, referring to the telephonic conversation between the soldier’s family and the defence authorities.

“Even if we are all in grief, the village decided to bid a final adieu to our friend on a patriotic note. Hrishikesh will continue to inspire future generations in our village,” Sahedo Shelke, another villager said.

KOLKATA: The reverberations of the slap that landed on a doctor’s face reached far beyond CMRI hospital where the incident occurred on Thursday morning with senior doctors practising in government and private hospitals expressing fears that the consequence of the brazen attack shown on television could trigger more such attacks in future.“This is a dark day. Such assault on doctors could be as infectious as the coronavirus. Today, it has happened at CMRI. Tomorrow, it will happen in other hospitals. Every death is unfortunate. But how can a doctor be assaulted every time there is a death? If things go like this, doctors will be scared to operate on patients,” said SSKM Hospital hepatology head Abhijit Chowdhury, who termed the slapping incident a criminal offence.Some doctors said patient Rinki Bhattacharya could have developed pulmonary embolism after childbirth. In such a case, blood clot forms inside a vein and travel to the lung, causing cardiac arrest with high mortality rate. Others, though, felt only a post-mortem could determine the exact cause, something that Basab Mukherjee had himself suggested.“Even doctors with superb clinical skills can make mistakes. Mukherjee rightly suggested a post-mortem to determine the cause of death. The assault was absolutely uncalled for,” said gynaecologist Dibyendu Banerjee, president of Bengal Obstetrics and Gynaecological Society (BOGS).Members of BOGS that has demanded stringent action against the culprit while urging the authorities concerned to carry out a thorough investigation into the cause of the patient’s death, expressed shock that Mukherjee, known for his soft-skills, deep knowledge and polite behaviour, was at the receiving end of the assault.Condemning the incident, doctors said the authorities needed to act tough against the perpetrators to send a clear message that violence would not be tolerated in hospitals. “The slap on the face of this doctor is a slap on the face of the medical community. Sadly, cops were present during the assault. They remained spectators. People who saw the CCTV footage of the assault in front of uniformed men will believe they can get away with anything,” said ENT specialist Arjun Dasgupta of West Bengal Doctors’ Forum (WBDF).Doctors’ bodies cutting across political lines have threatened a stir if the administration did not punish the attacker. Associations like WBDF and Service Doctors’ Forum said they would wait for the police response before deciding on their next course of action. Doctors for Patients (DOPA) has asked the medical fraternity to brace up for protests.Thursday’s incident ended an eight-month lull that had followed a series of attacks on doctors and hospital vandalism. The government had last June adopted a slew of measures to prevent such assaults, mainly in government hospitals after the NRS Hospital incident in which junior doctors were assaulted by a mob.“We will not take this incident lightly and request our members and doctors of all other organisations to prepare for an agitation,” said a DOPA release."

AHMEDABAD: The new Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Hospital has made the news again, this time as security staff allegedly assaulted a woman and her son, who had come to the hospital for a heart.

The AMC, however, claimed that the mother and son had attacked staffers and security personnel who intervened. AMC officials said the matter reached the police station, but a ‘compromise’ was worked out there.

Jayshree Dave said, “On Wednesday, my son Sunny and I had gone to SVP Hospital to get his reports. After reaching the designated window, they were told to wait. We decided to go and consult the doctors in the meantime. After an hour when we returned, the staff again told us to wait.”

Dave further said when the wait grew too long, her son took out his mobile phone and started making a video. “He stated the fact that we were made to wait for more than two hours just to pick up a report. The hospital staffers then call the security guards, who arrived and started hitting him. When I intervened, the women security staffers started beating me,” said Dave.

She said that the security staffers took her son outside and when she got there, she found that they were beating him. “I immediately dialled 100 and the police reached the spot,” Dave said.

She said the hospital agreed to apologize in writing after which they did not file a complaint. Meanwhile, a statement from the hospital stated that the son was suffering from major adjustment disorder with depression and when they were told to wait for the MRI report, the mother and son attacked staffers. “They even attacked the security staff who intervened,” the statement said.

GURUGRAM: Police have written to Facebook , Instagram ’s parent company, for information related to a post on the photo-sharing website written by a 17-year-old girl last week in which she accused a male classmate of sexually assaulting her two years ago.

The boy jumped to death from the balcony of his 11th-floor flat that same evening. Police began a probe after the boy’s father filed a complaint that blamed the post and the online abuse for driving his son to suicide . The boy’s father also sought legal changes in teenagers’ use of social media.

Police said that they have sought details of the original post written by the girl, the account from which she had posted it, the comments made by other users on her post and the handles that shared her post.

The girl, who had spoken to TOI the day the boy’s father filed a police complaint, had said she had not tagged the boy in her original post but others had, which had led to trolls targeting him. The boy’s father has also approached the child rights commission for a case against the girl.

The girl, who was targeted by trolls after the boy committed suicide, had told TOI she stands by her post, which she said she wrote because she was “tired of keeping it inside me”.

“I deactivated my account because of the filth that I was being subjected to after his death. It’s sad he took this step. But, that doesn’t prove my story wrong,” she had told TOI.

The boy’s father had told TOI it was immense distress, shame, fear and unbearable anxieties caused by the post that drove his son to suicide. So far, no FIR has been registered. DCP (east) Chandar Mohan has formed a special investigation team (SIT) to investigate the case and take appropriate action. ACP (DLF) Karan Goyal is heading the four-member SIT comprising the Sector 53 SHO and two officers from cyber police station.

“We have written to Facebook and are waiting for a reply,” said Goyal, adding that boy’s friends had also written some posts after his suicide that are still in circulation.

Police will record statements of the boy’s parents and his friends as well as the girl. “Friends of the boy will be counselled to help them come out of the trauma,” said the officer, adding the girl’s allegations are serious need to be investigated.

The boy’s father said he had been informed by police about the formation of an SIT. “We hope police will soon register an FIR in the case,” he said, adding his son had also received threats over the phone.

Stokes attacked all the bowlers he faced and hit seven fours and three sixes before being caught at long-on off left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj. Ollie Pope fell quickly but Jos Buttler continued the attack, hitting 23 off 18 balls as the lead went beyond 400. South African captain Faf du Plessis chose not to take the second new ball when it was due after a maiden over by Pretorius at the start of play. He perhaps reasoned that Maharaj had a chance of dismissing Stokes early in his innings. The tactic backfired, however, as 28 runs were added in five overs before the new ball was taken, including sixes by Stokes off Pretorius and Maharaj. Stokes played an attacking shot off almost every ball he faced and was undeterred by a let-off on 38 when he top-edged a pull against Kagiso Rabada and wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock ran about 35m but dropped the ball as he dived for it.

My friend Joydeep and I were chatting and smoking when a middle-aged man came up to us and began abusing me for smoking in public.

All the while they continued to beat up my friend. Cops reached the place in some time, but there was more horror in store for us. At the police station, the cops called our parents. Thankfully, my parents are supportive and they stood by me, which possibly angered the officers more. When I told the officer that I wanted to lodge a complaint against the men who attacked us, he refused and threatened to arrest us if we didn’t leave the police station.Finding no other way to fight back, I posted the matter on Facebook, which was shared several times over multiple platforms and the officer in charge called and asked me to come to Dum Dum police station to lodge a complaint. We did so on Wednesday and even identified some of the men in the group. But more than 48 hours have passed and none of them have been arrested. Instead, one of the tormentors has made a Facebook post claiming I attacked him. This man has even dug up some of my old vacation photos from Italy where I was wearing a bikini and reposted them on his profile to cast aspersions on my character.I realise all these activities are meant to demoralise me and tarnish my image.

On June 4, the women’s panel had reportedly written to the senior superintendent of police (SSP) to present a status report on the case in 10 days.

Satnam Singh Dhaliwal, president of Universal Human Rights Organisation (UHRO), said after they saw a video of a woman being dragged by two persons in the social media, they contacted the woman, a widow.

According to Dhaliwal, during the lockdown, the woman had sought ration from the sarpanch, after which one of the accused threw an indecent proposal at her. As she complained to the panchayat about it, the next day, on May 2, the two accused brothers and their wives dragged her out of her home and rape was attempted on her. They also took her to their home, where her hands were allegedly tied and clothes torn, and she was beaten up, said the rights body chief.

“The incident of dragging and attempt to rape was captured by the elder son of the woman, while her other son called police, who got her freed. Later, the accused — two brothers, their father and wives — were booked on various charges, including bid to outrage her modesty. Finding the charges mild, UHRO approached the Khanna SSP, and fresh charges like wrongful restraint and house-trespass were added to the FIR,” he said.

However, still not satisfied with the charges, the UHRO wrote to the Punjab State Women’s commission.

“We are demanding that the police add attempt to rape and abduction sections also in the FIR. The Women’s Commission in its order on June 4 had asked the SSP to present an action-taken report within 10 days, which is over, but they have called neither me nor the woman and as per my information, they have also not sent the action-taken report,” said the petitioner.

Meanwhile, SSP Khanna Harpreet Singh said he has not got any such orders from the woman’s panel. If they receive any such orders, they would definitely send a report, the officer added.

‘Boy trolled, shamed before suicide’

The post

The complaint

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

GURUGRAM: As #BoisLocker-Room unravelled, a 17-year-old girl shared on Instagram this Monday an alleged incident from two years ago.It involved a classmate who had allegedly asked her to perform a sexual act on him in the basement of her housing society. The boy, a Class XII student, was trolled as the girl’s post got shared. The same night, he jumped to death from his 11th-floor flat in a DLF 5 condominium.On Thursday, the boy’s father approached police with a complaint in which he blamed online harassment and trolling for his son’s suicide, sought legal changes in the use of social media by teens, and asked a question: can social media disclosures without the burden of proof be allowed?He wasn’t that kind of a person. You can talk to anyone in his friends’ circle and in his school,” the boy’s father told TOI, referring to the allegations against him. The trolls have now turned on the girl (A in subsequent references), from hailing her bravery three days ago to blaming her for the boy’s death. To cut herself off, she said she has had to deactivate her account, but isn’t going back on what she wrote. “I deactivated my account because of the filth that I was being subjected to after his death. It’s sad he took this step. But, that doesn’t prove my story wrong,” she told TOI.On Monday morning, #BoisLockerRoom dominated conversations online and offline, but among high school students, it was more than that. It was relatable. A and some of her close friends found themselves revealing personal experiences to each other, about objectification, casual sexual aggression and vulgarity that get regularly subjected to, and the ‘normalisation’ of it that angered them.“I told them about my experience. Everyone was shocked. They told me I should no longer be silent and that the story needs to be out there. In that moment, I decided to stand up for myself and tell my story. I knew I’ll be trolled but I wanted to say it,” said A. She put up the post late on Monday, around 10pm. Soon, some of her friends took screenshots and started reposted it, tagging the boy (B from here on). The trolling began immediately. Friends of B told TOI he was shamed, bullied and threatened.“He even pleaded with one of the girl’s friends, who had reposted the story, to take it down and that it was not true. He wanted her to understand his side of the story. But they were relentless. When several people started abusing him online, he panicked. He reached out to us and was sobbing,” said a classmate and close friend of B. “He was always busy with his football, dog, and family. He fell victim to mob justice over baseless allegations,” she added. A said she mentioned the boy’s name but did not tag him. But her friends were angry and began tagging him in their reposts. This led to others being able to identify his account. They were both in Class X when, according to A, B wanted to come and meet her, just a few days after they had become friend. After reaching the A’s society, B allegedly proposed a walk in the basement. There, she claims, he touched her inappropriately. “I was alarmed and pushed him away. I tried running away but he held me and pulled me. He then started demanding sexual favours. I pushed him with greater force and ran upstairs. He came up and told me he had forgotten his wallet in the basement and I should accompany him to find it. I refused and went home. I blocked him everywhere after that,” A said. “I was tired of keeping it inside me. I don’t have proof and I know people would shame me but I had to let it out.”B’s father said the purpose of his complaint wasn’t revenge: he does not want any other parent to go through this. “It is the responsibility of the social media company, the government and other agencies to stop such rumours and false posts that could take anyone’s life,” he said. “I have made a written complaint to police against the parties involved in it -- the girl who wrote the post, Instagram and people who comment and harassed my son. People do not think before making comments on social media and it is very difficult for any child to face such a situation,” he said, adding he will fight against the misuse of social media against juveniles. He said it was immense distress, shame, fear and unbearable anxieties caused by the post that drove his son to suicide.“On the evening of May 5, (a day after the suicide) a classmate of my son who lives in our society informed me about certain events that transpired the previous night between 10.30pm and 11.30pm, which led my son to commit suicide,” B’s father said. “My son was informed by his friends about the post. I was also told that my son also received illegal and unlawful threats on the phone.”A person calling himself the brother of the boy posted from an Instagram account on Thursday that B had received threat calls and texts, after which he had tried to defend himself and also told his friends he was innocent. But he couldn’t handle the constant threat. He was under tremendous pressure and had a panic attack,” read the post.Police commissioner Mohammad Akil said an investigation was on and statements would be recorded. A spokesperson for the school said they were unaware about the police complaint and its content.In Video: Gurugram: Father of Class 12 boy who jumped to death blames girl’s online post"

AHMEDABAD: After a 29-year-old woman from the Shahpur area of the city died after delivering a girl child, her relatives ransacked the private hospital in Manekbaug, where caesarean surgery was performed on the woman. The kin of the deceased woman also assaulted an anaesthetist and abducted him.

Her relatives forced the anaesthetist, Kalpesh Nakum, to record three video confessions at knifepoint, in which he had to say that the woman, Rukhsarbano Pathan, had died due to his negligence.

In his FIR with Ellisbridge police, Nakum said that he had got a call from gynaecologist Dr Dharmishtha Shah of Navkar Hospital near Shreyas Bridge on Wednesday evening. Shah told Nakum that a caesarean surgery needed to be performed immediately.

Nakum rushed to the hospital and gave anaesthesia to Pathan in the operation theatre. Shah was present in the operation at the time of surgery. Pathan delivered a healthy girl child but as she was bleeding profusely, she was rushed to the VS Hospital in Ellisbridge area, states the FIR.

The doctor stated in the FIR that he stayed at the VS Hospital along with Shah where Pathan’s relatives were also present. At around 8pm, he returned to Navkar Hospital for some paperwork. At around 9.30pm, he heard screams from the reception area of the hospital and when he rushed there, he saw three men, aged between 20 and 30. The three men held Nakum and began beating him. They also ransacked the hospital, states the FIR.

One of them hit the anaesthetist on his left eye leaving him severely injured. Then the three men pushed him inside a car parked outside the hospital. While constantly beating Nakum, they took him to an unknown place in Danilimda.

For some time, they stopped the car at Danilimda where another two men came and showed a knife to Nakum and forced him to state that the woman had died due to his negligence.

They then hired an autorickshaw and told the rickshaw driver to drop him at Narol Circle.

After reaching Narol at around 11pm on Wednesday, Nakum gave his location to police who reached there and took him to Ellisbridge police station.

Doctors gather at police station

A group of around 20 doctors went to Ellisbridge police station after the incident of abduction and assault came to light. The doctors gathered to represent the issue and to show solidarity with Nakum, said Ellisbridge PI, A S Patel. An official of Ellisbridge police said the deceased’s family was overwhelmed with grief as the woman had died while delivering her first child. The police official said that they did not yet take any statement of the deceased’s family as they were busy in burial. The official said that the postmortem is being conducted at VS Hospital and the cause of death can be ascertained only after receiving the report.

Where were the cops?

The accused persons abducted Nakum from Manekbaug and the car passed by Bhudarpura, Parimal Garden, Mahalakshmi Crossroads, Jamalpur, Behrampura, and finally went to Danilimda area. During this time, they were constantly beating the doctor. But not a single cop spotted the offence and even control room cops, who are said to monitor CCTV cameras on road to prevent crimes, missed the incident. Also, this incident occurred at a time when the police is on alert ahead of New Year festivities and they claim foolproof bandobust has been made to prevent crimes. Nakum was forced to confess his crime on video once near Behrampura police chowky, but the cops didn’t even notice.

Sources informed that on June 2, forest guard of Churni beat Anjali Aathave was on routine patrolling round in compartment number 36 when she noticed five domestic cattle grazing in the core area. Aathave issued a preliminary offence report (POR) and seized the cattle and placed them at Vairat camp for further action. These cattle belonged to Sakharam Dhandekar.

On June 5, when Aathave was on her way to Vairat, Gangubai Dhandekar, wife of Sakharam, confronted her and asked why she had initiated action and seized cattle. Dhandekar allegedly abused Aathave and also physically assaulted her.

Aathave reported the matter to seniors and a complaint was filed at Chikhaldara police station as well as with controlling officers. Police have recorded statements of the accused and further action is underway.

Gugamal ACF RK Patwari said, “The accused’s kin Lalman Dhandekar is police-patil and currently resides in Pastalai. There have been numerous complaints lodged with district administration against Dhandekar regarding illegal activities.”

The core area of MTR under Gugamal wildlife division has 12 villages. Of these, Koha and Kund were rehabilitated in 2003-04 and Vairat & Churni in 2011-12. Dolar, Memana, Mangiya, Rora and Pastalai have been taken up for rehabilitation since 2017-18.

Of these villages, Dolar and Memana have been fully relocated while relocation of Rora and Mangiya is going on. Besides, 98% of Pastalai has been rehabilitated. The Dhandekars are the only ones who have refused to move out despite accepting Option–I package (voluntary relocation).

Pastalai consisted of 155 families of which 150 families have been rehabilitated at Yewata and Vadgaon Fattehpur about 18 months ago. The remaining five — Dhandekars and kin — are not moving out.

These families belong to group of beneficiaries who have settled at Vadgaon Fattehpur under Option-1 package comprising Rs10 lakh per family. However, they are not moving out to the new site citing flimsy reasons, sources said. These five families are living in the tiger reserve core area and are regularly involved in illegal grazing, tree felling and damage to wildlife habitat.

The area where Dhandekars live has presence of sloth bears, leopards, as well as tigress with cubs. Ignoring the potential danger these animals pose to the families, they are refusing to relocate, said sources adding that they have been filing “fake” complaints against forest officers.

“Lalman Dhandekar is not leaving the place for simple reason that he will lose the job of police-patil,” said patwari. When all others from the village have already shifted, for whom Dhandekar will work, asked the patwari.

NAVI MUMBAI: A Belapur-based woman, who protested against an illegal trimming of a tree in her area and also video recorded it, was assaulted on Sunday evening.

An FIR has been lodged against one accused by the NRI coastal police station.

""On Sunday evening, I came to know that several branches of a green and healthy tamarind tree were being chopped at the behest of some residents of Kartik Regency in Belapur . I immediately went down and told the locals that they cannot do tree trimming without the requisite permission from the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation . There are several birds' nests on this tree, and hence I told them not to cut the branches illegally,"" said Paramdeep Kaur Garewal, an activist.

``While I was video recording the illegal tree cutting from outside, one man identified as Himanshu Mishra started objecting to the filming and forcefully grabbed my hand in which I was holding my mobile phone. He wanted to snatch my phone, but I did not let it go; so he twisted my hand. I somehow managed to free my hand and ran to the police station to complain against him,'' she said.

Police have booked the accused man under section 354 of the Indian Penal code.

RTI activist Anarjit Chauhan told TOI: ``The NMMC officials have informed me that no permission was given for tree trimming in this Belapur case.

Vijayawada: Even as videos of police beating people on roads and other public places during the lockdown went viral, the police department is yet to initiate action against the officials for their excesses.

Sources in Director General of Police (DGP) office said that inquiries have been ordered in all the incidents and action will be taken only after receiving the reports.

In the Dachepalli incident that took place at the border of AP and Telangana on Thursday night, the cops booked cases against those who pelted stones at the cops. As the police stopped people from entering into AP unless they agree to go on quarantine, clashes broke out between the cops and the people headed to their native places in AP from Telangana.

While the people pelted stones at the cops after heated arguments, the cops unleashed force by caning them. The videos of the police beating people including women went viral on social media platforms.

The cops said a DSP rank officer and five other cops on duty were injured in the stone pelting and lathicharge was done to control the situation.

In the Peravali incident, where a sub-inspector was seen beating up a man who returned from abroad, the home minister had announced his suspension but, the higher officials have reconsidered the decision after taking the cop’s version into consideration.

Sources in the DGP’s office said the SI had been working for the last four days and the man returned from abroad ignored repeated requests by the cops to stay in home isolation. He took the extreme measure only to keep him in isolation as a last resort, said the sources.

Even in other incidents reported at Hanuman Junction, Kurnool and other places across the state, the department has backed its officials. Sources in the DGP office said that the police took the extreme action only after running out of all options.

On the other hand, Piduguralla CI was placed under vacant reserve for dereliction of duties as he was not properly monitoring the people placed under home quarantine.

ISLAMABAD: A Pakistan-based American blogger has accused three senior leaders of the opposition Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) of raping and assaulting her in 2011.

Cynthia D Ritchie made the allegation through a video clip posted on her Facebook page on Friday and soon it went viral on social media.

""In 2011, I was raped by the former interior minister Rehman Malik. That's right, I'll say it again. I was raped by the then interior minister Rehman Malik,"" she claimed.

She also said that former prime minister Yousuf Raza Gilani and former health minister Makhdoom Shahabuddin ""physically manhandled"" her while Gilani was staying at the ""President's House"" in Islamabad.

Ritchie's allegations have escalated the already bitter row between her and the party after she posted a comment on a tweet on May 28 against slain PPP leader and former prime minister Benzair Bhutto, which was termed as derogatory by the party leaders who filed a complaint against her at the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).

Her comments came on a tweet discussing the violent confrontation between model Uzma Khan and a woman, who accused the former of having a relationship with her husband of 13 years and used this allegation to justify her violent treatment of the model.

""This echoes stories of what BB used to do when her husband cheated. She'd have the guards rape the women. Why do women condone this rape culture? Why aren't the men ever held accountable? Where is the justice system?"" Ritchie wrote the comment on the tweet.

According to media reports, PPP, on the same day, filed a complaint with the FIA against Ritchie for ""hateful comments and slander"" against Bhutto.

In another post, Ritchie said that the rape assault against her took place at Malik's house in the Ministers' Enclave around the time of the raid in which Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was killed in Pakistan in 2011.

""I thought it (was) a meeting about my visa but I was given flowers/a drugged drink,"" she wrote.

He also said that she kept mum as no one in the then PPP government helped her.

PPP was in power from 2008 until 2013 and Gilani was the prime minister until he was removed by the Supreme Court in June 2012 for disobeying court orders.

Ritchie also said she had informed about the incident to ""someone"" at the US Embassy in Pakistan in 2011, ""but due to 'fluid' situation and 'complex' relations between US and Pakistan, [the] response was less than adequate"".

Referring to her ongoing battle with the PPP, she said it was not really about that tweet but about the individuals who know she had a lot of dirt on a lot of people in Pakistan.

“It is primarily those who use and abuse others, particularly women and the vulnerable population. And I am one of them,” Ritchie was quoted as saying by Dawn newspaper.

However, Gilani has denied the charges and said that he is even considering responding to such allegations, ""humiliation and disgrace"".

While talking to ARY News, he was asked what Richie was doing at the Presidency when she was allegedly manhandled, and why she had been staying in Pakistan.

Gilani alleged that she had come to Pakistan as part of a campaign to malign politicians.

""Who has given them the right to malign politicians?"" he asked.

He said Ritchie was maligning him because his two sons had filed a defamation case against her for her allegedly defamatory tweet against Bhutto.

However, the two former ministers have not so far responded to the allegations.

GHAZIABAD: A four-year-old boy was rescued from Moradabad , 15 days after he was allegedly kidnapped by a woman while he was playing outside his home in Sudamapuri area , police said on Wednesday.

The cops have also arrested four persons in connection with the case. The police found the arrested accused are part of a gang that “kidnapped and sold” children in other cities.

According to police, the accused — Tarun (20), Rohit (25), and Kamlesh (55, also Rohit’s mother) — are residents of Vijay Nagar. Meanwhile, Rampal alias Rajbahadur (45), is from Moradabad. The cops are still tracing the woman who took the child from outside his house.

On June 29, a woman from Lal Quarter in Sudamapuri lodged a missing complaint at Vijay Nagar police station. She said that her son was playing outside with other children when she sent him to a shop to buy a milk packet. When the boy didn’t return for over an hour, she went looking. Unable to trace him, she went to the cops who lodged the case under IPC Section 363 (kidnapping).

She also told the cops that she suspected her ex-husband to be behind the kidnapping. However, police found a CCTV footage in which two men could be seen with the boy on a bike. The men were then traced.

Rajeev Singh, SHO (Vijay Nagar), said the accused confessed that the woman who kidnapped the child took the boy to an empty shop where Rohit and Tarun were waiting. “Rohit and Tarun took the boy and handed him over to Kamlesh, who knew Rampal,” he added. Rampal had fixed a deal with a person in Moradabad for Rs 2 lakh. “A police office contacted Rampal four days ago and introduced himself as a customer, claiming he had been married for several years but had no children. The cop offered him Rs 3 lakh for the boy,” he said.

“Rampal asked the cop to reach Moradabad. Police arrested him and rescued the boy,” he added. Police have also recovered the two-wheeler that was used in the crime.

HYDERABAD: A one-and-half year-old toddler ’s kidnapping mystery was solved with Task Force police rescuing the child from Kalapathar on Thursday. He was handed over to child welfare department officials. On May 13 evening, Rohini, 22-year-old pavement dweller, lodged a complaint with Chaderghat police alleging that unknown people had abducted her one-and-half-year-old son while she was sleeping on the footpath with the boy.

“Rohini, a widowused to stay near Malakpet railway station bridge. Recently, she moved near Niagara hotel in Chaderghat. On May 13 morning, Rohini ate some food sitting near Niagara hotel on the footpath and, in a drunken condition, dozed off after a while. She woke up and noticed that her son was missing and searched for him in nearby areas and, after failing to locate him, lodged a complaint with police,” Chaderghat sub-inspector (SI) S Chandrasekhar Reddy said .

Task Force police were assigned the job of tracing the boy and they analysed CCTV camera footage of the area near Niagara hotel in Chaderghat. After analysing the footage of 40 CCTV cameras, police zeroed-in on the suspect, 27-year-old Mohammed Ibrahim, an auto driver-cum-fruit vendor of Aman Nagar in Talabkatta. “He was found abducting the boy on his bike after offering him fruits,” Task Force inspector Srinivas said.

Ibrahim told police that he has a daughter and wanted a son. “Ibrahim claimed that he and his wife lost more than one boy during their infancy due to illnesses. Desperate for a son, Ibrahim decided to kidnap Rohini’s son and he observed her routine for three days before executing his plan,” the SI said.

The accused was handed over to Chaderghat police and he was sent in judicial remand under Section 363 (kidnapping) of the Indian Penal Code. Police handed over the boy to child welfare department officials as Rohini is addicted to liquor. “About a year ago, Rohini’s brother-in-law forcibly took away the boy as she was not taking care of him due to liquor addiction. At that time, we booked a case against him and handed over the boy to Rohini. After the recent incident, we handed over the body to child welfare officials,” the SI said.

GHAZIABAD: A 36-year-old project manager with a Ghaziabad-based construction company went missing on his way back home from his Patel Nagar office on Friday night. His Toyota Innova Crysta was found 100km away in Muzaffarnagar. Police said there were blood stains on the back of the driver’s seat.

Vikram Tyagi, a resident of KPD Grand Savanna society in Raj Nagar Extension, worked at his uncle’s company — Rajeshwar Builders — which has constructed several highrises across the state. Vikram is said to have left office around 7.30pm on Friday and had apparently stopped at a liquor outlet to buy booze on his way home. He had last spoken to his wife Nidhi around 7.45pm, telling her over the phone that he was just 100 metres from the society gate and would come home in 5 minutes. Vikram stays with his wife and two children — a 12-year-old son and an eight-year-old daughter.

When he did not reach home by 8.30pm, Vikram’s family members tried calling him on his cellphone, but it was switched off. The next morning, his relatives approached police, and got an FIR registered under IPC Section 365 (kidnapping or abduction with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine a person).

Vikram's cousin Abhay Tyagi said the family had searched all the roads around the society on Friday night. “We had checked almost all areas in Raj Nagar Extension when he did not come home even after 10pm. We went to his office, but it was locked. We spend the whole of Friday night trying to trace him on our own. On Saturday, we went to the cops,” he added.

The family suspects Vikram may have been kidnapped. “He would not have been robbed. He never carried a wallet. That day, he only had some Rs 1,500 and his credit card with him,” Abhay said.

The last location of Vikram’s phone was found near Gaur Cascades in Raj Nagar Extension, which is just a few metres ahead of his society.

On Saturday evening, police told the builder ’s family they had found Vikram’s Innova in Muzaffarnagar. According to his cousin, a police team deployed at a checkpoint in Khatauli area of Muzaffarnagar had stopped the Innova around 1am. There were two men inside, and they apparently told the cops they were associated with Delhi Police.

“When one of the cops peered inside the vehicle with his torch, he found blood stains at the back of the driver’s seat. Asked what was wrong, the man at the wheel stepped on the accelerator. The cops chased them for 15km, but they managed to flee in the darkness. The car that was found abandoned 40km away did not have any number plate,” Abhay said.

When the Innova was found, its rear portion was damaged, suggesting it had been rammed by another vehicle from behind. Vikram’s car is unlikely to have crossed any toll plaza as money had not been deducted from his Fastag account. “The accused may have taken some village road to reach Muzaffarnagar,” a senior officer said.

Police in four districts — Ghaziabad, Hapur, Meerut and Muzaffarnagar — are scanning footage from 500 CCTV cameras to look for clues. “The builder has gone missing under mysterious circumstances and efforts are on to trace him. His car was found in Muzaffarnagar. We have formed eight teams to work on the case. We expect a breakthrough soon,” Ghaziabad SSP Kalanidhi Naithani said.

The case bears resemblance to the manner in which Gaurav Chandel, who worked with a private firm in Gurgaon, had gone missing in January this year in Noida. Chandel was returning from office when he was allegedly attacked and his car snatched at gunpoint. His body was found near Gaur Chowk, five minutes away from his house in Gaur City.

KANPUR: The teenage student, whose family had received ransom demand messages on Facebook, had himself created a fake profile and sent them to fake his own kidnapping . Police recovered the boy from Ghantaghar area near Kanpur Central railway station after locating his presence there through technical surveillance.

The boy, Swayam Kumar. a student of Class 12, was missing from January 24. He had left home to go to school in Cantonment area from his Om Purwa Chakeri residence in the morning but instead went to Lucknow with a group of friends without intimating his family.

He could not return in time and thought his parents would be worried and will scold him for skipping school and going to Lucknow without informing them.

Inspector, Chakeri police station, Ranjit Rai, said, “We traced the missing boy with the help of electronic surveillance. He had faked his kidnapping out of fear.”

The boy feared scolding from his parents for going to Lucknow without seeking permission from them and so he faked his kidnapping, Rai added.

Police had received a complaint on January 26 from the boy’s parents that their son had been kidnapped and Rs1lakh ransom was demanded for his safe release through messages on Facebook accounts of family members.

When police officials registered a case and started investigations, they found that the boy had faked his kidnapping and created a fake Facebook account and sent ransom message to his mother and aunt.

Police put the boy’s phone on technical surveillance and found his location in the city. Police rescued the boy from Ghantaghar area close to Kanpur Central station on late Tuesday evening when he was about to leave and handed him over to his parents later.

The Malwani police are now probing if Lakshmi Khanna (26) and Sridevi Sharnappa (30) were involved in a child kidnapping racket .

They managed to lure two of them, aged 9 and 11, with chocolates and offers of money, and started walking away from the garden. The third child was confused by this, and started following his friends, while calling out for them.

Meanwhile, locals who noticed the women walking away with the children sensed something amiss. They stopped the women and inquired where they were taking the children. When the duo failed to come up with satisfactory answers, the locals immediately called the police. The children were sent back to their families.

“Khanna and Sharnappa have been booked on charges of kidnapping. They said they hailed from Karjat. Their male accomplice was named Sharad. We are checking CCTV footage to find out if the three were together, and which other locations they visited,” said an officer.

Accused Ranveer (kneeled down) in police custody

BHOPAL: A Class 12 student in MP’s Morena district cooked up a bizarre plan to skip his board exams that started on Monday. He allegedly kidnapped his three-year-old nephew from a family function and left a note warning the family “not to allow him to take the exams”.

The toddler spent all night tied up in a field, weeping and helpless to defend himself if any animal came by. It’s a miracle he was unhurt when police rescued him on Monday morning.

The accused, 18-year-old Ranveer, did get his wish, though. Now that he is in custody, he probably won’t be able to give his exam.

Ranveer’s family were visiting a relative at Tudila village in Jaura region of the district — about 450km north of Bhopal — on Sunday. He was supposed to write his Hindi board paper on Monday. Morena SP Asit Yadav told TOI that police got a call on Dial 100 at 3.10am on Monday that a 3-year-old child had been kidnapped from Tudila. “The family found a letter, which said that the accused — who is a relative of the kidnapped child — should not be allowed to appear in board examinations,” Yadav added.

Based on the letter, police searched Ranveer’s room in neighbouring Pipraua village. “Some notebooks were found, where the handwriting was found to match with that of the letter. On suspicion, we questioned the accused. He admitted that he had kidnapped his cousin’s son and left him tied up in a farm at around 9pm on Sunday,” Yadav said, adding: “Ranveer wanted to avoid giving the examinations at any cost. He thought that in all this commotion he will not be allowed to appear for the board exam.”

The toddler was weeping when he was rescued. “Ranveer claimed that he intended to bring the kid back after he was excused from the examination,” Yadav said. There was initially some confusion over whether the accused is a juvenile. “He is not a minor,” the SP confirmed. Asked if Ranveer can still appear in the examination, Yadav said, “The court will decide.”

PATNA: Police on late Monday night arrested one Mishal Ranjan (22) for his alleged involvement in the kidnapping of a youth at gunpoint from Patliputra roundabout. The youth was kidnapped in a SUV and taken to the basement of Maharaja Kameshwar Complex near Dak Bungalow roundabout and thrashed mercilessly.

The victim was identified as Ankit Singh (22). He is a resident of Siddeshwar Nagar under Patliputra police station area.

The incident took place around 8pm and police rescued him within an hour from the Maharaja complex. SSP Upendra Sharma and City SP (central) Vinay Tiwary rushed to the spot after the matter was brought to their knowledge.

An FIR was lodged with Patliputra police station on Ankit’s statement. At least three more named accused are absconding.

Tiwary said Mishal was detained from the spot immediately after rescuing Ankit. “More than a dozen of sticks, rods and other blunt weapons were seized from there,” he said.

In reply to a query, the SP said no firearms were recovered. “He was rushed to a hospital for treatment due to injuries received from thrashing. The matter was related to rivalry between two groups,” he said.

Meanwhile, Anshuman Singh, who accompanied Ankit when he was kidnapped, said Mishal was continuously threatening and abusing them on phone for helping a youth named Lucky whose high-end bike was forcefully snatched by the accused from a gym at Nageshwar Colony around a fortnight back. Anshuman is a resident of New Patliputra Colony.

“That bike was later recovered with the help of police but no action was taken against Mishal that time as his family is well connected to influential people. He continued to threaten us since then, leading to the Monday night incident,” he said.

Anshuman said at least 35-40 people, including Mishal and his relatives, had reached the spot in four separate SUVs.

“They first tried to drag me inside but Ankit pushed them apart. After that Mishal and other pointed gun at Ankit, hit him hard with pistol’s butt and dragged him inside one of the SUVs,” Anshuman said, adding Ankit’s cellphone was snatched and he received multiple stitches on his head.

Anshuman said he along with his one more friend rushed to Patliputra police station and informed the policemen about the incident. “We came to know from police that Ankit was taken to a marketing complex. We immediately reached there followed by the police,” he added.

Crude oil tanker Shinyo Saowalak has now been rechristened Nave Constellation

MUMBAI: For 19 seafarers from crude oil tanker Nave Constellation, bringing in New Year with their families was a big deal. Gun-toting pirates had kidnapped the group, 18 of them Indians, in Nigeria last month and had forced them to camp near a crocodile-infested swamp with minimal food. Recounting details crew members said they may never be able to put the harrowing experience behind them.

The ship set sail from Singapore on October 27 with 26 crew members. They were to load cargo in Nigeria and head back to India. Armed securitymen had been hired to escort the vessel after it left the Bonny Offshore Terminal as the Gulf of Guinea is a high-risk area. But the securitymen never arrived and the vessel departed without them on December 3.

""It was dark when six gun-toting pirates climbed onto the ship with ladders. They pushed the Captain and the chief officer to the floor,"" said a crew member. This was their fifth time kidnapping a crew, the pirates said. The pirates looted the vault in the Captain's cabin and forced all 26 crew to climb down the drainage pipes with them to reach the main deck. Seven crew were left on the ship while the rest including a woman were bundled into the pirates' boat.

""We sailed for 12 hours till we reached a river. Suddenly, the pirates made us duck in their boat and threw a tarpaulin over our heads. We travelled for another two hours till we could hear the beating of drums. We had arrived by a camp near a swamp with 40 armed pirates. After walking through muck, we were made to sit on the bare ground. We ate nothing that day,"" said a crew member.

The next day, the hostages were moved into makeshift sheds. Food consisted of one bowl of rice a day or some noodles. An armed pirate would escort hostages whenever they went to relieve themselves in the open.

""On the second day of the abduction, there was sound of gunfire and we were instructed to run. A rival gang of pirates had attacked the camp, wanting to 'steal' us. There were explosions all around and the commander who had kidnapped us was killed. After that, we moved locations every night, fearing more attacks. On the eleventh day of our abduction we were moved to a ""safe spot"", again near the river where we stayed till the end,"" said the crew member. The pirates used satellite phones for communication.

The hostages would spend the days chatting in hushed tones. ""Everyone was terrified, but we tried to take our minds off things by recounting old shipping stories. We did not know if we would see our families,"" said a crew member. On the eighteenth day, the hostages were taken out by boat to be released. But the pirates found out that a representative of the ship management company who was supposed to bring the ransom had been robbed by another gang. The hostages had to stay on the same boat till the next day when the ship management and the pirates worked out a deal.

""We were dropped a little away from the shore at Port Harcourt where armed military men escorted us to a hotel by bus. Three of us had contracted malaria. After medical treatment and sorting out procedures with the Nigerian government authorities, we finally flew out of the country on December 28,"" said a member of the crew.

KOLKATA: Two days after an ambulance ran over 52-year-old Gopal Pramanick, seconds after the occupants of the vehicle allegedly tried to kidnap his daughter-in-law Priyanka Pramanick (28), the police claimed to have found several inconsistencies in her statement. After studying a CCTV footage , a senior police officer said: “If the evidence does not add up during the probe, we will lodge an FIR against the complainant.”The cops, however, have started a case under IPC sections 357 (assault or criminal force in attempt wrongfully to confine a person) and 341 (wrongful restraint) along with Section 34, based on the woman’s complaint. This is besides the case under IPC section pertaining to culpable homicide not amounting to murder, which had already been registered.According to police, not only did she conceal the fact that another relative was walking right next to her and her three-year-old daughter, she had also failed to explain why she failed to lodge her complaint immediately after the accident. The CCTV footage runs for 74 seconds from 11.53pm on Tuesday. After the first 32 seconds, Priyanka is seen walking — her daughter on her right and her aunt (mami-shasuri) Rita Pramanik her left — along the left side of the road.A couple of steps behind, Gopal is seen following them. He is actually spotted on the road. Four more relatives — in batches of two each — are seen moving towards their home.The accident took place between 55 and 59 seconds in the 74-second footage and by the 60th second the ambulance is visible with the family members running behind it. “How is it that everything took place in seconds? How can someone stop, converse and then pick up speed that can kill a person by dragging him along?” questioned an IPs officer at Lalbazar.Lalbazar’s response came barely hours after residents of Christopher Road in Tangra took to the road and blocked it claiming the police was deliberately trying to pass off a serious crime against woman and a culpable homicide leading to the death of a 52-year-old man as a mere accident.The protestors blocked GK Road using drums and carried currency notes. “We want to bribe the cops, just as a bribe has let them change the course of this case. May be once we bribe them, they will bring out the truth,” claimed Tapan Pramanick, a relative of the victim."

AGARTALA: kidnapping of a minor girl after killing her grandfather in Indiranagar village of Melaghar in Sepahijala district was brought to Agartala by Tripura police after he was arrested in Chennai.

He was produced in court here and was subsequently sent to police custody. Police have sought custodial trial of the accused and have launched a search to arrest three of his accomplices. The girl, who was forced to marry the accused, has been rescued from the rented accommodation in Chennai.

Police said Rajib Hussain has been accused of kidnapping a minor girl and murdering her grandfather on the night

of March 2 this year. The grandfather, police said, had tried to prevent the abduction attempt. The girl was alone at home at the time of the incident and both her grandfathers had gone to a nearby mosque, police said.

Sources said Rajib was in a relationship with the girl, but she did not want to get married before completing her studies. This infuriated the youth and he decided to abduct the girl from the house.

“We came out (of the mosque) after hearing her screams for help and found that she was being forcefully pushed into acar by Rajib and others. On finding no other way to stop them, my brother and I stood in the way, hopinh they would stop. But Rajib drove the car and hit my brother, who died on the spot. I was injured in the incident,” said the other grandfather of the victim.

Rajib managed to escape with her to Chennai the next day. The victim’s family alleged that despite repeated pleas, the police did not take any action to arrest the accused or rescue the girl. “Finally, I wrote to the police chief and the chief minister, narrating the details on November 18; after which action was initiated.”

Tracking Rajib’s mobile location and on the basis of his communication with the family, Tripura police, with the help of their Chennai counterparts, arrested him last week from the outskirts of Chennai. Based on his statement, police rescued the girl from their rented accommodation.

CHENNAI: Police arrested a gang of three women who posed as cops and attempted to kidnap a woman railway employee at Guindy station on Thursday.

The incident created panic after the victim started running around crying for help.

The kidnap plan was hatched after one of the accused thought the victim was having an affair with her boyfriend and tried to threaten her.

At 6am on Thursday, the 42-year-ols woman’s husband dropped her at Velachery station. As she was walking towards the foot overbridge to board a train a woman in police uniform and a man in plain clothes intercepted her. Two other women in salwar kameez were standing a few meters away from the woman carrying a handcuff. They asked her to get into a cab as they had to question her ‘in connection with a criminal case’. When she tried to call her husband they allegedly snatched the phone.

Panicked, the woman ran towards the staircase raising an alarm and the duo allegedly chased her. Noticing a few passersby coming to her rescue, the woman in uniform escaped while the man was secured and handed over to the Guindy police.

During interrogation, the man identified as Jeevanatham told police that he was the cab driver. One Balaguru hired him for the women and that he accompanied them believing that they were real cops. After questioning Balaguru, police arrested Vadhini, 40, Muthulakshmi, 35 and Tamilselivi, 30.

Interrogation revealed that Vadhini who runs a garments showroom was in relationship with Kishore, a clerk at Mambalam railway station and a colleague of the woman.

“Vadhini mistook their friendship for an affair and decided to kidnap and threaten her to break ties with the man,” said an investigating officer. Since she runs a garments showroom she managed to arrange police uniform through a friend. She took the help of her friends Muthulakshmi of Avadi and Tamilselvi of Villivakkam.

All the three women were remanded in judicial custody. Balaguru and Jeevanatham were released as they did not know anything about the plot, police said.

After chasing Awana’s SUV for over 20 minutes, the two cars finally managed to overtake and corner the Fortuner near Rampur Market in Beta II. “My SUV got sandwiched between their two vehicles. The accused subsequently came out of their cars and fired two shots in the air before starting to damage the front, rear and side window panes of my SUV,” Awana said.

Awana said he somehow managed to escape from their clutches and soon informed the Beta II police station. Cops later took him and his father to the spot for a probe.

“It was an attempt to kidnap my son, the accused have a criminal background, they are in their 20s and carry guns and roam around with private bodyguards. We seek action against them,” said Sudhir Awana, his father.

PUNE: The Pune police on Thursday invoked provisions of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) against four persons, including a police constable and a woman, arrested for kidnapping a doctor from Hadapsar on May 30 for Rs10lakh ransom and releasing him after collecting Rs5.89lakh from him.

The police are also searching for their four other accomplices, including another woman.

On June 2, a crime branch team had arrested constable Sameer Thorat , a Hadapsar resident posted with police headquarters at Shivajinagar, Pradip Dnyandev Phasge (37) of Manjari, Kailas Bhanudas Avachite (38) of Hadapsar and Aarti Prabhakar Chavan (29) of Phursungi after a 48-year-old doctor approached the police with a complaint.

According to a proposal moved by the crime branch under additional commissioner of police Ashok Morale and deputy commissioner of police Bachchan Singh , the arrested four are part of an eight-member organised gang which is into kidnapping financially well off individuals by threatening them with molestation cases against their women accomplices and forcing them to pay money.

The gang has similar cases registered against them at Barshi in rural Solapur and Solapur city, apart from a case registered in Pune, the proposal stated.

Commissioner of police K Venkatesham gave his nod to the proposal on Thursday, a crime branch officer told TOI.

Singh said, “The two women involved in the crime have led their male accomplices into committing multiple offences and we are also investigating their involvement in other offences in Pune city.”

Thorat’s lawyers Vijaysingh Thombre and Hitesh Sonar told TOI, “The MCOCA provisions cannot be invoked against the constable as he has no previous criminal record and has been framed in the crime.”

NEW DELHI: A cryptocurrency trader was kidnapped by four criminals , including two juveniles , and forced to pay in Bitcoin for his release. The accused had interacted with the trader by posing as customers.

The victim, Arpit, was made to sit in a car in east Delhi and taken to outer Delhi where he was forced to transfer cryptocurrency at gunpoint. The abductors also called his younger brother, Harshit, seeking ransom for his release.

DCP (East) Jasmeet Singh said, “One of the accused, Vikram (32), is a graduate, while the other, Nitin Yadav (20), is in his second-year of graduation being done through correspondence. They had roped in the juveniles to identify Bitcoin traders. Vikram saw videos on YouTube to understand the trading system and decided to extort traders by posing as a buyer.”

Last Friday, police got a call about the trader being kidnapped from Ganesh Nagar. Harshit told police that his brother had gone to collect cash from a buyer. Later, he got a call from the kidnappers demanding money for Arpit’s release. After checking CCTV footage, police zeroed in on an Innova that was used to kidnap the trader. A wireless message was flashed across the city and the victim was rescued from Auchandi border. The Innova was found robbed from a cab driver in Kanjhawala.

The victim told police that the accused were conversing in Haryanvi and often called him a sadharan (simple) man. Hearing this, Harshit said that a Bitcoin buyer had spoken to him in the same manner two days ago. The buyer had met him twice, but refused the deal at the last moment. He had come in an Ertiga bearing a Haryana numberplate.

“We scanned the records or criminals who had used similar modus operandi and got in touch with informers. On Sunday, we got a tip-off that the accused men were in outer Delhi. The four were apprehended from Kakrola, Rohini, Sultanpur Dabas and Harveli village,” said DCP Singh.

Vikram told police that he earlier drove a cab, but didn’t earn enough to pay back his loans. He started watching videos online and decided to extort cryptocurrency traders. The accused booked the Innova from Gurgaon and then carjacked it. They forced the cab driver at gunpoint to stay in a farmhouse until they executed their plan.

“One of the accused called both brothers separately telling them he wanted to purchase Bitcoin in cash. Both Harshit and his brother didn’t know they were talking to the same person. Arpit agreed to meet them near Ganesh Chowk from where they abducted him. They asked him to transfer two Bitcoins worth Rs 14 lakh. However, he could only transfer 0.75 Bitcoin worth Rs 5 lakh. He was then let go near the border,” said an investigating officer.

PATNA: The Kaimur police on Monday arrested a CRPF jawan for faking his kidnapping to get ransom from his father.

The constable, Rajdev Kumar Gupta, was recovered from a train between Patna and Bhabhua in Kaimur on Monday, six days after his alleged kidnapping by unknown criminals from Buxar-Thakura road under the Noan police station area of the district on January 27.

The victim’s wife, Nandini Kumari, had apprehended the involvement of Gupta’s stepbrother, who was detained by police. The suspect, however, denied his involvement in the kidnapping of Gupta, who was posted in Andhra Pradesh.

Nandini had told the investigating officers that her husband was kidnapped for ransom as her father-in-law had received Rs 30 lakh after selling some ancestral land in the village recently. The kidnappers had allegedly demanded Rs 18 lakh as ransom for his release.

Kaimur SP Dilnawaz Ahmad said, “Our investigation revealed that the CRPF jawan had been in constant touch with his wife ever since the kidnapping was reported to police. He, however, kept moving from one place to another and talked to his wife from different phone numbers.”

On Monday, when the location of Gupta’s cellphone was traced near Mohania in Kaimur, police rushed to the place and recovered him.

“During investigation, it came to light that a sum of Rs 6 lakh was transferred to Gupta’s bank account from his father’s to pay the ransom money to the alleged kidnappers. In fact, Gupta had taken a Rs10 lakh loan and had enacted the drama of his false kidnapping to return the money,” the SP said.

The role of Gupta also came under the scanner after the Andhra police disclosed that the CRPF jawan had been missing from duty since December 3 last year. The officials of the central force apprehended that he might have been kidnapped by the Left extremists operating in the region and subsequently a missing complaint was lodged.

Gupta, who is a native of Buxar district , was produced before a court at Bhabhua, which later remanded him to judicial custody for 14 days.

LUCKNOW: The 21-year-old missing BSc student whose unrecognizable, badly-burnt body was found on Saturday evening from Harchandpur in Rae Bareli, three kilometres away from her college and identified on Sunday, had been kidnapped for forced marriage and set ablaze for resisting, alleged her father in his complaint to police on Monday.

The family members and relatives staged a protest by keeping her corpse on main road in Bachhrawan. The girl, a resident of Bachhrawan, had gone to college on Saturday, but her body was recovered from thickets in Harchandpur area of Lucknow-Allahabad highway.

The girl’s father has accused one Atul Gupta (25), saying he had proposed to his daughter few days ago while she was returning from college. “Despite my daughter’s clear refusal, Atul misbehaved with her on many occasions, after which we took up the matter with his family, but 15 days ago he threatened her with dire consequences if she didn’t marry him,” he alleged.

Acting on the complaint, Rae Bareli police lodged an FIR against Atul Gupta on charges of murder, concealing evidence, criminal intimidation, and causing hurt. SP, Rae Bareli, Swapnil Mamgain told TOI, “Atul, a distant relative of the girl, has been nabbed but is denying charges. He runs a cloth store in Shivratanganj, Amethi. We have detained four other persons also and are questioning them.”

“The post-mortem report of victim rules out rape and mentions burns as the cause of death. We will recreate the crime scene to ascertain the sequence of events since kidnapping a 21-year-old and setting her afire cannot be done by one man,” Mamgain said.

A source privy to probe, however, said the victim had told a friend to carry her bag home and tell her parents that she had been kidnapped, but they did not report it to police and complained a day later.

PUNE: A man in a drunken stupor made a fake kidnap call to his wife, prompting the Warje police to scour the jungles in the area all through Tuesday night in search of him.

In the end, he was found snoring away at his relative’s place in Mumbai!

Police did not press any charges against him after he admitted to making the hoax call.

The 40-year-old, an employee of a private company in the city, had a drink too many on Tuesday and lost his senses, said police.

He called his wife and told her that some people had kidnapped him and confined him in a jungle in Warje area.

He told her that the kidnappers had beaten him black and blue.

After receiving the call, the man’s wife rushed to the police station and pleaded with the officials to rescue her husband from the clutches of kidnappers.

Police initially made attempts to contact him on his cell phone, but it was found to be switched off.

Senior police inspector Ashok Kadam from Warje police station and his team searched all the jungles in the area, but failed to trace him.

Police teams also fanned out and carried out night-long search operations in the jungles in Dukkar Khind, near Garden City, and on NDA road. Police also conducted searches in the overflowing nullahs.

But despite all their efforts, they failed to trace him. Police then tried to track down the ‘kidnappers’, but failed to find any possible leads. When all their efforts came to naught, they received a tip off on Wednesday morning that the man was asleep at the residence of his relative in Mumbai.

On Wednesday evening, he turned up at the police station and said no one had kidnapped him. He said he had made the hoax call to his wife under the influence of alcohol.

HYDERABAD: A three-year-old girl’s kidnap case was cracked within three hours with the help of CCTV footage. Bowenpally police tracked the girl, travelling on a bus, and with the help of their Ramayampet counterparts nabbed the kidnapped and reunited the girl with her mother.

The body was found some 30 hours after the crime at Dunda Maroti on the outskirts of the city on Sunday. One of the motives behind the murder is learnt to be a questionable case of gang rape which aggravated old enmity.

Jangid, found with several stab injuries, including on the neck, was murdered due to gang rivalry between Rohit Ramteke and Lucky Telang groups active in south Nagpur. The daring kidnapping and murder raises question over the police ‘Operation crackdown Phase II’.

Though Telang is behind bars with MPDA, and Ramteke and his accomplice Chandu Kawde too are in jail on dacoity charges, their group members are now giving cops a tough time.

It’s learnt Ramteke, now booked for gang rape for the second time, had barged into the house of Dattu Fatik, a bootlegger, which led to a case of dacoity against him. Jangid is a nephew of Fatik, who is friends with Telang, whose gang members had been targeting Ramteke.

It’s learnt Fatik and Jangid were close to the rape survivor, who had lodged a complaint of gang rape against Ramteke, Kawde, Akash and Saurabh at Ajni police station with help from a social worker. The rivalry between Ramteke’s gang and that of Telang and Fatik had worsened after the gang rape.

Fatik’s close friend Vicky had thrashed Ingle, who is one of the gang rape accused. Fatik gang’s Tichkule had assaulted Saurabh too. All these developments had aggravated the gang rivalry.

On Saturday, Jangid had gone to attend to attend a funeral at Manewada crematorium. He was summoned outside the crematorium by one of his rivals. As he stepped out, Prasheel Jadhav alias Monu Rider, Lalit Rewatkar and another whisked away Jangid on a scooter after tying his hands. CCTV footage of the kidnappers taking Jangid on a red scooter later helped police crack the case.

It’s learnt Jangid was taken to a room, thrashed and was about to be murdered, when the victim pleaded for forgiveness and promised a substantial amount for his release.

The kidnappers then took Jangid to Umrer and brought him back to his house. But as he could not cough up the promised amount, and also had tried to escape, they fractured his leg and took him to a desolate place near Dunda Maroti, where they stabbed him to death. The kidnappers also sent a message in the locality that they had eliminated Jangid and fled the scene.

Ajni police first found the red scooter on which Jangid was kidnapped, and then Hudkeshwar police tracked down a minor. He named a person, Shivhare, as the one who knew about the body, which police were trying to find.

Crime branch, and Ajni and Hudkeshwar police teams were searching for the body in and around Besa, Beltarodi, Outer Ring Road and adjoining areas, which showed mobile phone locations of the murderers. The body was found after Shivhare and the minor led Hudkeshwar police team to the desolate place.

PATNA: A 13-year-old girl from Katihar , who was kidnapped while returning home from school more than a month ago, was rescued from Siliguri in West Bengal on Monday by her parents with the help of Bihar Police .

“The girl was kidnapped by Lakhman Paswan and his associates in the last week of November while she was returning from her school,” Katihar’s Sahayak police station SHO Rajesh Kumar said, adding, “Paswan took her to Siliguri where he works at a tea manufacturing company and raped her.”

In her police complaint, the girl alleged that she was raped by Paswan, a father of three, in his rented accommodation soon after they landed at Siliguri. When she complained to his wife Munni Devi, she allegedly threatened her and told her to follow her husband’s diktat.

According to the complaint, the minor overheard a conversation between Paswan and his wife about selling the minor to pimp in a red light area. Frightened, she narrated her tale to a sympathetic neighbour.

“The neighbour took pity on her and somehow contacted her parents in Katihar over phone and disclosed about the place where she was held captive,” said an investigating officer, quoting the victim.

Paswan (40) and his wife Muni Devi (35) have been booked under Section 366A of IPC and POCSO Act 2012. “Other sections will be added after receipt of the victim’s medical report,” the SHO added.

Katihar SP Vikas Kumar said, “The girl comes from a poor family and her neighbour took advantage of the family’s economic condition. The couple’s links with those involved in human trafficking in Siliguri are being verified. Our first priority was to get the victim released safe and sound.”

Since the police were made aware that Paswan was trying to sell her off, the Katihar police exerted pressure on his relatives in Katihar. “Going to Siliguri would have taken time so we exerted pressure on Lakshman’s relatives in Katihar to hand over the girl to her parents. And the girl was let off near the ‘hawai adda’ under the Katihar Sahayak police station on Monday evening from where she was brought to the police station,” said a police officer.

“We will now send a police team to Siliguri to trace the place where the girl was kept in illegal confinement and subjected to sexual abuse. A woman police officer has been entrusted with the task of counselling the victim on a regular basis,” the SP said.

The minor was produced at the Katihar civil court on Tuesday and sent to the local sadar hospital for medical examination. The medical report is awaited.

Though the Sahayak SHO denied that any missing complaint was lodged, the girl’s father claimed that he had filed a complaint petition to the local police but nobody cared. “Thane wale bole ki pata lagao (cops asked me to search her myself),” the girl’s father said.

BENGALURU: A 32-year-old north Bengaluru building contractor abducted by seven men allegedly hired by his first wife was rescued in Hassan on Thursday. While four kidnappers have been arrested, three others and the woman are on the run.

According to police, Roma Sheikh, a resident of Marathahalli and first wife of Shahid Sheikh, 32, a resident of Vishweshwaraya Layout on Sidedahalli Main Road, tried in vain to project that the kidnapping had been orchestrated by his second wife .

He married another woman, Rathna Khatum, a year ago and started living with her in Vishweshwaraya Layout. “Roma was angry with Shahid as he started living with Khatum permanently and gave away her jewellery and money to his second wife. So, she hired Abhishek and team to abduct her husband and paid Rs 2 lakh to the gang,” said Shashikumar.

The DCP said Roma wanted to get her husband back and, therefore, she hired the kidnappers, whom she knew.

According to police, the gang executed the plan around 1pm on June 7, when Shahid went to purchase vegetables. Later, they took him to Hassan and kept him captive at Bharath’s farmhouse. The gang had plans to extort money from Khatum.

“The kidnappers got in touch with Khatum and demanded Rs 10 lakh for her husband’s safe release. Finally, they agreed to release him for Rs 2 lakh.

Muzaffarpur SSP Jayant Kant briefs the media on Sunday

PATNA: A 45-year-old chartered accountant (CA) Kishan Kumar Agarwal, who was kidnapped from Siliguri in West Bengal on Tuesday, was rescued from Motipur police station area in Muzaffarpur district late Saturday night. The kidnappers had demanded Rs5 crore as ransom from the victim’s family for his safe release.

The police arrested four kidnappers and recovered Rs47.74 lakh out of the Rs50 lakh they had received as ransom from the family for his release. Eleven mobile phones, one pistol and three live cartridges were also seized from their possession. An SUV in which the CA was being shifted to another safer place after receiving part of the ransom money somewhere in Gopalganj district, was also recovered during vehicle checking on the NH-28 in Muzaffarpur district.

Muzaffarpur SSP Jayant Kant said on Sunday that police swung into action following a tip-off that the abductors were planning to shift the captive to other hideouts. A police team led by City SP P K Mandal was assigned the task to check the vehicles. The police spotted the SUV and rescued the captive. Four persons in the SUV were also nabbed.

During preliminary investigation, the kidnappers revealed that Agarwal was kidnapped from Siliguri. The kidnappers kept on changing their locations and visited Bhagalpur, Gopalganj and Muzaffarpur districts to avoid police action. The ransom was demanded from the victim’s family twice using Agarwal’s mobile phone he was carrying with him at the time of kidnapping, the SSP said.

The kidnappers had contacted the family twice on Tuesday evening and on Wednesday morning and demanded Rs5 crore as ransom. A case was lodged with Siliguri police station after the family failed to trace Agarwal, who had left his home at Punjabi Para in Siliguri on a two-wheeler on Tuesday. While the victim’s family resides at Guru Nanak Sarni (ward number 13), his office is located at Hill Cart Road.

An inspector of Siliguri police, Sudip Chakravorty, who came to Muzaffarpur, said the kidnappers were keeping a close watch on Agarwal’s activities. On Tuesday morning, the kidnappers started following him soon after he returned from a local temple with his wife. He left home on a two-wheeler after receiving a call on his mobile phone. Since then he was traceless and his mobile was switched off.

Chakravorty said they contacted their counterparts in Muzaffarpur after the kidnappers’ location was traced in Gopalganj district. The members of the special cell and the district police were keeping a close surveillance on the movement of the kidnappers.

The arrested kidnappers were identified as Ranjeet Gimire of Siliguri, Robin Orang and Anwar Hussain from Assam and Faiz Ahmad of Gopalganj in Bihar . The police were verifying the arrested kidnappers’ connection with the local criminals, if any. “Raids are underway to arrest the other gang members,” Muzaffarpur City SP incharge Mandal said, adding that raids were also conducted in Gopalganj district.

The victim told TOI that he was kept inside a room with no window. “Sonu had threatened to chop me off into pieces and bury somewhere in the jungle after pouring salt so that none could ever trace me,” he said.

Deepak said Sonu had befriended him two months back at his shop. “After several days, he offered me a job at Bihta and said I can also run my shop. I was required to work for four hours on Rs22,000 monthly remuneration,” he said.

Deepak said one day Sonu took him to a person whom he identified as his manager to win confidence. “On January 7, Sonu asked me accompany him to Fatuha in a SUV. Before getting inside the vehicle, he offered me an aerated drink which was spiked. I woke up disoriented inside a dark room with no window,” he said.

Jakkanpur police station SHO Mukesh Kumar Verma said kidnappers had used Deepak’s cellphone to make the ransom call to his family members due to which police initially had not been able to trace his location. “Deepak’s family members were directed not to leave the spot fixed for ransom delivery while police kept surveillance on them from Friday night. Once kidnappers got assured that there was no policeman, they returned and changed the time for ransom delivery to Saturday morning,” he said.

Verma said then police raided a house at Chorgaon and recovered Deepak. “Sonu told police that he was prepared to kill Deepak. Police suspect he is involved in several criminal cases about which details are being gathered,” he added.

Mahesh Savani

SURAT: Mahesh Savani , a top realtor and owner of many educational institutes in the city, was booked by police at Umra police station for alleged extortion and kidnapping of a builder on Saturday.

The accused, who has attained fame for organizing mass marriages of orphan girls for around a decade, allegedly kidnapped Gautam Patel , 65 , from his house and demanded Rs19 crore for his release.

Police booked Savani, his aide Gopal and four others for extortion and kidnapping under Indian Penal Code on Patel’s complaint. Patel alleged that he was in his house at Parl Point when Gopal and four persons came in a car and asked him to go with them.

Patel refused after which Savani arrived at the spot and forcibly took the complainant in his car to his office in Vesu and demanded Rs19 crore from him. The complainant was also slapped by the accused.

“Savani threatened me that he has contacts at high-level and can put me in trouble if the money was not paid to him. I don’t deny that I had not borrowed money from him but the way he tried to pressurize me is wrong,” said Patel, who recently returned from the US for his son’s marriage.

Patel and his partner Tarun Rawal, a builder who died a few years ago, had borrowed money from Savani in 2009-10. Of the total money borrowed, Patel is supposed to repay Rs3 crore to the accused. “Due to heavy loss in business I couldn’t repay the money in time. Hence I gave 60 per cent share in a plot of land to Savani. He couldn’t recover his money because there is a legal dispute over the land and thus the former is harassing me. I am not running away or denying the unpaid loan,” Patel said.

CCTV footages at the residence of Patel show Savani and other accused taking him along with them. Police will be recovering these footages as a part of their investigation in the case.

Police visited office of Savani where Patel was taken. “The staffers at Savani’s office claim that their recorder was not working properly. We will gather strong evidences before taking action against the accused,” said a police officer at Umra police station.

On Wednesday, SDPO Chatra Varun Rajak said that a case was lodged with the Sadar police station on Monday by a relative of Verma, claiming that the latter has been kidnapped. On Tuesday, a special investigation team found Verma alone in a forest near Unta village on the Itkhori-Chauparan road. A mobile phone and Rs 3,800 have been seized from him, the SDPO added.

A case under section 420 of the Indian Penal Code has been registered against Verma.

BENGALURU: Six days after a newborn boy was abducted from a BBMP maternity hospital in Chamarajpet, parents and doctors are casting aspersions on one another. Police, meanwhile, claim they are on the verge of zeroing on a woman suspected to have taken away the child.

While the child’s mother, Husna Banu, 28, raised doubts over the location of the bed she had been shifted to in the general ward, doctors in the hospital said there was something fishy in the family as the woman had been left without any attender.

Curiously, one doctor in the hospital claimed the woman who fled with the baby had entered the premises claiming to be a doctor herself. “She appears to be know the hospital well and has used a door that is open only on Fridays, to flee with the child,” he added.

Autorickshaw driver and JJR Nagar resident Naveed Pasha brought his wife, Husna, to the hospital near Sirsi Circle on Friday morning. “I delivered a healthy boy at 7.51am and by 11.25am, he was kidnapped,” Husna told TOI on Wednesday.

Two hours after delivery, Husna and the child were taken to the general ward, which had three beds. The ward, however, was empty.

“They shifted me and my child to the last bed. I asked them why they did so but they didn’t have an answer. The ward had a backdoor. I asked the staff where does that door lead to and they told me it was for the cleaning staff. A helper said it was never open.”

Husna was resting with her baby next her, when a woman came and stood beside her. “The woman said I had to take two pills and gave them to me. I thought she was a hospital staffer and took the pills. In seconds, I fell asleep. I recall my bed shaking when the child as lifted. When I woke up, neither the woman nor the baby was around,” Husna narrated.

“I started screaming and noticed that the backdoor was open. I got off the bed and rushed to the reception,” she said. Pasha immediately lodged a complaint with Chamarajpet police.

“Police officials asked me all kinds of dirty questions like if I had sold the child and how much money I had made. Why would I do such a thing,” said Husna.

Planned operation

Dr Nirmala Buggi, BBMP chief health officer (clinical), said it was a well-planned operation and the first such incident in a BBMP maternity hospital. “We have CCTV footage and can see the woman coming and standing next to Husna for nearly 15 minutes, before picking up the child. She fled from the backdoor,” she said.

“Usually, when a child is delivered, the father or some attender sits next to the mother, but there was something very suspicious about this family,” another doctor said, adding that there was no attender with the mother for almost an hour.

“The woman knows this hospital really well because this backdoor is only open on Fridays for the dhobi to enter,” the doctor said. According to CCTV grabs, the woman entered the hospital in an autorickshaw. “We are looking for the baby and are 70% close to resolving this case,” a police official said.

Husna and Pasha have two other children, a boy and a girl, police said.

AHMEDABAD: A man from the Ghodasar area of the city on Wednesday filed a complaint with Anandnagar police alleging that a moneylender kidnapped him from Prahladnagar and illegally confined him, demanding the Rs 3 lakh he had lent the complainant six months ago.

In his FIR, Mitesh Bhavsar, 30, who works for a firm in Satellite and lives at Smruti Darshan Society in Ghodasar, stated that he was introduced to the moneylender, Ishwar Vaghela , a year and a half ago by a common friend named Shekhar Patel.

Bhavsar said he had borrowed Rs 3 lakh from Vaghela and had given him signed cheques. After that, Bhavsar lost his job and has been unemployed for six months.

On Wednesday afternoon, when Bhavsar was home in Ghodasar, he got a call from Patel who told him that Vaghela wanted to meet him at a hotel in Prahladnagar. When Bhavsar went there, Vaghela demanded his money, to which Bhavsar told him he did not have any.

After a few minutes of arguments, Vaghela asked Bhavsar to have tea with him at another place. Unaware of his intentions, Bhavsar sat in his car and Vaghela took him to a vacant flat in the Dudheshwar area.

Vaghela then threatened to confine Bhavsar in the flat until he got his money. The then told Bhavsar to call his relatives and arrange for the money. Bhavsar made the first call to his friend R K Patel , asking for money. Bhavsar’s friend acted wisely and called the police control room. After a while a team of Anandnagar police reached the spot and rescued Bhavsar.

RAJKOT: In a scene reminiscent of eighties’ B-grade pot-boilers, three assailants kidnapped a 30-year-old man , thrashed him brutally and then buried him alive in the sand to avenge their old financial dispute .

However, in a befitting anticlimax, the victim dug himself out with little effort, ran for his life with goons close on his heels, straight into the shelter of the policemen who rescued him.

All this happened near Gondal town of Rajkot district on Sunday night, while cops also rounded up the three accused, identified as Arvind Bambhava, Ravi Vakatar and Chandu Bharwad on Monday.

During preliminary questioning, police found that the sinister plot was a fallout of a financial dispute between Arvind Bambhava and the victim, Kapil Marakana, who works in a dairy on Vora Kotada Road in Gondal.

According to cops, the grudge went back to the days when the dairy named Shivshakti was owned by Bambhava and Markana was his employee for six years. However, Bambhava had to sell off the dairy to one Yogesh Bharwad six months ago, owing to losses. This was the starting of his acrimony towards Markana, whom he accused of embezzling dairy funds and causing losses.

Nursing his grudge, Bambhava, accompanied by Vakatar arrived at the dairy on Sunday evening on the former’s bullet and took Markana away forcibly with them to a sand stockyard on Gondal road owned by Bambhava’s friend, Chandu.

They took Marakana to Bharwad’s cabin and beat him up with bare hands and a lathi. Not satisfied with their revenge, they hauled him out in the open, pinned him on the ground and buried him in the sand with hands and feet tied. They buried him till Markana lay motionless inside the man-made dune, leaving him to die. The trio then retreated to the cabin to toast their success.

“While they inside the cabin, Markana started to wriggle furiously under the sand and first his feet came loose. After some more struggle, he managed to come out and run, but the trio spotted him and started chasing him. But Markana raced ahead of them and reached the nearby Gondal sub-jail where he sought help from a cop deployed there. The trio saw this and beat a hasty retreat,” said AV Jadeja, in-charge inspector with Gondal city police station.

“After being informed by the jail police, we detained the three in the night and are waiting for their Covid-19 reports, after which they will be formally arrested,” said Jadeja.

On February 26, a college-going girl had been found critically injured at Aarey Colony and the young man accompanying her told the police they had had a road accident. Three months later, on May 14, police arrested the man, Ajay Bajpai, for having kidnapped the girl and offering her a spiked beverage. The girl's family, who come from modest means, said the police had been apprised of the facts way back in March but no arrest was made then.

""We were told officers were busy handling the COVID crisis. But we are desperate to know what exactly transpired on the day our daughter was found injured,"" her father told TOI.

The 16-year-old victim studies in a junior college at Andheri. Bajpai, 24, was known to the victim's friend. In early February, the victim said that Bajpai grabbed her hand, after which she slapped him. ""We did not speak to each other since. Then on February 26, he started to apologise and offered a soft drink as a truce,"" the victim said. Shortly, she started feeling giddy and decided to go home. Bajpai offered to drop her on his two-wheeler and wouldnt take no for an answer. ""I passed out sometime after sitting pillion on his motorcycle. When I opened my eyes, I was in a hospital ICCU,"" she said. The victim had suffered fractures to both eye sockets, jaw, nasal bone and roof of her mouth. Her teeth were broken. For 24 hours since the incident, she remained unconscious.

""The police had brought my daughter to the hospital at Jogeshwari. They told me another motorcyclist had rammed into Bajpai's two-wheeler and fled. Bajpai had suffered a minor leg injury,"" the victim's father said. In a statement recorded with the Aarey police, Bajpai said that he and the girl planned to watch a film at a Goregaon mall and had stopped to buy snacks at Aarey just before the accident occurred. ""My daughter was swinging between life and death. Doctors were doubtful if they could save her vision,"" her father said. While in the ICCU, she told hospital staff what had happened outside college. In mid March, the police, who had initially recorded a case of rash driving, now booked Bajpai for kidnapping and drugging her . ""Her hospital documents wrongly recorded her age as 18. Being a minor, far stringent sections under POCSO are applicable against the accused,"" said the victim's lawyer, Sunil Lalla.

After eight days in the Jogeshwari hospital, she was moved to Sion Hospital where she underwent procedures. A month after the incident, she returned home but her appearance had changed drastically. ""Her treatment is far from complete. The police must check the accused's phone records and CCTV footage from the accident spot to find out if our daughter was assaulted. How could Bajpai procure the sedative with such ease? There are several unanswered questions,"" her father said.

KORAPUT: In a daring raid, some miscreants, who identified themselves as policemen, kidnapped a youth from a train. But their effort was short-lived as the police managed to arrest three of the kidnappers within 48 hours while also rescuing the youth on Friday. Three juveniles were also apprehended for their role in the crime.

On Tuesday, 19-year-old Bibhuti Pujari, a resident of Rampur under Subarnapur district, was travelling to Titlagarh. Pujari works in Pune and after reaching Vishakapatnam, he boarded the Dhanbad-Alleppy express train for Titlagarh.

During the course of the journey, five miscreants boarded the train. While scouting for target, they zeroed in on Pujari. To the kidnappers, Pujari’s fair complexion and western Odisha accent may have made him a perfect candidate, said the police, who felt they must have thought he was rich.

Identifiying themselves as policemen, they caught hold of Pujari and accused him of being involved in ganja trade. “Despite Pujari’s denial, they made him alight from the train at Lada railway station,” said SP (Rayagada), Sarvana Vivek M. The incident took place at around 7.30 pm. being a small station, there was hardly any crowd.

There, the five were joined by six more men who took Pujari to a mango orchard on the outskirts of Rayagada town. Once there, they called Pujari’s father and demanded Rs 10 lakh ransom to let him go. They also threatened to kill Pujari if his family failed to pay the ransom or informed the police, the SP said.

But Pujari’s father approached the Rayagada SP and sought his help. Sarvana formed a special team to trace the youth and the kidnappers. During investigation, the police managed to locate the place from the mobile phone that was used to make the ransom call to Pujari’s father. It led them to the hideout on the outskirts of Rayagada. Seeing the police, five of the kidnappers fled. But the police managed to nab six others and also free Pujari.

The police also seized one SUV, an auto-rickshaw, one motorcycle, one gun and two rounds of ammunition, three mobile phones and some sharp-edged weapons. Police said Pujari’s kidnapping seemed random and that the amount could have been decided once they assessed his family’s worth after talking to him.

NEW DELHI: In a bizarre turn of events, a man kidnapped three children and kept them in a room in Haryana to take revenge on Delhi Police. Cops had earlier held him under preventive custody from Sarita Vihar. While the family members were frantically looking for the children, the man called them posing as a police officer. He asked them to reach a police station, and take the children into their custody. He even gave a hint that they should bring bribe money with them.

The family reached the police station, but could not find the children. They accused the cops of corruption. Subsequently, the number from which the accused was making the calls was traced and the children were rescued. The caller was arrested on abduction charges.

A police official said that the accused, Bimal Kumar, used to work as marketing head at an NGO called Anti-Corruption Crime Control Force. The three girls, aged 17, 15 and 11, used to stay with their uncle and aunt at a colony near Sarita Vihar after their parents had died a few years ago. On Thursday, the accused found the siblings at a park and lured them to accompany him so that he could ‘help them get a share of their ancestral property’. He told them that their uncle was trying to usurp that property. The girls did not realise Kumar’s nefarious intention and followed him to a house in Faridabad , where the latter locked them up.

Meanwhile, the family started looking for the children in the locality. Kumar called them from an unknown number and asked them to reach the Kalindi Kunj police station. Soon, they got another call from him. This time he told the family members that a senior officer had sold the children to an NGO. He then asked them to transfer Rs 12,000 immediately to an account number to facilitate the release.

When the call came from one of the kidnapped girls, who claimed that they were left stranded on a road near Badarpur, the family members immediately reached the police station and met the senior officers.

“We registered a case and traced the mobile number from which the calls were made. We managed to nab Bimal on Saturday. Initially, he feigned ignorance about the entire incident, but on sustained interrogation, he confessed to the crime,” said Chinmoy Biswal, DCP, south-east. Kidnapped children were rescued from the house in Faridabad.

During interrogation, Kumar claimed that he had planned the kidnapping to defame Delhi Police for detaining him in a petty case. He even named a few cops who had detained him. He also tried to leverage the situation by forcing the victim’s uncle to write off a part of his property in the name of children, which Kumar planned to usurp later. The mobile phone used by the accused has been recovered.

The matter came to light after Amit’s father, Musafir Rai, somehow managed to escape from the clutches of the abductors and reported the incident to the Jandaha police in Vaishali district on Friday.

Police rescued Amit from Samastipur late on Friday evening. On Saturday, Amit recorded his statement in a court at Hajipur under Section 164 of CrPC. The court later allowed him to go to his native village Naurangpur under the Mahnar police station in Vaishali district.

On Friday, a video of the ‘pakadua vivah’ also went viral on social media. In the video, Amit can be heard crying at the top of his voice for help. However, his cries went on deaf ears.

The video showed a group of youths jostling with Amit and exerting pressure on him to follow the marriage rituals. Even the priest was pressured to complete the process as early as possible.

According to the viral video, the authenticity of which TOI doesn’t confirm, an elderly man, who Amit called ‘chacha’ (uncle), seems to be aware of the whole kidnapping drama. “Had you (chacha) told me about this (marriage), I would have accepted it without demanding any dowry. But the way it is happening is not right,” Amit is heard saying in the video.

SHO of Jandaha police station Ajay Kumar said five people, including Vinod Rai and Nawal Rai, have been made accused in the FIR lodged by the victim’s father, an affluent farmer. “The girl is staying with her family. Further action will be taken on the basis of the court’s directive,” the SHO added.

According to the FIR, five people travelling in an SUV intercepted Amit near the primary health centre at Jandaha, forced him and his father to sit in the moving vehicle and took them to Baruna Rasalpur village under Halai police outpost in Samastiur district for marriage.

‘Pakadua vivah’ is quite common in districts like Vaishali, Samastipur, Begusarai, Lakhisarai, Khagaria, Nawada, Patna and Sheikhpura. Some cases have also been reported from Gaya and Jamui districts. “The disconcerting trend is a matter of concern,” said Sanjay Singh, a social activist.

According to an official data, altogether 4,488 people were abducted in the state for marriage in 2019.

Ravi Ahir in police custody

VADODARA: A young businessman from Bodeli was kidnapped by his friend who demanded ransom of Rs 1 crore for his release! The kidnapper, however, released the friend after being paid Rs 1.5 lakh by the latter’s father, though he got arrested on Saturday for the betrayal.

Accused Ravi Ahir had called Deepak Mistry to meet him on November 14 night. Mistry, a marble and tiles trader, went to meet Ahir along with his friend, Rohit Suthar.

When the duo reached Chandrajyoti Society, Ahir met them here but on the pretext of having some personal work with Mistry, asked Suthar to go back.

After Suthar left, the duo proceeded Vaniyadri canal where two unidentified persons were already waiting for them.

The four then proceeded towards Kosindra village where the two unidentified persons suddenly pushed Mistry from his vehicle.

Ahir then tied Mistry’s hands, while another person sealed his mouth with cellotape.

After switching off Mistry’s phone, Ahir called up Naran Mistry, the trader’s father, from his own mobile phone and asked him to come near Vaniyadri canal with ransom money of Rs 1 crore.

When the father reached Vaniyadri canal with Rs 1.5 lakh, Ahir took the money from him as well as his car and left the place. Later, he picked up Mistry and the other two aides and kept driving on until Mistry’s father called. They dropped Mistry near a closed ginning mill and informed his father about his location.

Mistry was later rescued by his father and his friends and taken to hospital where he also informed the police about the crime.

On Friday, an offence of kidnapping, assault and criminal intimidation was registered at Bodeli police station.

Meanwhile, Ahir abandoned Naran’s car and fled to Surat from where he was nabbed on Saturday.

During interrogation, Ahir confessed to befriending Mistry only because he was rich. “His sole intention of kidnapping Mistry was to get money from his family. We are in search of two other persons who had helped him,” said a police official.

PALAKKAD: The body of a woman was exhumed from the residential compound of her friend at Manali in Palakkad Town on Wednesday.

After arresting the friend, a music teacher, police said they were suspecting that the deceased could be Suchitra, 42, who had been missing from her home at Naduvilakkara, Kottiyam, in Kollam.

The woman, a beautician trainer at a parlour in Pallimukku, Kollam, had been missing since March 17. Police said the woman and the arrested youth, hailing from Kozhikode but residing in Palakkad, had been in a relationship.

Suchitra had reportedly told her employer around 4pm on March 17 that she was going to Alappuzha to nurse her ailing father-in-law. Though she had initially applied for three days’ leave, the next day she later sent an email, requesting an extension for five more days.

The woman, however, told her parents that she was heading to Ernakulam to conduct classes for beautician trainees. When she went incommunicado, her parents lodged a complaint with Kottiyam police on March 20. Police said the woman was divorced. When the probe made no headway, the parents moved a habeas corpus petition in the high court, and received an order for a crime branch probe.

Crime branch sleuths tracked her phone locations and zeroed in on the youth. Investigators located the man on Tuesday, and sealed his house.

During interrogation, the man admitted that they were in a relationship, and added that she had committed suicide after a quarrel. Police said he later confessed to the murder, and led them to the body, buried close to a compound wall. The man also reportedly said that the woman’s insistent demand for living together forced him to eliminate her.

Investigators, however, were yet to believe his version. The body has been sent for a forensic examination to confirm the identity of the deceased.

The man has been married to a woman from Koonampayikkulam in Kollam. He met Suchitra during a visit to his wife’s house.

LAGOS (Nigeria): A soccer player formerly on Nigeria's national team was killed in a car crash and another was kidnapped by gunmen while driving in a separate incident on the same day, their clubs said on Monday.

Ifeanyi George, who played two games for Nigeria in 2017, was killed along with club teammate Emmanuel Ogbu when their car collided with a parked truck in Edo state in southern Nigeria on Sunday.

Their deaths were announced in a statement from their club, Enugu Rangers . George was 26. Ogbu was a member of the club's youth team. A third man who was in the car and who was not a soccer player was also killed.

The Nigerian soccer league was suspended last week because of the coronavirus pandemic and George and the other men were reportedly returning home to Lagos.

Also Sunday, Nigeria striker Dayo Ojo of two-time African club champion Enyimba and a player from a different team were kidnapped by gunmen while traveling by car to the city of Akure in southwestern Nigeria. Enyimba said another of its players escaped from the gunmen.

Ojo played for Nigeria at the 2018 African Nations Championship, when the team made the final.

Kidnappings for ransom are relatively common in Nigeria and soccer players and coaches and their families are often targets. Former Nigeria captain John Obi Mikel and former national team coach Samson Siasia have both had relatives kidnapped. Siasia's mother was kidnapped and later released last year. Mikel's father has been kidnapped twice, the latest time while his son was playing for Nigeria at the 2018 World Cup.

PATNA: A team of Chhattisgarh police, which camped in Bihar for five days, failed to rescue industrialist Praveen Somani, who was kidnapped for a ransom of Rs 6.5 crore from Raipur district on January 8. The team, led by Raipur SSP Sheikh Arif Hussain, has now shifted its focus to some districts in Uttar Pradesh which share border with Bihar.

Police sources said at least two interstate criminal gangs with roots in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh were involved in Somani’s kidnapping.

According to police sources, notorious Chandan Sonar is suspected to be mastermind behind Somani’s kidnapping. It was Sonar who had kidnapped Gujarat-based garment industrialist Sohail Hingora from Daman in October 2013 and kept him captive in Bihar’s Saran until around Rs 10 crore was paid to him as ransom.

Somani owns iron and steel manufacturing units in Chhattisgarh’s Raipur district. Sources said the industrialist was brought to Jamshedpur from where he was shifted to Ranchi and then to Gaya.

“Chattishgarh police team has so far conducted raids in Patna, Nalanda and Vaishali districts and quizzed several suspects having links with Sonar,” sources said.

Bihar STF SP Sudhir Kumar Podika refused to divulge details of the operation, saying it would hamper investigations. He, however, said the Chattisgarh police team has shifted its focus from Bihar to Uttar Pradesh now.

NEW DELHI: When his sister’s engagement broke off due to their financial condition, an 18-year-old planned a sensational kidnapping bid with his mother and sister. The family decided to target their neighbour, who runs an automobile business, and kidnapped his three-year-old son in Bawana.

DCP (outer-north) Gaurav Sharma said that the child’s father reported that his son was missing on Sunday afternoon around 1pm.

Initially, the police teams searched around for the boy at railway stations, bus stands and other public places. However, no clue was found. The teams even checked the nearby drains fearing that the child may have fallen in them.

While scanning CCTV footage around the house, the teams noticed a Tata Ace that was leaving from the area. It was later found that the vehicle belongs to one Dhruv , who lives in the vicinity, but was shifting his household items to a new place he had rented for his family.

The 18-year-old was taken in for questioning, where he initially feigned ignorance, but later confessed to kidnapping the boy with the help of his mother and sister. Examination of his phone revealed the plan.

Police said that the youth’s phone contained photographs of the child and numerous calls that were made to the child’s father, which had gone unanswered. The police also seized three audio recordings from the phone. These recordings, which were meant to be sent to the child’s father, were about demanding ransom, where he had asked for Rs 75 lakh for releasing the child.

Based on the information provided by the youth, the police teams reached Daryapur. There, the youth’s mother and sister were found and upon searching the house, the child was found hidden beneath a heap of clothes with his mouth taped and hands tied.

Dhruv told cops that he hatched the plan after his sister’s engagement broke off. He added that he was also forced to leave his studies after the death of his father last year.

On the other hand, the kidnapped boy did not seem to be in fear or aggrieved after being released, which is leading to the suspicion that the boy was familiar with the kidnappers.

Speaking to TOI, East Godavari SP, Nayeem Asmi said that the kidnappers might have released the boy in fear of the police and maintained that the hunt to nab the kidnappers will go on.

Talking about the rumours, Asmi said that they will investigate into them as the area is known for being a hub of cricket betting.

On being asked if the father of the kidnapped boy had paid a ransom to the kidnappers, the SP said that Venkata Ramana did not go out of his house since the day his boy was kidnapped and his phone had been placed under surveillance. When asked why the boy was exhibiting no sign of fear or trauma after being released, Asmi said that he too had been surprised at the boy’s disposition and felt that he was behaving this way because the boy is smart and courageous.

Jasith, on the other had said that one of the kidnappers was a man called Raja who treated him well and fed him idly every day.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Even as people are worried over stories of kidnap attempts on little children , such a bid was reported in the state capital on Friday. The attempt was made on a one-year-old son of a deaf and mute couple residing at Thamalam under Karamana police stations .

Geetha, the mother of the child, said two men entered their residence by jumping over the periphery wall of the house and tried to kidnap the child, who was playing in the bedroom. However, while they were trying to escape through the same route, Geetha, who came out of the bathroom, confronted them. The men threatened her at knifepoint and escaped leaving the child behind. They also threw chilli powder at her face.

Geetha is the wife of Manoj, who works in a restaurant in a mall here. The couple has two sons. It was the younger son who faced the kidnap attempt. The family lived with Manoj’s father, Mohan, who is also deaf and mute.

The house that the family resided shared its rear periphery wall with a large plot where the crematorium of Konkani community in the city functioned. Geetha told the police that the two men came via the crematorium. She was in the bathroom then. The bathroom was also located behind the house, attached to the same compound wall which the kidnappers scaled.

After attacking her with the chilli powder, they escaped through the same route.

“The incident happened around 4pm. When she came to us, it was around 4.30pm. She was still under panic. There was chilli powder on her body as well as on the child,’’ said Ashok Kumar, her neighbour.

After she described to them what happened, Kumar contacted the city police control room. The police reached the spot and launched a search for the suspects. The local residents and the trade union workers at the junction nearby too joined the search.

A day ago, a similar kidnap attempt was reported at Karunagappally in Kollam in which the police detained a wandering woman. Two weeks ago, a 15-year-old boy from Karamana police station limits had gone missing and ended up dead in a river nearby with no clothes on. The police are yet to solve the mystery behind that death.

AGRA: A three-year-old boy was allegedly kidnapped and strangled by his neighbour as he suspected that the child’s parents were responsible for the breakup of his daughter’s engagement.

According to police, the incident took place at Hathras’s Nagla Heeralal village on Thursday night. The child’s body was found in a box under a bed in the neighbour’s house with a stole tied around his neck. An autopsy report confirmed death by strangulation.

Though the accused Mohan Singh’s wife and daughter, Chandravati and Chandni, have been arrested, he and his two sons, Narayan Singh and Sundeep Singh, are absconding.

A case under Sections 302 ( murder ) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence) of the IPC was registered against five members of Mohan’s family at Sadabad police station, SP Siddharth Shankar Meena said. He said further investigations were on in the matter.

According to a complaint filed by the victim’s father, Navin Kumar, who works in the Indian Navy, the boy — Kunj — was playing outside his home around 3 pm when he disappeared. “We searched for him everywhere but could not locate him. We informed the police around 6pm,” Navin said. He told TOI that someone known to him had seen Kunj with Chandni last.

With the help of police, the family entered Mohan Singh’s house and started searching for Kunj. They finally located him inside a box. Soon after, they rushed the child to a hospital where the doctors declared him brought dead.

MUMBAI: Five men who failed to get bail for four-and-a-half years for kidnapping a teen from Dharavi in 2014 were sentenced to life imprisonment by the sessions court on Friday. Irfan Khan Kureshi (46), Iliyas Khan (44), Wahid Jogi (30), Azad Mevu Khan (29) and Kasam Mevu Khan (29), from Haryana, were nabbed by a Mumbai crime branch team when they arrived in Rajasthan to collect Rs 5 lakh ransom money from the victim Pravin Gupta’s elder brother Pankaj, who was 19 then.

The investigating team submitted 315-page charge-sheet and 14 witnesses were provided police security so that they do not turn hostile. Deputy commissioner of police (crime branch) Dilip Sawant said it was a big achievement as many factors helped get the conviction in the shortest time. Senior inspector Ashok Khot (crime branch unit V) supervised the case and attended all court hearings, said Sawant.

Pankaj, a shoe shop salesman, got a call from Rahul from Haryana on July 22, 2014, stating that they were looking for a salesman to sell gold in Mumbai, for which he would be paid a good salary and high commission. Pankaj received another call on July 25, asking for someone who can help grow their gold business. Pankaj sent his brother to Faridabad, where the gang kidnapped him on August 6.

A case was registered on August 6, 2018, with Shahu Nagar police station after Pankaj received the call demanding Rs 5 lakh, failing which his brother’s life would be in danger. ACP Netaji Bopale supervised a team of inspector Sadanand Rane, assistant inspector Sampatrao Raut, sub-inspector Mahesh Bandgar and constable Prashant Vengulekar, and nabbed the accused on August 9, 2018 from Bharatpur.

Khot said initially the accused were not ready to show the victim and sent two men on a bike to collect the money. When Pankaj did not agree to give the money, three other men came in car with the victim, when the five were caught.

The accused have been booked under Indian Penal Code sections 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy), 342 (wrongful restraint), 364 (A) (kidnapping for ransom) and 387 (putting person in fear of death or of grievous hurt, to commit extortion).

IPS officer-turned-lawyer Y P Singh said kidnapping with ransom was a serious offence and the conviction was a positive approach.

In November 2015, Khan posed as Rahul Jain and lured Hemant Parikh, who runs a copper trading shop at V P Road in Mumbai, through WhatsApp, saying he wanted to sell about seven tonnes of copper for only Rs3.50 a kg. A man picked up Parikh in a car at Delhi airport, and after three km, four men barged in and took him hostage. They took him to an isolated village near Bharatpur, which is near Mathura in UP, took all his belongings.

They withdrew Rs90,000 and got his family to transfer Rs 10 lakh to a bank account.

Sakib helped police trace all other accused, said investigating officer Sachin Kadam.

SURAT: Nani Daman police booked two persons with regard to allegedly kidnapping a general secretary of a students’ union of the Government College Daman (GCD) at Bheslor on Wednesday. The leader was abducted for a dispute over college election scheduled on Friday.

The kidnapped victim could not reach college in time to file nomination forms of a few candidates for class representatives and ladies representative candidates of Akhil Bhartiya Vidhyarthi Parishad (ABVP).

ABVP members alleged that Shivam Patel, who is contesting for GS in GCD, and is the nephew of Daman BJP MP Lalu Patel has orchestrated the kidnap to ensure his win. When contacted Patel refuted the claims and demanded that inquiry should be done on the ABVP leaders’ allegations.

Police booked Manish Patel, Rinkesh Maisuriya, both residents of Kachigam in Daman and two unidentified persons for allegedly kidnapping Vishal Naik, 21, ABVP’s election incharge of GCD.

The accused came in a car and stopped Naik, who was riding a motorcycle. They abused him and forcibly kidnapped him in the car at around 11.30 am and kept moving around in the car before releasing him at around 12.30 noon.

The accused were booked under various sections of Indian Penal Code (IPC) including 342 (wrongful confinement), 365 (kidnapping) among others. Police are yet to make any arrest in the case.

“We have identified the accused and are investigating the case to nab them,” said an officer at Nani Daman police station.

GCD had fixed time for filing of forms for CR and LR from 10 am to 12 noon when ABVP leaders sent Naik to get some photocopies for the form filing. Naik was returning with the photocopies when he was allegedly kidnapped and released only after the form submission time was over.

Election of students council in all colleges affiliated to Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (VNSGU) are scheduled on Friday.

“ABVP has announced Kavita Patel as its GS candidate while MP Lalu Patel wanted his nephew Shivam to become the GS. The MP and his family members have threatened us even in the past to allow Shivam to win or to declare him as ABVP’s candidate,” alleged state joint secretary of ABVP, Yuti Gajre.

“Me or my family is not involved in this issue. Shivam is my relative but I did not get involved in the issue and I will take legal actions against the ABVP leaders for making false allegations against me. I have nothing to do with the kidnapping,” Lalu Patel told TOI.

BHOPAL: A 15-year-old mentally challenged girl, who can’t speak properly, was allegedly kidnapped from near her home on May 3, gangraped, and dumped in another end of the city. Unable to make herself understood or find her way home, she roamed the streets helplessly until police rescued her the next night.

They thought she was only a lost child until she told counsellors through gestures that she had been raped. Her family hadn’t bothered to report her missing because she “has a habit of wandering off ”.

Investigating officer SI Anjana Dhurvey said the child had dropped out of school after class 5, doesn’t speak anything beyond ‘Papa’, ‘Mummy’ and ‘Dadi’, and does not know proper sign language, either.

On the morning of May 3, she walked out of her house and didn’t return. Her family thought she was roaming in the area and didn’t inform police.

Unknown to them, she was kidnapped by two men on a motorcycle and gangraped.

It’s not known how long she was in their captivity, but on the night of May 4, a police patrol spotted her on a street in Piplani , said SI Dhurvey. They took her to the police station and handed her to Gauravi (one-stop crisis centre) the next morning.

When counsellors communicated with the child, they realized with a shock that she was describing rape. There were injury marks on her body which suggested sexual assault.

Piplani police registered a zero FIR and transferred the case to her local police station. SI Dhurvey said that when the child was taken home and police spoke to her mother, she said that the girl had described similar things during an earlier runaway episode.

Police are arranging for an interpreter to communicate with the child, and are scanning CCTV footage to see if they can identify any suspects.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

The was held on March 16 in which Sneha, wife of former village head Ranjitsingh Chavan, defeated Javed Shaikh of the Congress party by a wafer thin margin of two votes.

Chavan was so desperate to get Sneha elected as deputy sarpanch that he scripted a reel life kidnapping drama and allegedly abducted two village panchayat members, Shakeel Anwar Shaikh and Vinod Parte, from different places and forced them to stay at a lodge at Mouda without mobile phones till the election result was announced.

Chavan was helped by his accomplices, brother Abhijeet , Shubham Dixit and Dilip Barde.

Sneha contested the election as an independent candidate and emerged victorious against Javed, who was supported by Shakeel Shaikh and his group.

The post was lying vacant after the resignation of former deputy village headwoman Varsha Tayade.

Narrating the chain of events, Shaikh, cousin of Javed, said he was about to leave for voting when Chavan, his brother Abhijeet and others came in a car to his saloon at Mankapur Chowk and asked to be with them for a meeting with Parte at his liquor bar on the ring road.

Shaikh said, “I did not oppose Chavan. After picking up Parte, we were told that there would be a meeting with the current sarpanch Lalla Bhai . Meanwhile, Chavan left us near powergrid and Shubham Dixit joined.”

Shaikh said, “My and Parte’s mobile phones were snatched. We were taken to a lodge at Mouda and locked up. There was no other way to contact others to seek help. Abhijeet also started threatening with knife which scared us.”

Shaikh and Parte were released at 5pm on March 17 after the result was declared. “We were threatened of dire consequences if we reported the matter to police. However, we gathered courage and lodged a police complaint,” he said.

He also said the sarpanch will now lodge a complaint with the authorities concerned to cancel the election.

Mankapur police have registered an offence of kidnapping against Chavan brothers, Dixit and Barde. Police have so far arrested Barde and launched a search to nab the other accused.

PUNE: The Hadapsar police on Sunday arrested four young men on the charges of kidnapping, disrobing and attempting to murder a 15-year-old boy in the Gopalpatti area of Manjari, after a video clip of the incident went viral on the social media the night before.

The police are searching for two other accomplices involved in the crime.

Police said the teenager, who is undergoing treatment in the intensive care unit of the Sassoon General Hospital, had an argument with the suspects a few days ago and the latter decided to settle score with him. Medical authorities reported to the police the victim’s condition as in a state of unconsciousness. The boy is a school dropout belonging to a poor family, the police added.

The police identified the arrested suspects as Vinit Suryakant Biradar (19) of Phursungi, Shubham Rajabhau Jadhav (19) of Nigdi, Devidas Ghanashyam Pavhane (21) of Hadapsar and Bharat Vishal Rathod (21) of Manjari. All of them have previous record of body offences, the police said.

On Thursday night, the victim’s mother (age 49 years) had lodged a missing person’s complaint after her son, who had left home for watching a Shiv Jayanti procession in the evening, did not return. The police were searching for him when they came across the video clip and later traced the injured boy to the Sassoon hospital .

The video clip showed five to six men assaulting the boy with sharp weapons and leather belts, after disrobing him. The video clip helped the police establish the identity of the assailants.

They videographed the entire act, the police said, adding that some local residents found the boy motionless near the tracks and shifted him to the Sassoon hospital.

The police said the suspects had shared the video clips among themselves using a mobile phone-based internet messaging service. Some of them even sent these clips to their friends and others. Soon, the video clip went viral.

Senior inspector Ramesh Sathe of the Hadapsar police told TOI, “One of our policemen received the video clips on his cellphone.

JAIPUR: Three persons arrested for kidnapping a businessman for ransom, were on Friday sent to police custody till March 17. The three accused had abducted the diamond merchant Prakash Chopra from Bajaj Nagar police station area on March 11 and the cops found him 12 hours after the investigation was initiated.

The accused were identified as Vikram Gujjar, Rakesh Gujjar and Harish Singh. The victim’s son had lodged a complaint at the local police station that Vikram, who managed a PG hostel owned by his father, had called him on Wednesday afternoon to come to the hostel. Chopra went there but did not return home. The same evening, his wife received a phone call from the victim’s mobile number claiming that Chopra had been abducted and if a ransom of Rs 5 crore was not given, then the accused would bury him alive.

“Seeing the gravity of the situation, we immediately constituted teams and started the investigation. Based on the complaint, we started looking for Vikram and found him. Initially, he denied any knowledge about the abducted, but finally admitted to the crime,” said a police official.

Vikram managed the PG hostel with his cousin Rakesh. The two hailed from Sikar and decided to make quick money by kidnapping their employer. They also roped in Harish and called him from Sikar to Jaipur on March 5. They had been planning the crime for nearly a month.

Elaborating further, the official added, “After questioning Vikram through cyber intelligence, we found the other accused as well. The three accused after kidnapping Chopra had taken him to an isolated location in Shivdaspura following which they took him towards Sikar. Due to the fear of being caught, they left him in the forest area of Nechwa in Sikar. They left him there with his hands and feet tied as well as mouth taped. The teams managed to rescue Chopra within 12 hours of abduction and arrest all three behind the crime.”

According to officials, the accused did not have any significant criminal records and were looking to become rich overnight. Police are interrogating them further and also found the vehicle in which the victim was taken to Sikar after abduction.

Tirupur: A 19-year-old woman was detained on Tuesday for kidnapping a three-year-old girl from Palladam taluk last Friday (January 24).

While police have rescued the girl, it is not known whether she was handed over to her father or grandfather, with whom she was staying.

According to a police officer attached to Palladam police station, the woman, identified as Anitha, of Omalur in Salem district, was caught in Erode. “After kidnapping the child, she went to Velankanni shrine in Nagapattinam district. On Tuesday, she came to Erode bus terminus with the child. Police there subsequently took her into custody and alerted us.”

Preliminary inquiry revealed that the woman was deserted by her husband. “She used to roam around many places. The girl’s grandfather found her in Palani on last Thursday when he went to the Dhandayuthapani Swamy temple and took her home for availing sexual services,” the officer said.

According to her, the officer said, the girl’s grandfather told her that he and his son were struggling to raise the girl child since her mother left her. “So, she decided to raise the child and took her away when he fell asleep on January 25,” the officer said.

The Palladam police had earlier registered a kidnapping case against the woman and formed three special teams to nab her based on a complaint lodged by the girl’s father and grandfather.

“We had distributed notices with the details of missing child to police stations across the state. Erode police spotted the accused with the child and caught them. They were then handed over to us. The woman is likely to be arrested on Wednesday,” the officer said.

PATNA: A veterinary compounder Raju Rai (28) along with his parents were feared to be killed after being kidnapped from their rented accommodation at Patthar Ghat under Malsalami police station area in Patna City at around midnight on Friday.

Police had fished out a body, suspected to be of Raju, from river Ganga on Saturday afternoon while his parents were still traceless.

City SP (east) Jitendra Kumar said police stations ahead of Malsalami with riverbank in jurisdiction had been alerted to keep eyes on bodies in river.

“We are looking for bodies. However it was yet not sure if parents had been also killed or not. But yes they were still traceless,” SP said

Kumar said prime reason behind incident is suspected either to be personal enmity of Raju and his family with a neighbour Vijay Rai or affair with his daughter.

SP said police came to know from local residents that Raju was having an affair with Vijay’s daughter since childhood.

“The family is actually a native of Raghopur in Vaishali where Raju works as a veterinary compounder. He had reached Malsalami on Friday night only when Vijay and at least ten others thrashed the trio after dragging them out of residence and took them towards riverbank,” he said.

The SP said blood stains were found on ground near Raju’s residence by police when it reached spot at midnight after getting information about kidnapping.

SP said one of Raju’s friend was with him when they got thrashed but he managed to escape even after getting injured.

""While some said body fished out from river was of Raju others said it was not. We are waiting for family members to reach Malsalami from Raghopur after which FIR would be lodged as well as procedure for body identification would be taken up,” he added.

NEW DELHI: Trusting an unknown woman caller who posed herself as a watch seller proved dear to a 39-year-old executive of a watch firm. The woman via a phone call offered him to check samples of new watches. A meeting was scheduled for him to see the designs of new watches. But he had little idea that it will all later turn out to be a kidnapping trap .

The incident came to fore on Tuesday when the victim, Mukesh, got admitted in a private hospital after being thrashed and gagged by the robbers. Mukesh, who works with a watch manufacturing firm, told cops that he was getting phone calls from an unknown number for the past few days. The woman caller introduced herself as a potential client, who had some new designs of watches to offer.

“On Monday, Mukesh again got a phone call, and he finally decided to meet the woman. He was given an address near Rohini’s Sector-24. When he reached there, the woman was waiting for her. She took the victim to a flat where she said that watches were kept.

However, upon reaching the flat, Mukesh was pinned down by three men. Before he could understand what was happening, the men snatched his phone and shoved him into a room,” said a police officer.

“They started thrashing me and demanded that I arrange Rs 30 lakh immediately. When I told them that I did not have so much money, they asked me to call my friends and ask them for money for my release,” said Mukesh. They continued to thrash him and even smashed his phone.

When the victim told his captors that his friend’s contact number was saved in the phone itself, they thrashed him further. Irked by not being able to get anything from the executive, the men tied him up to a chair and gagged him. They then left the place.

After an hour-long effort, Mukesh was able to free himself. He came out of the flat in an injured condition, and drove out to a busy road. There, he took help of a passerby and called his friend. He was subsequently shifted to a hospital where the cops were alerted about the incident.

Based on the victim’s statement, a case was registered under sections of extortion, causing hurt and wrongful confinement against the men and the woman. Investigating teams are now trying to trace the number which was used by the woman. Efforts are also on to get details about the owner of the flat where the victim was kept confined by the gang.

PATNA: Crime and policing go hand in hand in the state these days. This seems true if the arrest of three police constables from Vaishali district on Sunday in connection with a kidnapping case is taken into account.

Anil Kumar Manjhi, Anil Kumar Pandey and Himanshu Raj — all constables, who patrolled different lanes and bylanes of the district headquarters town in Hajipur, were arrested for their involvement in the kidnapping of one Shivpujan Singh on January 29.

Besides, the three cops, a home guard jawan, Monu Kumar, and three criminals were also arrested. After Shivpujan’s kidnappers demanded Rs 1 lakh as ransom from his family, his wife, Khushboo Kumari, lodged a case with the Hajipur sadar police station on January 29.

Vaishali SP Gaurav Mangla said, “We not only rescued the captive from the clutches of his kidnappers, but also exposed the police-criminal nexus. We recovered the service revolver of constable, Manjhi, from the house of one of the kidnappers, Sujeet Kumar alias Santu, in Katra locality under the Hajipur town police station area.”

The SP added, “The three erring cops were immediately put under suspension and departmental proceedings initiated against them while the contract of service of arrested home guard jawan was terminated.”

The arrested cops’ accomplices were identified as Neeraj Kumar, Amit Kumar and Sujeet Kumar, all residents of Vaishali district. While Manjhi and Pandey belong to Saran district, Raj is a native of Bhojpur district.

If sources are to be believed this is not an isolated case. Police personnel have been accused of kidnapping people and plotting the murder of someone or bank robberies on earlier occasions.

Constable Sanjeev Singh alias Pappu Singh of Saran district, for instance, was arrested on the charges of hatching the conspiracy of at least 12 robberies in banks. He was also involved in the loot of Rs 1.25 crore from a cash van in Saran district in 2013 and dismissed from service. He was earlier deputed as the bodyguard of a DSP-rank officer at Biharsharif in Nalanda district.

Similarly, Amresh Sharma, a constable posted in Begusarai district, was arrested and sent to jail on the charges of plotting the murder of a woman, Sarita Devi, and and her daughter, Monika, at a village in Jehanabad district in 2015.

The discerning trend has, however, embarrassed the top police officials. Additional director general of police (headquarters) Jitendra Kumar said, “Every department has some black sheep and ours is no exception. What is important is that they are getting punished for the offence.”

Bihar Police Association (BPA) president Mritunjay Kumar Singh also admitted that some men in uniform were involved in unlawful activities. “But it does not mean that the entire department is to be blamed and castigated,” he added.

Nigdi

Three minors faked theiron Friday — as they feared a reprimand from their families — after bunking their tuitions and gallivanting throughout the city. Initially, they told their parents that three unknown people had abducted them, only to abandon them after three hours. In a state of panic, the parents approached the cops, who then scrutinised closedcircuit television (CCTV) footage of locations that were narrated by the three minors. With no result at hand, the cops turned suspicious by the minute. It was only after interrogating the children that they could crack the case.The incident came to light around 8.30 pm. The three students aged 13-14 had bunked their classes and went about the city. After sunset, when they perhaps realised that it was too late to go home and that they may get yelled at, they hatched a plan totheir kidnapping. From an unknown number they called their parents and claimed that they were abducted and were finally dropped at Tilak Chowk in. When they were picked from the spot by their parents, they went to Chikhali police as the case fell under the jurisdiction of Rupinagar police chowky.One of the parents told the cops that their kid went to tuition around 5.30 pm on Friday. He had told them that an unknown person came in a car and kidnapped him along with two girls. At 9.30, he had called his parents, saying that three unknown people had abducted him now dropped him back. The minor then requested the parents to pick him up. Based on these statements, the cops began an investigation. They checked the CCTV footage of the spots mentioned by the 13-year-old. However, they could not find a specific car at the locations.Sub-inspector Yogesh Shinde told Mirror, “We reached the spot as soon as we received the information and also scanned the CCTV footage. We did not find any kidnapping-related activity. So, we enquired with locals, who said that they were unaware of the case.”When they could not connect any points, the cops turned towards the children to ask them more questions. “There was something odd about their behaviour. They were not scared and instead behaved normally as if nothing had happened. This stoked our suspicion. When we interrogated them, one of the girls revealed that they had faked their kidnapping,” Shinde added.He said that the children confessed to making the plan since they were scared of going home that late after they had bunked their tuition, which they attend together. Now, the police are counselling the children, where they are told the importance of education and career. They were even told about the gravity of kidnapping — the consequences if it had happened for real. “They regret what they have done and have said that it would not happen again,” the cop said."

CHENNAI: Scanning footage from as many as 150 CCTV cameras from Besant Nagar to Jafferkhanpet, police on Saturday rescued an eight-month-old girl, less than 36 hours after she was kidnapped from her mother's side on the Elliot's beach, and arrested five people including a juvenile. While K Manikandan, 26, of Jafferkhanpet, A Thirupathi Ammal, 42, of Saidapet, and S Mary, 35, and her son S Ruben, 19, of Saidapet were sent to jail, the minor, daughter of Thirupathiammal, was admitted to the correctional facility in Kelly's.

Police said Manikandan's elder sister Pandi Meena, who worked as a maid, didn't have children and was desperate for one. Through a common friend she came to know of Thirupathiammal, who allegedly made a living as a surrogate mother, and Mary. Pandi Meena then told Manikandan, 26, who offered the two women 2 lakh for a child, an officer said.

After trying to get some narikurava women in Besant Nagar to sell a baby, Mary and Thirupathiammal decided to steal one when the women refused, he added.

On Thursday night, Mary, Ruben, Thirupathiammal and her daughter went to the Elliot's beach. Around 2am on Friday, they went to the skating rink. One woman sat close to Rajeshwari and her mother Sneha, narikuravas from Kumbakonam. Around 4am, Selvi woke up and found her daughter missing. She rushed to the nearest police station with her niece. A case was registered but police found no CCTV camera at the spot. About 100 metres away, a camera caught four people including two women boarding an autorickshaw.

Police questioned an auto driver who confirmed the four had boarded his vehicle and that one woman carried a child. Police checked footage from CCTV cameras at Chinnamalai near Saidapet and at Jafferkhanpet. One showed the gang handing over the child to Manikandan, a second showed him walking home with the girl and a third had him handing her over to Pandi Meena.

On Saturday afternoon, a police team landed at Manikandan's house and later rescued the girl from Pandi Meena's house. She was reunited with her parents in the evening.

Adyar assistant commissioner Vinoth Shantharam who formed the special team and its members sub-inspectors Jai Ganesh and Karthikeyan and constables Thirumurugan, Pushparaj, Damodharan, Senthilkumar, Venkateshwaran and Vinod won praise from commissioner A K Viswanathan.

ALLAHABAD: Special Task Force (STF) arrested a man for allegedly abducting a woman and brutally murdering her on Monday, four years after her half-burnt body was found on Kaushambi-Varanasi highway.

The accused Salman (26) was arrested in Daraganj along with an accomplice Lucky Panda alias Lucky (27), while planning to escape from the city. Police also seized two SUVs, a motorcycle, three mobile phones and Rs 2,450 cash from their possession.

During interrogation, Salman told the police that he and the deceased Rachna Shukla had become close friends in 2015 and he had also gifted her a scooty. “As the two-wheeler was registered under my name, she had been insisting to get it registered under her name,” the accused told the police.

The dispute escalated leading to a fight between the two. A few days later, her family lodged a case against Salman at Daraganj police station. Salman alleged that Rachna, who was 19 then, often used to insult him at public places, said police. Fed up of Rachna’s behaviour, Salman decided to kill her. He claimed that Salman and his aides slit Rachna’s throat, disposed her body on the highway and fled.

Additional SP (STF) Neeraj Kumar Pandey said, “Rachna Shukla was allegedly abducted on April 16, 2016 from Daraganj. After she disappeared, her mother Uma Shukla had lodged a case under section 363 and 366 of the IPC against Salman and his accomplices.”

When police failed to get clues about the missing girl, the mother had also filed a petition in Allahabad high court . While working on the case, the STF team came to know that the accused had killed Rachna and thrown her body on the same day (April 16, 2016). They set the body afire at a location close to the Allahabad-Pratapgarh border.

On April 17, 2016, Pratapgarh police recovered a woman’s half-burnt body on the Kaushambi-Varanasi highway and registered a case under section 302 and 201 of IPC against unidentified persons.

On Monday, STF received a tip-off that the prime accused Salman and one of his accomplice were spotted near the Nagbasuki Temple Road. The team cordoned off the area and arrested Salman and Lucky from Daraganj.

COIMBATORE: The city police on Thursday arrested six members of a gang that kidnapped a Ganapathy-based moneylender, his friend and his car driver on Tuesday.

Police identified the moneylender as 65-year-old V Gunasekaran of Balaji Layout in Ganapathy, who was also engaged in the real estate business.

“R Aathi Ganeshan, 44, of Sivananda Colony had contacted him offering to sell an agriculture land. He told Gunasekaran that J Sathya, 27, of Thanjavur would contact him. Sathya visited Gunasekaran’s house on Tuesday around 10.30am and told him that she would take him to the land. Gunasekaran, his friend Johnson and his car driver Ragupathy left for place in a car, accompanied by Sathya. When the car reached Saravanampatti, Sathya asked Ragupathy to stop the vehicle to pick up some friends. Five people, who got into the car, threatened Gunasekaran, Johnson and Ragupathy at knifepoint and kidnapped them. They were kept in a farm house at Gudimangalam near Udumalpet,” a police officer said.

The gang demanded Rs 10lakh ransom for the trio. Gunasekaran’s family and friends deposited Rs 1lakh in the bank account of the gang members.

MUMBAI: Over a year after he was given death sentence by a trial court, the Bombay HC on Wednesday acquitted a 27-year-old man and a co-convict in a 2012 kidnap-murder of a businessman’s 12-year-old son in the city. “We find that the prosecution has failed to bring home the guilt” of Imtiyaz Shaikh (27) and Azad Ansari (28), the HC said.The duo had been charged with luring the Class 5 boy on May 27, 2012 while his father was away on a trip, seeking a Rs25 lakh ransom and dumping his body in a manhole. They were allegedly employed in a fabric embroidery unit at Dharavi owned by his father, Rajesh Bhadange .The high court cited lack of evidence in establishing that ransom calls were made by the duo or that Shaikh led police to the body. There were also no eyewitnesses, the HC bench said.The child’s life was allegedly snuffed by suffocating him and his ribs were found fractured when his body was recovered. The father had initially filed a missing complaint with Shahu Nagar police station.A sessions court had on May 23, 2018 held them guilty and sentenced Shaikh to the gallows and Ansari to life imprisonment.The HC bench of Justices B P Dharmadhikari and Swapna Joshi didn’t accept the ‘last seen’ theory of the prosecutor J P Yagnik and observed that it was propounded only after arrest of the accused. The case was one of circumstantial evidence, Shaikh’s lawyer Ravi Dwivedi and Ansari’s advocate Fakruddin Khan argued. The circumstances are required to link together into a chain in a manner that points only to the accused and no one else. In this case, the chain had chinks, held the court.The state can and may decide to appeal the HC ruling before the Supreme Court. It has two months to appeal. Yagnik said later “a decision will be taken after reading the entire judgment.”Both the accused, in jail since June 2012, are to be released from prison now. Shaikh was taken to Nashik prison after conviction, Ansari was in Arthur Road jail in Mumbai.Police had said the mobile phone used to make ransom calls and SIM cards were recovered from Shaikh and call data records showed a total of four accused to be constantly in touch.The sessions court judge had last May acquitted two other accused—Israr Shaikh, 25, and A Ahmed, 44—for lack of evidence. Another accused, arrested in 2012, was declared a juvenile in 2018 and his trial directed to be separately conducted before a Juvenile Justice Board.Shaikh’s counsel Dwivedi pointed out discrepancies in the prosecution case and the doubts that remained. He also questioned the time of Shaikh’s arrest and the alleged recovery of three handsets and 10 SIM cards from him. He said the SIM cards were never tested by police, nor was it established that Shaikh had made ransom calls from his number. Police had submitted call data records (CDR) on calls received by the businessman.“The ‘last seen’ by itself cannot constitute the valid ground here,” said the HC. “Even if we assume the prosecution story to be correct, the deceased boy was last seen by a witness with juvenile accused and Shaikh. Thus Ansari was not with them.”The HC held that the CDR doesn’t disclose the conversation between the accused, nor does it show phone numbers. The prosecution had only relied on IMIE numbers of allegedly recovered handsets.The prosecution had said Shaikh had been fired over six months before the crime from his job by Rajesh as he was not working properly and he then exacted revenge with the kidnap and murder . According to the prosecution, the accused kidnapped and murdered the boy the same day. They anticipated trouble if they kept him alive, after taking him to Bhiwandi. Later, they kept demanding a ransom of Rs25 lakh from the father, till their arrest next month, on June 5.Dwivedi argued that Shaikh never worked for Rajesh and it was Ansari who did, till his arrest. Dwivedi also said he had not been heard on the quantum of sentence by the trial court.The prosecution could not determine the exact time of death, and the HC found the police failed to satisfactorily establish the body’s recovery.The HC found there were “inconsistencies” over the time of Shaikh’s arrest and held that the “version of prosecution on arrests of accused cannot be accepted.” Dwivedi said they were with crime branch for over nine hours on June 5 while the police station said it had arrested them and recovered cell phones and SIM cards from them.Police said ransom calls were made from Bhiwandi. “Rajesh stated he was requesting that person to reduce the amount and to show him his son. All these conversations were tape-recorded and police listened to it. Police tried to verify the address and name of person calling, but was unable to,” the HC noted.A death sentence has be confirmed by the HC before it is executable."

Mizoram, Sikkim and Nagaland with 3, 74 and 90 cases respectively were at the bottom of the table on such crime. In Bihar, average 8.4 persons per one lakh of the population were kidnapped or abducted against average 8 in the country.

Even if a child is missing or a boy runs away before his exam result, or someone elopes in a love affair, a kidnapping case is registered. It is actually a good sign for us that most of the cases are registered. However, the figure for professional kidnapping is only in double digit,” said Vinay. He further said that around 90,000 FIRs were lodged in 2000, around 2.65 lakh in 2018 and the figure for 2019 is likely to cross 3 lakh.

Altogether 62 children were murdered in Bihar in 2018 and 10 of them were below six years of age, while 17 were between six years to 12 years and 35 above 12 years but below 16 years.

PANAJI: The high court has upheld the life imprisonment and fine imposed by a trial court on two accused for kidnapping and abusing a 11-year-old boy with learning disabilities and demanding a ransom of Rs 20 lakh in 2011.

The two accused were sentenced to life imprisonment and fined Rs 1 lakh each in 2017. They appealed to the high court against the conviction in 2018. The court found that the boy’s testimony, with details of the events that transpired, inspired confidence and was sufficient to bring home the charges against the two.

The court noted that additional public prosecutor Pravin Faldessai proved the case beyond reasonable doubt.

The case pertains to 2011, when the two men entered into a conspiracy and kidnapped the minor boy with learning difficulties in the afternoon from outside the gate of his school. They then called his father and uncle demanding a ransom of Rs 20 lakh, failing which they threatened to kill the boy. They then drove the boy away in a van, before he was rescued by police.

Underscoring the need to maintain the privacy of the victim, the court directed the registry to transmit all the records back to the children’s court so that the boy’s identity, which appears in various records, be protected.

The court found that in several places, there was reference to the victim’s name. “This is to be avoided at all costs,” the division bench comprising justices Mahesh Sonak and M S Jawalkar stated in their judgment on Friday.

They added that the Goa Children’s Act, 2003, which deals with the procedure before the children’s court, specifically provides that the children’s court abides by the principle of right to privacy and confidentiality of the minor child, and that these be protected by all means and through all stages of the proceedings.

“Therefore, we direct that the name of the minor child in the records shall be masked, no doubt, by maintaining the records regarding the identity of the minor child in sealed cover,” the high court stated.

HYDERABAD: A cab driver was taken into custody for allegedly making a bid to abduct three youngsters, including a minor boy, near Shamshabad - 24 kilometres south of Hyderabad - on Friday.

Around 8.30am, driver Patlavath Kishan, 28, started the trip from Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA) without keying in OTP and picked up another person on the way after starting the journey, police said.

“A family of four came from Mumbai to meet a friend in the city. Their flight landed at 7.40am. Their relative came to pick them up at the RGIA on Friday morning,” a police officer from RGIA police station said.

As seven people were to travel back from the airport to Yousufguda, they booked a cab. “Three youngsters — two girls (a 22-year-old from the city and an 18-year-old girl) and a 16-year-old boy, who travelled from Mumbai — boarded the cab. After boarding the cab, they gave OTP to driver Kishan to start the journey; he reportedly said his app was not working and he can drop without keying in the OTP, while they can pay the amount mentioned in the app,” the officer added.

After travelling a couple of kilometres from the airport, the driver picked up another person. “When they questioned, the driver said the passenger was a known person and he will be dropped on the way,” the officer added.

The youngsters became suspicious when the driver hit the accelerator even after they asked him to follow the other car. One of the youngsters called their family and raised an alarm.

“The family asked the driver to stop the car. After they disembarked from the cab, the driver fled the spot. The family approached us,” the officer said.

A kidnapping case was registered by the RGI Airport police against the driver. A little later, they traced the vehicle and took Kishan, a resident of Kothur, into custody.

Anti dacoity squad chief Yashwant Jadhav said three men -- one in a car and two on a motorbike -- intercepted Kherajbhai Bhanushali when he was going home on his two-wheeler after closing his shop on Monday night.

They forced him to sit on the bike at knife-point and sped away, the police official said.

The kidnappers then called his son Deepak, and demanded Rs 50 lakh in ransom. They sat Bhanushali in the car and kept moving.

Deepak informed police, who asked him to keep talking to the kidnappers.

Deepak negotiated the ransom sum down to Rs 2 lakh. The kidnappers asked him to come to Saint Mary's school and drop the money at a certain location.

But he insisted that they first release his father.

Apparently sensing that the police were closing in on them, the kidnappers released Bhanushali near the school before any money was paid to them in the early hours, and managed to flee though the police team tried to chase them, Jadhav said.

Members of the local trader community on Tuesday felicitated superintendentof police S Chaitanya, Jadhav, local crime branch chief Rajendra Singh Gour and inspector Devidas Shelke for securing Bhanushali's release."

Police said the woman had probably fled home with the youth, Partha Sarkar, after developing an affair with him through a popular social networking site. Sarkar was arrested by the Jharkhand police team from his rented accommodation in Bengali Colony locality of Bettiah town.

“The woman is wife of a Jharkhand police constable and the couple have an eight-year-old son and a two-year-old daughter. The woman’s little daughter was also found at the rented house of Sarkar,” Jharkhand police sub-inspector (SI) Suryakant Kumar said.

SHO of Ranchi’s Chutia police station Ravi Thakur told TOI over the phone that the woman’s husband had lodged a missing complaint on November 30 after she became traceless. “The complaint was later converted into an FIR on December 8,” the SHO added.

SI Suryakant said the Jharkhand police team reached Bettiah at 3.30am on Wednesday and raided Sarkar’s rented accommodation. “Sarkar works at a private firm in Bettiah. He was produced in a court in Bettiah which granted his 28-hour transit remand,” the SI said, adding a kidnapping case was lodged after the woman went missing from her house.

“Technical investigations helped us locate the woman. Sarkar had gone to Ranchi to bring the woman to his home on November 30. After reaching Bettiah along with her two-year-old daughter, the woman started living with Sarkar. The two had switched off their cellphones after leaving Ranchi on November 30,” the SI said, adding Partha will be produced before a Ranchi court. “The woman’s statement will also be recorded at the court of judicial magistrate,” he said.

AGRA: A 24-year-old woman received burn injuries after hot cooking oil spilt over her at her home in Gadi Daya village under Pachokhara police station on Saturday evening, in what is suspected to have been a kidnapping attempt.

Speaking to TOI, Chote Lal , father of the victim Khusboo, said, “My daughter was preparing evening snacks when three of our neighbours barged inside our house to kidnap her. When she resisted, the accused threw hot oil from the pan on her body.”

According to police, the victim had burn injuries on the right side of her face, shoulder and back. Based on Khusboo’s written complaint, three men — Ghanoranjan Singh (35), his younger brother Mohit Singh (28) and brother-in-law Amardeep (30) — have been identified.

The victim said, “All three used to pass lewd comments at me. When I confronted them, they attacked me.”

Speaking to TOI, Pachokhara inspector Sanjay Singh said, “Our initial probe suggests there was no kidnapping attempt, but Khusboo did suffer burn injuries as she fell on a pan filled with hot oil, after being slapped by Ghanoranjan, who claims he was enraged after victim hurled cuss words at him.”

“The trigger for the spat was a sum of Rs 50,000 which Ghanoranjan was supposed to return to Chote Lal, but has failed to. On Saturday, he and Chote Lal were engaged in a heated argument over the due amount, when Khusboo intervened and hurled abuses at Ghanoranjan, who slapped her in retaliation,” said officer. Chote Lal though insisted it wasn’t money that triggered the scuffle, but the lewd comments.

The accused, who were booked under IPC sections 364 (kidnapping for murder), 511 (attempt to commit offences), 307 (attempt to murder) and 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt), are yet to be arrested.

Amit Ramavtar

MUMBAI: Crime branch on Tuesday cracked a 20-year-old kidnapping-and-murder case, which was closed twice after police failed to trace the suspect. Main accused Sajjid Abdul Rashid Arai (44), on the run since 1999, was staying in Shrivardhan in Raigad with a fictitious identity.

Unit IX, which was discreetly working on the case, got a tip-off that Aria often travelled to Mumbai for his fishing business. “After keeping a watch for some time, our team, led by inspector Sanjeev Gawde and Asha Korke, laid a trap and arrested Arai, who flashed ID cards showing his name as Moin Ahmed Kadri. He admitted he was Arai after sustained interrogation,” said senior inspector Mahesh Desai.

In 1999, a senior PWD official from Patna, Bihar, lodged an FIR with Juhu police, that his son, Amit Kumar Ramavtar, studying at IIT-B, had gone missing, and some people demanded a ransom of Rs 5 crore. After bargaining, the amount was reduced to Rs 5 lakh, but the accused got scared as the father was influential. He and his accomplice forced Amit to drink liquor, killed him and dumped his body in a creek in Vasai, and fled.

Juhu police had registered a kidnapping case as the body was not found. In 2000, they closed the case, classifying it as ‘A summary’, that is when police submit a detail investigation report in court that the case is true, but undetected despite efforts. But the father, Ramavtar, approached courts. In 2007, on a court direction, the case was handed over to crime branch. In 2008, crime branch submitted an ‘A summary’ report and closed investigations too, said DCP Akbar Pathan.

After police arrested Arai, he told them that the victim, studying with them, said he was the son of an influential person. He and his friend Abbas thought the victim was rich and decided to kidnap him to extort money. But Arai said that they developed cold feet at the last minute and strangled the victim, dumped his body, and fled. Arai said that while he left Mumbai, Abbas met with an accident and died, said Desai.

A police team will on Thursday visit Vasai, along with the accused, to identify the spot. Arai had been arrested for murder by Ratnagiri police in 2013.

CHENNAI: A 40-year-old woman and two of her relatives were arrested on Sunday for kidnapping a man, who had refused to marry her daughter, from Thiruvottiyur on Saturday night.

Kavitha, Shankar Kumar, 28, and Hari Krishnan, 25, were charged with kidnapping, and assault and remanded in judicial custody.

Police said, Krishnaraj, 25, a private company employee from Seyyar, Kancheepuram, was dating a 20-year-old girl from Chennai for the past one year. They worked at the same firm and spent a lot of time in each other’s company. Krishnaraj had also promised to marry the girl. Last month, they decided that they will meet their parents and tell them about the relationship and even fix a wedding date.

Trouble started last week when Krisharaj started ignoring her calls and avoided meeting her. When asked about his change in behaviour, he told her that he wanted to break it off with her.

When she asked him the reason, he alleged that she was having an affair with another colleague and was not interested in marrying her anymore.

The girl went and complained to her mother and even threatened to kill herself. Kavitha, who got worried about her daughter, involved two of her relatives and decided to convince Krishnaraj to marry her daughter. When their efforts to convince him proved futile, they devised a plan to kidnap him.

On Saturday, Kavitha made her daughter speak to Krishnaraj. “She told him that she would not get in touch with him anymore and wished to meet him one last time,” said the investigating officer. They decided to meet at a temple.

Krishnaraj took his friend Vasantha Kumar, who’s an advocate, along with him. Upon reaching the temple, he started talking to the girl. Taking advantage of the situation, Kavitha and two others bundled up Krishnaraj in a car and drove away.

His advocate friend lodged a complaint with the Thiruvottiyur police. The police team found them at a garbage dumping ground near Manali and the trio was arrested.

Police said Shankar is an LLB graduate, while Hari is pursuing law in Andhra Pradesh.

Director general of police K Tripathy

CHENNAI: Five men on Tuesday attacked an inspector of police after he tried to rescue a man the gang had abducted in a car on Anna Salai. All five were soon nabbed and the vehicle seized.

A court later sent M Raja Hussain, an accused in the 1995 bomb attack at the Hindu Munnani office at Chintadripet, his son Mohammed Saifullah 27, and Trichy residents S Rahmadullah, 25, A Asif Khan, 22, and S Thoufiq, 22, to jail. They were charged with kidnapping Royapettah resident K Faisuddin and attacking Triplicane police inspector Mohandoss.

On Wednesday afternoon, an order issued by director general of police K Tripathy transferred inspector Mohandoss to Madurai (south zone) on administrative grounds with immediate effect. The order further requested the inspector general of police, Madurai (south zone), to ensure he was in a non-sensitive post.

A police officer said Madurai native Raja Hussain, 48, who has a murder case pending against him at Vilathikulam in Tuticorin district, had appeared for trial on Tuesday. He and the others called Faisuddin, 48, who had not repaid the ?10 lakh he had borrowed from Hussain nearly a year ago, to a restaurant on Anna Salai around 11pm.

All the six were talking outside the restaurant when Faisuddin sought some more time to return the sum and Hussain slapped him, the officer said, based on the statement from the arrested men. The five men then bundled him into the car and drove away.

A few men standing outside the restaurant saw the man being dragged into the car and alerted the police control room. A team of personnel from the Triplicane station led by inspector Mohandoss rushed to the spot and then received information that the car was parked near the Royapettah clock tower, a short distance away.

The police team went there and the inspector is said to have asked them to release Faisuddin and come to the police station. Hussain and the others refused and instead picked up an argument with the inspector, claiming that it was an internal issue and that they would sort it out themselves. The argument soon led to a clash before Hussain and his men manhandled the inspector.

The other police personnel in the vehicle jumped into the fray, overpowered the men and brought them to the police station.

They were questioned and arrested. The inspector was taken to a private hospital and treated for minor injuries.

THRISSUR: Police are hunting a group of men who kidnapped a film director near Chittilappilli Mulloorkkayal area in Thrissur on Wednesday morning.

A group of people wearing masks stopped Nishad Hassan and his wife Pratheeksha as they were driving to Guruvayur. The abductors who came in another car, waylaid the couple. They brutally attacked the director and the woman when she tried to protect him, Pratheeksha said in her statement to Peramangalam police . The abductors bundled him into a car and sped away, leaving the woman behind.

Police said Pratheeksha, who was injured in the attack, was admitted to Amala Hospital and later discharged.

Hassan’s film “Viplavam Jayikkanullathanu’’ was released last Friday. Hassan and Pratheeksha were going to Guruvayur to make offerings at the temple there after the film’s release. In her statement to police, Pratheeksha said there were some disputes between Hassan and the film’s producer and that her husband’s abduction could be linked to it.

Hassan has made a few short films and documentaries and “Viplavam Jayikkanullathanu’’ was his first full-length feature. The nearly two-hour film has created a record of sorts as it was made in a single shot. One of the film’s crew members said the shooting was completed in 2017 and that the post-production works got delayed after the relationship between producer and director turned sour.

Police officers said efforts are on to trace Hassan and nab the kidnappers. Pratheeksha’s family members said they have not received any information on the whereabouts of Hassan. His mobile phone is at home and the police have looked into the call details.

City police commissioner Yathish Chandra said four teams have been formed to conduct investigations into the kidnap case, and that Guruvayur assistant commissioner of police is supervising the investigation. CCTV visuals from nearby areas are also being examined, he said.

AHMEDABAD: Vatva police rescued Alpesh Thakor, 25, of Vatva on Saturday night from his girlfriend’s relatives. Police officials said they have detained the accused who are being questioned by police in Viramgam from where Thakor was rescued.

According to the FIR lodged by Thakor’s elder brother Prakash, an autorickshaw driver, his mother is from Viramgam and Thakor used to frequent the place. “The FIR says that there he fell in love with a woman. Two or three months later, she visited Thakor’s house and told him and his family that her father is getting her married in two days,” said a police official. “Prakash called the woman’s father and escorted the woman to him.”

PATNA: Patna police held a class-IX student on Sunday for allegedly faking his own kidnapping to take Rs 15 lakh as ransom from his family in order to fulfill his dream to purchase a high-end sports bike worth around Rs 2 lakh and invest in land.

The kidnapping case came to light before police at around 7pm on Saturday after mother of the student, aged around 16 year, reached Shashtri Nagar police station in state capital from Muzaffarpur to lodge a kidnapping case.

Police also arrested minor’s cousin named Amit Kumar (19) for connivance in entire case.

While Amit was forwarded to jail, the minor was sent to remand home after production before juvenile justice board, Patna SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma said adding the minor had went till Varanasi by train but returned after mounting pressure and depleting money.

Sharma said sections of Indian Penal Code (IPC) in FIR for kidnapping would be changed and minor would be charged for extortion from mother in Amit’s connivance.

He said case was solved by midnight on Saturday when minor himself surfaced near Patna railway junction by informing his mother over phone that kidnappers had set him free after noting his name and other details including address.

“His sole aim was to purchase a sports bike whose market price is above Rs 2 lakh and enjoyment. Besides, he had planned to invest in real estate after giving Rs 1 lakh to Amit as share,” he said.

Sharma said minor’s parents were capable of paying Rs 15 lakh as his father works in Russian as wielder since last several years.

SSP said the boy is native of Paroha village under Motipur police station area in Muzaffarpur and his parents had set him up at Machhli Gali under Shashtri Nagar police station area in September last year for better schooling.

“He was living with maternal uncle’s family who works as a trolley man at Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS),” SSP said adding minor name’s was registered in private school under Airport police station area for studies.

He said Amit was minor’s maternal cousin living at Macchli Gali in rented accommodation.

Sharma said Amit along with minor’s two more friends were picked up by police on basis of suspicion at around 10pm. “Two were set free but Amit spilled the beans,” he said.

SSP said minor had left maternal uncle’s residence at around 6am after which he rang his mother at around 8.30am that four people had kidnapped him and were demanding Rs 15 lakh as ransom.

“He again made a call at 11am asking his mother if money was arranged. To this, she replied in affirmative. The final call was made at around 11.30pm in which minor informed his mother that he was set free,” SSP added.

PATNA: A 23-year-old college student from Gaya, who was on a trip to the famed Kakolat waterfall in Nawada with friends, was allegedly kidnapped, beaten up and forced to marry a teenage girl at gunpoint at a nearby village late on Sunday, police said.

Nityanand Kumar Rai, who was rescued by the police and is undergoing treatment at a government hospital in Gaya, fell victim to what is colloquially known as ‘pakadua vivah’ or forced marriage, which cops say is a regular occurrence in the region.

In his police complaint, Nityanand Kumar Rai alleged that he and his friends were waylaid by some youths, who came on three bikes and forcibly took them to Singhana village, where he was forced to tie the knot with a Class X student of a Nawada school.

“I was not only threatened but also beaten up when I refused to follow their orders. Me and my friends were held captive in separate rooms. Around midnight, some residents came with illegal firearms, threatened me and forced me to marry the girl,” Rai told the police.

The next morning Rai was told to stay at his ‘newly wedded’ wife’s house while his two friends were released with a warning not to inform the police.

His friends, however, informed Nityanand’s father Shankar Rai, a resident of Paharpur in neighbouring Gaya district, about the incident. Rupau police swung into action and rescued the youth from the girl’s house after the intervention of senior police officers.

“The girl was taken to Nawada (civil) court to record her statement but the court has directed her to appear on Wednesday,” Rupau SHO Santosh Kumar said. Further action will be taken on the court’s directive since it’s a case of ‘ pakarua vivah ’, he added.

The ‘bride’, however, claimed that she knew the man’s family. “I had met Nityanand when he visited the village on June 15 to attend a wedding ceremony. We knew each other for long,” she told the police when she was called for questioning.

The police have lodged a case under Section 366 (kidnapping for marriage) of IPC against the girl’s family members. SHO Kumar said ‘pakarua vivah’ is quite common in the region. Such cases were reported mainly from Munger, Nawada, Khagaria and Begusarai districts where prospective bridegrooms are kidnapped for marriage.

In December 2017, a 29-year-old Bokaro Steel City engineer was kidnapped from Patna and forced to marry a young girl. A video showing the forced marriage of the engineer had gone viral on social media and an FIR was lodged in January 2018.

Statistics available with the state crime record bureau revealed that altogether 1,097 cases of ‘pakarua vivah’ have been reported in the state so far. In 2018, a total of 4,301 cases were registered in the state compared to 3,678 in 2017 while 3,070 men were kidnapped for ‘pakadua vivah’ in 2016, 3,000 in 2015 and 2,526 in 2014.

“What is noticeable is that such cases are on the rise in the state,” a senior IPS officer said. The state government has directed the police to take tough action against those demanding dowry. The cops have been told to implement the provisions of Anti-Dowry Act more effectively.

NEW DELHI: Five men have been arrested for allegedly kidnapping and killing a 64-year-old businessman from south Delhi's Greater Kailash last month, police said on Thursday.

Arun Sharma was abducted and strangulated on November 15 and his body disposed of the same day near Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh , they said.

The accused have been identified as Dr Rishi Rajpal Singh Chauhan, (64), Hitesh Chauhan (29), Amet Vikram Chhabra (32), Priyank Khanna (34) and Sahil (25), all residents of Gurugram. They were arrested on Wednesday, police said.

The mobile phones and a car used in the crime were recovered by the police.

A complaint was received about Arun's disappearance from his sister Shashi Kiran Sharma, on November 15. She said that Arun had left his Kailash Colony residence to attend a court proceedings in Gurugram, said BK Singh, additional DCP(crime Branch).

Arun failed to meet his lawyer and also did not return back home. Shashi also told police about an ongoing property dispute between Arun and accused Rishi Chauhan.

Arun has purchased a property, estimated to be worth Rs three crore, from Rishi Chauhan and his wife, in 2009. However, the possession of the property was not transferred to him by Chauhan, complained Shashi.

Later, Arun secured a favourable order from Supreme Court in this regard, in September 2019. He was going to attend the case in Gurugram, related with execution of SC order in his favour, when he was allegedly kidnapped and killed by the accused.

During interrogation, police learnt that Rishi hatched a plan with his friend Harsh Chabra to eliminate Arun. In return of Rs 25 lakh, Harsh assured to fix his problem, said the officer.

Harsh involved his own son Amet in the plan which was joined by other accused, the officer said

The accused kidnapped Arun in their car near Kailash Colony Metro station while he was headed to Gurugram. They threw away Arun's mobile phone after taking out the SIM card, the officer said.

Later, Amet informed Rishi that the job has been done and also sent him a picture of the deceased Arun on Whatsapp to prove his claim, said the officer.

The accused travelled to Jhansi and dumped Arun's body there. They also threw away identification papers and bank cards of the deceased near Palwal, he added.

Aurangabad: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court, in a relief to three members of an Ahmednagar-based family, quashed and set aside an FIR filed against them for kidnap of a 19-year-old woman and theft at her mother’s home.

The girl had left her mother’s home and married a man of her choice. Based on a complaint by her mother, a 46-year-old resident of Mukundnagar, the Topkhana police had booked Shahrukh Shaikh (28), a businessman, his father Khalil (48) and mother Sharifa (43) of Sangamner.

The woman said her daughter left for college and but didn’t return. She initially filed a missing complaint. Then, Shahrukh called her to inform that he and her daughter were getting married. The woman went to the police accusing the Shaikhs of kidnap. She added her daughter had taken Rs 1.5 lakh and jewellery of Rs 38,000 from home.

The Shaikhs, and the woman’s daughter, moved the HC by filing separate criminal application, seeking to quash the FIR and subsequent proceedings. Both applications were heard simultaneously.

While allowing the criminal application on December 2, the bench comprising Justices T V Nalawade and N B Suryawanshi noted the statement of the girl, in which she said she had a relationship with Shahrukh and that she left on her own to avoid marrying as per her mother’s choice. The court observed: “Her statement does not show the other applicants had any role to play. There is record of marriage created as per Muslim religion.” The bench added: “It is unfortunate the girl’s mother has made such allegations only because the girl left home to marry applicant No. 1 (Shahrukh). It cannot be believed that ornaments purchased in 2016, which are ordinarily kept on person, were kept in cupboard.”

It added: “It also does not look probable that cash of Rs 1.5 lakh that was part of sale proceeds of transaction of 2017 was kept in cupboard of informant (the mother). That transaction of sale was made by others, not by informant.”

The bench said: “It will be abuse of process of law if the applicants are made to face the trial for aforesaid offences.”

CHENNAI: A two-year-old girl, who was kidnapped from MGR Chennai Central railway station early on Monday, was rescued the same day at Dindigul railway station by the Government Railway Police personnel after they were alerted by a few passengers travelling by the Mumbai-Nagercoil Express.

The passengers, who noticed the man begging with the girl who was continuously crying, questioned the man. They found his replies unsatisfactory and realised the girl may have been kidnapped and they informed GRP police personnel at Dindigul railway station.

Police identified the accused as Deepak Mandal, 32, a native of West Bengal.

The police officers rushed to the spot, questioned Mandal and confirmed he had kidnapped Rejitha, 2, when she was sleeping beside her mother Marjina from Guwahati, Assam.

After the rescue, the girl brought to Chennai Central railway station and reunited with her mother before the two were sent back home by train. Police said Mandal, who had been doing odd jobs and staying on the footpath on Walltax Road was sent to jail.

A police inspector said, “Deepak who boarded the Dhanbad-Alappuzha Express with Rejitha got down at Salem and boarded the Mumbai-Nagercoil Express. He begged on the train, with the child in his arms, and after a few passengers objected and questioned him, he got off at Dindigul railway station. Railway police there secured him and informed us.” Mandal allegedly kidnapped the girl after a quarrel with Marjina’s husband Hameed.

The GRP personnel said Marjina and Hameed came with their daughters Hajitha, 4, and Rejitha to Chennai Central about 10 days ago where they met Mandal. “Hameed and Deepak used the two-year-girl to beg on the station premises with the knowledge of her mother,” said police. Marjina was a construction worker in the city.

PATNA: A day after the safe recovery of Chausa PACS chairman’s son Manish Ranjan from Motihari, police arrested another youth from Patna for his alleged involvement in his kidnapping case on Tuesday evening. Police had arrested eight youths in the case on Monday night.

The arrested accused was identified as Yamraj alias Ujjwal Kumar. “The youths planned to randomly kidnap anyone for making easy money through ransom and lead a lavish life. Ankit Kumar alias Ankit Sarkar and Sanjeet Kumar Singh were their group leaders,” City SP (central) Vinay Tiwary said.

Others arrested in the case were identified as Raju Mishra alias Rajnish Mishra, Shivendra Kumar Chaubey, Rahul Kumar alias Charsi, Kamal Kumar Pandey alias Prince, Arjun Kumar alias Sunny and Srijan Kumar Gupta, all in their early 20s.

The SP said kidnappers had planned to take ransom of around Rs10-15 lakh from Manish’s father after they came to know that he was a PACS chairman’s son. They were, however, arrested before making any ransom call.

Manish was kidnapped while walking with another friend Raghvendra Singh near Sai temple under Patliputra police station on January 9 evening. He had come to Patna to write the JEE Main examination from his native village Chausa in Buxar district. Manish’s father Manoj Kumar Singh is Chausa primary agriculture cooperative society (PACS) chairman.

He was recovered from a lodge under Town police station area in Motihari on Monday. A Patna police team led by Tiwary had gone to Motihari for conducting raids and rescuing the victim.

Tiwary said Ujjwal was one of the five kidnappers inside the car when they kidnapped Manish from roadside. He said altogether ten youths were involved in the case. “Car used for kidnapping Manish was also seized from Motihari,” he said.

“Sanjeet and Ankit had planned the kidnapping and hired a car using an app for three days at Rs2000 rent per day. They took Manish to Motihari via Gopalganj,” he said, adding the duo with one more were arrested from Patna..

The SP said police laid a trap after which four more kidnappers got arrested from Motihari. The lodge where they had kept Manish was also raided, leading to recovery and arrest of another kidnapper.

Bareilly: Two constables, Akshay Uppal and Nikhil Pawar, were among three persons arrested for allegedly kidnapping a 22-year-old man in UP’s Moradabad and “demanding ransom money from his family to let him free”. Pawar’s cousin Ashish was also arrested. The two constables have been suspended, police said on Saturday.

Moradabad man Salman, said to be a police informer, was asked to reach near a canal from where he was allegedly kidnapped by the cops who later informed his family that special operations group (SOG) team had taken him into custody to probe a matter. They later demanded Rs 2 lakh in lieu of releasing him. According to police sources, Salman used to provide information to the two constables.

Notably, Thakurdwara circle officer Vishal Yadav said that Salman was a resident of Ganinagar under Mudhapandey police station and was part of a baggage lifting gang. “During investigation, Salman confessed that he had been involved in stealing bags of train passengers and committed several thefts near Gorakhpur. The government railway police and railway protection force have been informed and we asked them to trace his criminal record. But, we have no concrete proof against him yet,” Yadav, the deputy superintendent of police (DSP), said.

According to police, Uppal had come in contact with Salman about six months ago after he raided a gambling site. Though, he didn’t get any success, he found a mobile phone from the crime scene which eventually led him to Salman. Over the period, Uppal developed a good rapport with him as the latter became his informer. Salman used to give him important leads and based on his tip off, Uppal managed to crack several cases. Salman had reportedly informed him about his nexus in the Gorakhpur railway station area.

“On Thursday, Uppal learnt that Salman had just returned from Gorakhpur after committing a theft and had money. He shared the information with his colleague Pawar and hatched a plan to recover money from Salman by threatening him in the name of SOG. Their plan, however, didn’t work,” the DSP said.

Uppal is a native of Muzaffarnagar while Pawar and his cousin belong to Baghpat district. After “kidnapping” Salman, the trio took him around in a moving car for two hours and let him go only when they learnt that they were on the radar of other cops. Before leaving home, Salman had told his family that he was going to meet Uppal.

Police arrested the trio from Bhojpur area and lodged an FIR under sections 364A (kidnapping for ransom) and 392 (punishment for robbery) of IPC. “Both the policemen have been suspended and a report against them has been sent to police headquarters,” the DSP added.

The two-year-old girl who was kidnapped from Palam village last Saturday was reunited with her family (in pic)... Read More

NEW DELHI: A two-year-old girl who was kidnapped from Palam Village last Saturday was reunited with her family on Friday. Two men who had hatched the plan to kidnap the child have been arrested.

The prime accused, Virender Dutt, had brought in an accomplice, Nikhil Choudhary, by promising him one-third of Rs 3 lakh for which he had planned to “sell” the child. Dutt, however, had kidnapped the girl as he was childless. He had even created fake documents of an adoption centre in Faridabad to keep her.

The kidnapping occurred on November 23 when the girl and her 11-year-old brother were playing outside a temple. The two accused went there on a motorcycle and tried to engage the children in a conversation. They then went inside the temple. Coincidentally, when they came out, the girl and her brother were seated on their motorcycle. They took them for a joyride, dropped the boy just before Dwarka and sped away with the girl.

Police scanned CCTV footage from the temple and got an unclear description of the accused. They tried to match the photos of the accused with police records, but to no avail. Cops put up posters of the girl and started tracking the possible route taken by the kidnappers. In another footage, police were able to spot a motorcycle headed towards Najafgarh and got a partial numberplate (HR 06 159).

After scanning possible matches with registration numbers of motorcycles, two of them surfaced, one in Panipat and one in Sirsa. The Panipat motorcycle couldn’t be traced, but the owner in Sirsa was tracked. He told police that he had sold the bike. However, the buyer informed that it had been stolen.

“When further CCTV footage was scanned, we found one of the accused men entering lane number 7 in Palam Village riding the two-wheeler. At the exit of the lane, both the accused were spotted,” said DCP (Southwest) Devender Arya.

Cops then conducted a door-to-door search, spotted one of the accused coming down the stairs of a house and nabbed him. The man, identified as Choudhary, told police he had come to Delhi three months ago and Dutt had lured him into committing the crime. Subsequently, Dutt’s number was put on surveillance and tracked to Nihal Vihar. A raid was conducted late at night and Dutt was arrested from his house. The girl was also recovered.

Dutt’s family was unaware about the kidnapping as he had told them that he had adopted the girl from Geeta Ashram. The fake adoption certificate was recovered from his house. Dutt told police that he had purchased the motorcycle from one Gagan. The motorcycle was also seized during the raid.

AGRA: Aligarh police has booked the chief medical superintendent (CMS) and her staff of the government's district women's hospital on charges of ""kidnapping"" a newborn boy after a couple lodged a complaint claiming that the hospital staff handed them just one child while the woman was carrying “twins”.According to complainant Satendra Kumar, his wife Sangeeta was under treatment at Aligarh’s Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyay Joint Hospital during her pregnancy. He claimed that during the course of treatment, three ultrasounds were conducted, in February, March, and May this year by the hospital staff, and according to the report, his wife was carrying “twins”.

The complainant further said that his wife had delivered “twins” on June 9, at the district women’s hospital, but only a baby boy was given to the family members. He alleged that the doctors and nurses, who were on duty that day had ""stolen"" his second child.

However, Aligarh senior superintendent of police Akash Kulhary told TOI that a doctors’ panel formed by the chief medical officer re-examined the radiologist’s report and found it to be “erroneous”. “Police investigation is still on though,” he said.

Chief medical officer Dr ML Agarwal said that the medical panel concluded that no evidence was found to support the complainant’s claim of his wife giving birth to “twins”. Agarwal said that the hospital’s radiologist had admitted his mistake of wrongly mentioning “twins” in the report and action will be taken against him.

Aruna Rai, SHO of Banna Devi police station in Tappal, told TOI that the CMS, an unidentified doctor and a nurse had been booked under sections 363 (kidnapping), and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of IPC.

When contacted, the visibly upset CMS said, “An FIR should have been lodged only after the panel’s decision.”

PATNA: Unidentified persons allegedly kidnapped the 19-year-old son of Chausa primary agriculture credit society (PACS) chairman Manoj Kumar Singh from Sai Temple area under Patliputra police station in the state capital on Thursday evening.

KOCHI: Ernakulam Rural police has recorded a steady rise in the number of kidnappings and abductions over the past five years even as Kochi city police numbers show a decline.

According to the latest report of the District Crime Records Bureau, a total of 37 kidnapping cases were reported in rural areas of the district 2019. Of these, 27 involved a woman or girl victim. In 2016, the total number of cases stood at 11.

The city police registered 13 cases in 2015. This dropped to six in 2019, after rising to 19 in 2017.

According to police officials, the majority of such abductions involve sexual abuse. “We invoke IPC sections 370 (trafficking) and 363 (kidnapping) along with offences like rape and child abuse. This is actually a graver offence as the victim is not in a position to give consent or is tricked into being taken somewhere,” said M J Sojan, additional superintendent of police, Ernakulam.

Experts say the higher numbers in rural areas is because it is difficult to hush up such cases in such neighbourhoods. Fr Jenson Varyath, director of Ernakulam Childline, said city parents are less likely to come out and report such an offence than those in rural areas. “Now, due to various awareness drives, more cases of sexual abuse are getting reported in rural areas. It is difficult to keep things quiet in a rural neighbourhood as compared to the city where things can be kept under wraps. Also, parents are not that forthcoming in reporting such crimes in the city,” said Fr Varyath.

Police say most of the kidnapping cases in the district involve either minor girls cheated on the pretext of love or women given false promises, including of marriage, and are taken to various locations where they are sexually assaulted.

ASP Sojan added that officers realizing the need for adding the charge of abduction to sexual abuse cases due to the efforts of police wings like the anti-human trafficking unit is also another reason for the spike in rural areas. P S Muhammed Ashraf, a police official who works with the special juvenile police unit (SJPU), said there have been instances where child labourers were rescued, only to reveal a kidnapping or abduction angle.

“In many cases, follow-up investigations would suggest that the children were trafficked from other states or other districts. In such cases too, FIRs are registered for kidnapping and abduction,” said Ashraf.

Moreover, Bindu P A, special public prosecutor with the Ernakulam Pocso court, said that about 40% of abuse cases get settled due to various reasons, such as the victim refusing to go forward with the complaint.

“At least in Ernakulam, most cases with enough evidence lead to conviction. In fact, around six in 10 cases lead to conviction. However, due to the vast area that comes under the Ernakulam court, there are around 450 cases which are pending,” said Bindu.

CHENNAI: Police on Saturday rescued a 44-year-old realtor from a hideout at Thirumangalam where he was taken by kidnappers after he sold a property worth 2.75 crore to a man using forged documents. Five people were arrested and a car seized.

The victim, Sudalaimuthu of Kallikuppam near Ambattur, went out on Friday after he received a call on his mobile phone. His wife Roja tried to reach him on his mobile but found it turned off.

AURANGABAD: With Maharashtra recording the highest number of missing cases of women and children in the country, the state police are preparing for a special drive to track down the missing/kidnapped persons.

Authorities said the drive follows a high-level meeting chaired by the state home minister on February 10.

As per the latest communication from the Prevention of Atrocities against Women (PAW), a special cell of the director-general of police, a month-long drive will start on March 1. The authorities have received the letter signed by special IGP Pratap Dighavkar, who currently heads PAW.

An officer deployed with PAW maintained that abuse, in any form, is one of the key reasons for women and children to flee home. “Women and children fleeing home are most vulnerable to trafficking and other abuses, making it a concern for the law enforcement agencies as well,” said the officer.

As per the directive issued by PAW, all the cases related to missing and kidnapped women ageing above 18-years, between the years 2015 and 2019 will be probed afresh in the month-long drive, across the state. To ensure that the drive yields results, all the superintendents as well as commissioners of police in the state have been asked to ensure that the drive-related data and developments (if any) are updated to the state police headquarters-based control room by 9 pm every day.

As a preparation for the drive, the authorities have been asked to get police station-wise data of missing women and children, and accordingly, make advanced preparations. All the data on these missing and kidnapped persons have to be compiled by February 29, before the drive kicks off.

As per the data published by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) in the year 2016, as many as 28, 316 cases of missing women were reported from Maharashtra. In 2017, the number rose to 29, 279, while in 2018, the number reached 33, 964. Though the figures for 2019 have not been released yet, considering the average surge in the cases of missing women in the state, the number is likely to increase.

Following the directives, respective unit commanders are forming special teams across police stations to work on these cases. Also, the crime branch and other special cells have been directed to assist the special squads at the police station level.

Hyderabad: Within hours of kidnap of a private contractor in Sultan Bazar on Thursday, five of his business associates were arrested in Saroornagar. A kidnapping case was registered against the five accused.

The accused took away the contractor, Raji Reddy, of Ramanthapur from a lodge at around 5.45 pm. “We arrested the five accused and rescued Reddy,” Sultan Bazar inspector K Subbarami Reddy said.

Police said the issue was over Reddy refusing to pay money for a work the accused had done. Reddy, who got a cable-laying contract of a private telecom firm, sub-contracted the work to Koteswar Rao who, in turn, gave the work to Venkata Krishna and his associates of Vijayawada. “The accused did not make any written agreement with Reddy for the work. They said Raji Reddy had to pay Rs 50 lakh to them for the finished work. However, Reddy refused to pay any money saying he did not owe them anything,” the inspector said. The accused have been identified as L Venkata Krishna, Prakash, Naresh, Ganesh and Sunil. Based on a complaint by Reddy’s friend Narender Swamy through Dial 100, Sultan Bazar police swung into action and rescued him.

A mediator, Srinivas called Reddy, Koteswar Rao and the accused to Haridwar lodge in Sultan Bazar to discuss the matter. “Reddy told the accused that they did not have proper experience in dealing with financial matters of contract works and should consult a senior contractor before coming for discussion. Reddy also refused to pay them any amount and left the lodge,” the inspector said.

Upset over this, the accused forced Reddy get into their car and drove away towards Saroornagar. They insisted that Reddy clear their dues. Cops tracked their movements following Swamy’s alert and arrested the accused, the inspector said.

The accused were produced before a magistrate and remanded in judicial custody.

Ameen Shah, a top militant of the outlawed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), was wanted in several cases of terrorism, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa police chief Sanaullah Abbasi said.

He had kidnapped Qahar, 55, in 2008 and killed her in Pakistan in 2010, he said.

The Taliban had demanded $two million as ransom and release of some of their detained leaders for her release.

Shah was killed in the exchange of fire with the policemen in Bannu district after he refused to surrender, Abbasi said.

Canadian journalist Qahar, 55, who was known as Beverly Giesbrecht before she converted to Islam, was abducted along with her translator Salman Khan and cook-cum-driver Zar Muhammad while travelling to Miranshah in the restive North Waziristan tribal region.

The three were abducted in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa's Bannu region on November 11, 2008.

The Canadian and Pakistan governments had launched joint efforts for her safe release but failed to achieve any positive results.

Khan and Muhammad were released after eight months of captivity due to efforts made by the head of a religious party.

After his release, Khan disclosed that Qahar, who was the owner and publisher of jihadunspun.com website, was suffering from hepatitis and was mentally prepared for death. She was not very optimistic about her release.

In an ""urgent request"" posted on her website under her byline, Qahar had asked for help in getting out of Pakistan, which she described as ""erupting into a full-scale war zone.""

The abductors had earlier threatened to kill Qahar if their demand for ransom was not met by March 30, 2009.

A video sent to the Miranshah Press Club showed Qahar pleading: ""Please help me. Please help me... I request the Canadian government, human rights organisations and media associations to accept their demands and get me released, otherwise they will kill me”.

When Mukesh told them that he did not have the money, they attacked him with liquor bottles.

When they neared Koyambedu, Mukesh jumped out of the car. While the trio fled with the car, Mukesh approached Maduravoyal police.

Police became suspicious when Mukesh started giving contradictory statements. He was also under the influence of alcohol. Police found out that he knew the trio and had consumed alcohol together on Saturday. “They got into a fight in the moving car and after Mukesh got down claiming that he was going to lodge a complaint against them, the trio drove to his house and handed over the keys and his mobile phone,” police said. All four have been detained for further investigation.

PATNA: Altogether 36 cases of kidnapping for murder were recorded across the state in the first three months of the current year against 22 in 2017, 31 in 2016 and 15 in 2015 during the same period.

Two major cases of kidnapping and subsequent murder were recorded recently – one in Begusarai on Tuesday and another in Nawada on Wednesday.

In Begusarai, a 60-year-old trader, Prithvi Chaudhary, was kidnapped from his shop under Birpur police station area in broad daylight on Tuesday. He was shot dead barely few kilometres away from the spot on the same day.

On Wednesday, police recovered mutilated bodies of three youths – Jitendra Kumar alias Rinku, Raj Kumar alias Pallu and Vicky Kumar Rajak – from a shrine on Borambagh hills under Kauwakol police station area in Nawada. The three were kidnapped from Jamui on May 24.

According to data available on the state police website, 11 cases of kidnapping for murder were reported in January, five in February and 20 in March this year.

As far as kidnapping for ransom is concerned, seven such cases were recorded in the state between January and March this year against 15 in 2018, nine in 2017, 12 in 2016 and 14 in 2015 during the same period.

The consolidated data of kidnapping for murder cases reported between April and June this year is yet to be compiled by the state police headquarters.

“Personal enmity, revenge and rivalry between two criminal gangs or groups are mainly responsible for kidnapping for murder cases. On the other hand, organised criminal gangs kidnap people for ransom. All such gangs have been dealt with strongly by police. We have ensured conviction of these criminals through speedy trial. As a result, cases of kidnapping for ransom have come down in the state,” ADG (headquarters) Kundan Krishnan said.

ISLAMABAD: A 45-year-old suspected paedophile — who was arrested from Rawalpindi on Tuesday for allegedly kidnapping a 13-year-old tea vendor last week, then drugging and raping him for four days — has confessed before police that he had raped at least 30 other kids in Pakistan .

The accused Sohail Ayaz, a chartered account by profession, had been working as a consultant in Pakistan government’s planning and development department in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province since November 1, 2017. A day after his arrest, the government terminated his contract on Wednesday.

Ayaz had not only filmed the entire act but also threatened the boy’s family that he would upload the videos on social media if they approached the authorities. Nevertheless, the victim’s mother’s filed a complaint, based on which the arrest was made. On Thursday, two more children came forward alleging that Ayaz had sexually abused them and filmed the act.

The accused had previously worked with ‘Save the Children’, a global non-profit organisation. He went to the UK on a two-year visa and was hired there by the charity. He was arrested in London at the charity’s headquarters after thousands of child pornographic images were found at his home. Ayaz was also wanted in Italy in connection with a Romanian child sex ring.

Ayaz pleaded guilty to multiple sexual offences and was jailed for four years by a court in the UK before being kicked out from Britain in 2009. He was later convicted in Italy and spent six months in prison there before being deported to Pakistan.

He told Rawalpindi Police that he was the ringleader of the ‘International Dark Web’ and had served sentences in both the UK and Italy for sexually abusing children. He also admitted to having sexually abused at least 30 children in Pakistan.

Rawalpindi Police are considering to seek help from Interpol to move forward with the prosecution. “We will require the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA)’s assistance in retrieving the data uploaded by the suspect. Also, if families of the victims do not want to become complainants against the suspect, then we will pursue the cases against him ourselves,” Rawalpindi Police chief Faisal Rana said.

“Ayaz’s parents and wife had parted ways with him many years ago because of his activities,” Rana added.

NEW DELHI: In 1999, Delhi Police's anti-extortion cell was probing the sensational kidnapping of the scion of a Karol Bagh-based pharmaceutical businessman in which ransom calls were being made from Dubai. Extensive surveillance was mounted on possible suspects who might throw up leads.One of the numbers under surveillance belonged to one Sanjeev Chawla , but it went off the radar after being switched off for a few weeks. Sometime later, the number came alive and the police intercepted a series of conversations with a ""foreigner"". Inspector Ishwar Singh , who heard all the conversations out of plain curiosity, was left startled by what he ended up listening to.A quick probe into the antecedents of the number revealed that the foreigner allegedly conversing with Chawla was South African cricket captain Hansie Cronje . The police dug deeper, and soon unearthed one of the biggest ever match-fixing scandals.Chawla was found to be in touch with punters across India to fix the highest bidder.During one conversation tapped by the anti-extortion cell, the police heard him telling someone: ""The captain will come to my room."" They were not sure which captain he was talking about. However, they soon learned that Chawla had a meeting on March 14, 2000 in room 346 of a 5-star hotel in Delhi. After scanning the hotel records, they found that he had met Cronje. It also emerged that ODIs played between India and South Africa in March 2000 had been fixed for ""exchange or consideration"" of money.The case eventually went cold, but got a fresh lease of life in 2013 when then police commissioner Neeraj Kumar reopened it while investigating the IPL spot-fixing racket.On Thursday, Kumar told a news agency that it was during the IPL probe that a media person had pointed out that not even a chargesheet had been filed in the case. ""I asked the then DCP (crime), Alok Kumar , to pursue an extradition and file a chargesheet. I even got in touch with the CBI for this. It was found that the files were lying at the Ashok Vihar police station. It was revived and the chargesheet was filed a day before my retirement,"" he said.In 2016, the crime branch moved court for extradition. Since then the foreign ministry, intelligence wing and Delhi Police had been doggedly pursuing Chawla's extradition."

Baikuntha Handique has been missing since Tuesday

DIBRUGARH: An employee of a stone-crushing unit was kidnapped by suspected Ulfa-I rebels from upper Assam's Tinsukia district on Tuesday evening. The victim, Baikuntha Handique (26), a resident of Jagun, was working as a supervisor of the stone-crushing unit owned by Raju Khan of Digboi .

Confirming the development, Tinsukia superintendent of police Shiladitya Chetia on Wednesday said, ""One Baikuntha Handique, an employee of a stone-crushing unit, has been missing since yesterday (Tuesday). According to information received, he had crossed the river at Wara, southeas tof Jagun, to reach a stone quarry, but has not returned since. We suspect he has been kidnapped by Ulfa-I rebels. We have started a search operation to ascertain his whereabouts. Our counterparts in Arunachal Pradesh have also been intimated and they are aiding us in the operation.""

I tmay be mentioned that in November 2018, a manager of a stone-crushing plant in Jagun, Apurba Kakoty , was abducted by Ulfa-I militants. He was released after eight days following payment of a hefty ransom.

Similarly in October 2019, Gauranga Sudar Deb , a head fitter of Sankar Tea Estate in Talap of Tinsukia district, was abducted at gunpoint by Ulfa-I militants. The abduction was captured on CCTV cameras installed in the factory of the tea garden. Deb was set free after 12 days.

According to intelligence agencies, the Paresh Baruah-led Ulfa-I has been facing acute fund shortage since the military offensive by the Myanmar army against northeast based militant groups operating from Myanmar. Moreover the banned outfit is said to be still reeling from the effect of demonetisation as they reportedly failed to convert their stash of banned high currency note into legal tenders. With funds becoming scarce, the militant outfit has been trying to recoup their losses by indulging in mass extortion targeting the business community and tea planters, especially in the upper Assam districts. The outfit has been indulging in extortion as well as carrying out abduction in the border district of Tinsukia which also serves as a transit point for the militants to cross over to Myanmar through Arunachal Pradesh, where their camps are located.

MUZAFFARPUR: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has succeeded in buying more time to complete the investigation into ‘Navruna’ kidnapping case as the Supreme Court on Tuesday extended the deadline for the same till March 10 next year.

It is the eighth time that the apex court has extended the deadline for completing investigation in the case. The previous deadline was November 23 this year. However, CBI sought another extension for completing the investigation in the case through a miscellaneous application filed in the apex court on November 19, which was granted through the order passed by a division bench on Tuesday.

A source said the court passed the order after getting more concrete information related to the case. “The CBI advocate pleaded that they have got more evidences in the case. Even influential police officers are involved in the case. So, they need more time to complete the investigation in the wake of information given by some of the accused,” said the source.

According to police sources, Navruna (14), a Class VII student, had gone missing from her Jawaharlal Road residence under the jurisdiction of Town police station in Muzaffarpur on the intervening night of September 18 and 19 in 2012. Later, some parts of her skeleton were found in a drain near her residence after two months.

Nagpur: Shrichand Chandwani, who is getting his documents together to get Indian citizenship under CAA, also keeps two more papers handy — a birth certificate of his daughter Pooja, who is now 24 years old, and a police complaint filed back in Derki town of Sindh province in Pakistan after her abduction.

While he is keen to get an Indian passport, Shrichand also longs to be reunited with his daughter, who he claims was abducted by locals from a neighbouring village in Pakistan, and has now been converted to Islam. The birth certificate is to prove that Pooja was a minor of 16 years when she was taken away in March 2011, as mentioned in the police complaint. According to Pakistani law a minor cannot be married off even with her wishes. Shrichand hopes that Indian authorities take note and intervene in the matter to get her back.

Pooja’s abduction took place a year before that of Rinkle Kumari, which drew international limelight, but Pooja remain a forgotten footnote. The family alleges the involvement of a politician — Miya Abdul Haq aka Miya Mithu — in Pooja’s kidnapping. The politician is linked with many other cases too, they said.

“Around 8 to 10 armed persons, including a woman, barged into my house and dragged my daughter Pooja Kumari to a car,” says the report written in Sindhi language. “The complainant has alleged that his daughter has been abducted,” says a note below by the police with a seal on it.

“The real culprit was Kamran Khan, who is now her husband, living in the neighbouring village Lagar,” says Shrichand, who says that he knocked every door, from the local panchayat to the court, but in vain. “Finally, my daughter herself deposed against me saying that she went away willingly and we lost the case,” he says.

“They also kidnapped and confined me for three days. I was stripped off and beaten, leaving my private parts injured, and had to undergo a surgery. They brought my daughter to the hideout where I was kept. They threatened to wipe out our entire family if she did not cooperate,” he alleges.

Shrichand says they soon fled to India as he feared his other daughter would also meet the same fate. Initially, only he got the visa for India. Once here, he met the then home minister P Chidambaram with the help of Kailash Joshi, a BJP member of Parliament, he says, showing a letter. “Chidambaram promptly got the visas cleared, and my family shifted to India, finally reaching Nagpur,” he says. Now, the family is on a long term visa.

“We are ruined now. I had a mansion in Pakistan, here it is a dingy rented apartment. A cloth trader there, now I sell vegetables on a handcart,” he says.

“One needs money to travel back to Pakistan and plead the case for my daughter’s release. You have to spend at least Rs50,000 on a single trip and we are hand to mouth these days,” says his wife Shradha.

The last they could establish any contact with her was two-and-a-half years go on phone, says the family. “We left Pakistan soon after but could manage to establish contact with Kamran’s family through our relative there. It ended with a brief conversation with her. We have heard that she is a mother of three children now,” says the mother.

“In the court, she acted as if she does not recognize us at all,” she said. “It was because she was under threat,” adds Shrichand as he shoes a passport sized photo of Pooja, which is among the few memories of her left.

AURANGABAD: Police probing the sudden disappearance of a 15-year-old girl, who went missing from Nanded on November 19, have said the Class IX student was kidnapped by a 19-year-old youth from Punjab who befriended her through mobile-based online gaming application PUBG.

The girl was rescued from Amritsar in Punjab and both she and the suspect were brought to Nanded late on Thursday. Police on Friday said the rescued girl was sent to the Government Medical College and Hospital, Nanded, for medical tests. Depending on the reports, a decision will be taken on invoking sections of Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, said an official.

Wazirabad police station inspector Sandeep Shivle told TOI that their team was able to successfully rescue the minor girl. The suspected youth from has been arrested on charges of kidnapping. According the police officer, the girl had left home for school on November 19, as per her daily routine. When she did not return home later, her family checked with the school, only to find that she had not gone there. Her family then contacted the girl’s friends and checked with relatives as well, but it was to no avail. They lodged a police complaint following which a kidnapping case was registered against an unidentified person.

A preliminary investigation revealed that the girl, who was addicted to her smartphone, had taken to online gaming over a year ago and often remained glued to her device. As PUBG allowed a voice interaction among the players, the girl came in contact with the youth and they started talking frequently.

An officer privy to the probe said that the girl’s family was unaware of her contact with the youth, until she went missing. The suspect, who is also a junior college student, first befriended the girl online . On November 19, he reached Nanded and took the minor with him to his hometown in Punjab. The Wazirabad police relied on technical details as well as checking internet footprints to zero down on the suspected kidnapper.

Nanded superintendent of police Vijaykumar Magar said the incident has highlighted the extent to which minors are vulnerable to traps laid using social media and online games. “On social media as well as online gaming applications, one comes across unknown users from places from across the globe, making minors, in particular, susceptible to such traps,” said SP Magar. In light of the incident, police have appealed to parents and guardians to restrict and monitor the use of mobile phones by minors, while respecting their privacy.

If I really had to get people kidnapped for myself, I would probably like Bradley Cooper, Saif Ali Khan and Ranbir Kapoor. And since we are talking hypothetically, it might be interesting to get Sidharth Malhotra to kidnap these guys because his character Abhay kidnaps grooms in our film.

Mumbai: A six-year-old daughter of pavement dwellers who was sleeping between her parents under the Matunga flyover was kidnapped, hit with a brick and perhaps sexually assaulted by an unknown person late on Wednesday night. The child has been admitted to Sion Hospital where she is battling serious injuries.

What has baffled the police is that the child was kidnapped from under the flyover which a stone’s throw away from Matunga and Sion police stations.

On Thursday evening, Matunga police were in the process of registering a kidnapping and a suspected sexual assault case against an unknown person.

Sources said if it is medically confirmed that the child was sexually assaulted, police will register an offence under stringent sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. Offences under the Act are non-bailable.

According to Matunga police, the child slept off between her parents under the Matunga flyover on Tuesday night. Around 4am on Wednesday, her mother rose to find her daughter missing. She immediately woke her husband and the two began to look for her.

Around 8am, a college student found the child lying injured behind an ashram at King’s Circle.

She alerted the police who rushed to the spot. The child’s parents too reached soon after. They rushed her to Sion Hospital where she is being treated.

Police said prima facie it appears the child was kidnapped for sexual assault and suspect the assaulter hit her with a brick in a bid to kill her and fled.

Matunga police have formed a special team to trace the suspect. “We have got blurred images of the suspect (from CCTV footage) and have launched a hunt for him,” said an officer of Matunga police.

CHENNAI: Police arrested a driver on Wednesday from Villivakkam for kidnapping a Class X student.

Police said the parents of 14-year-old V Sanjay, a resident of Rajaji Nagar Extension in Villivakkam, grew anxious when he did not return home after his tuitions on Monday evening. His father Vinothkumar, a railway employee, inquired at the tuition centre where teachers told him that his son had left for home around 6.30pm. The boy usually took 10 minutes to reach home.

Vinothkumar then approached the Rajamangalam police who registered a case and began an inquiry.

A man who saw Sanjay near Puzhal told police that the boy was seeking help from auto drivers to reach a nearby police station. He told police that he had overheard Sanjay saying that he was kidnapped.

Locals handed Sanjay over to the Ambattur police who took him home on Tuesday morning.

The 14-year-old told police that a stranger kidnapped him in a car and kept him in a house overnight. But he managed to escape when the kidnapper stepped out to meet his friend. The boy then took a lift to reach Puzhal.

Investigations revealed that R Lokeshwaran, a driver from Ambattur, used his friend's vehicle to kidnap Sanjay and took him to a house in Besant Nagar. He had planned to demand ransom from the boy's family. Lokeshwaran was arrested and produced before a court that sent him to judicial custody.

JAMSHEDPUR/RANCHI: The decapitated bodies of seven Christian Murmu tribals were found strewn deep inside the Saranda forest of Jharkhand’s West Singhbhum district late on Tuesday, bolstering suspicion of a violent feud between two local groups over reviving the Pathalgarhi tribal autonomy movement that had been dealt with an iron hand by the erstwhile BJP-led government.

TOI had reported on Wednesday about heavy police deployment in the area amid unconfirmed reports about seven villagers being killed for their opposition to the stir. While West Singhbhum SP Indrajit Mahata had said a dispute over the Pathalgarhi movement was the possible trigger for the killings, the police came out with a more open-ended hypothesis after the bodies were found.

DGP K N Choubey, who chaired a meeting of the police brass in Ranchi and briefed CM Hemant Soren about the developments, said the investigation was still in a preliminary stage. “We have formed an SIT under the Chaibasa DSP and directed him to probe the killings from all possible angles,” he said. “The SIT should not be prejudiced by the version of the villagers and conduct a neutral investigation. There could be more than meets the eye.”

Sources claimed the police had already pieced together information that suggests supporters of the Pathalgarhi movement kidnapped the seven men, aged between 24 and 35, on Sunday and killed them in retaliation for their opposition to the move to revive the stir. The unidentified killers dumped the bodies, including that of a panchayat representative, in the dense Saranda forest, around 3km from Burugulikera village, the sources added.

Burugulikera is 150km west of the steel city of Jamshedpur.

IGP (operations) Saket Kumar Singh said a police team had reached Burugulikera late on Tuesday after getting information about the killings. Till Wednesday evening, the police hadn’t identified the bodies or picked up any of the suspects.

While senior police officers claimed the faces of the victims were mutilated beyond recognition, local sources identified those killed as deputy gram sabha mukhiya James Buda and fellow villagers Songe Topna, Lomba Buda, Etva Buda, Jawra Buda, Nirmal Buda and Bonam Longa. The bodies have been sent to Sadar Hospital in Chaibasa for post-mortem.

According to sources, a group of tribals keen on reviving the Pathalgarhi movement in West Singhbhum had organised a meeting in Gudri block on Sunday and invited residents of all nearby villages to attend it. A handful of villagers are said to have opposed the idea, resulting in a clash. The seven victims were kidnapped the same evening, the sources said.

Soon after the bodies were found, a political slugfest erupted between BJP and the new JMM-led government over CM Soren withdrawing all sedition cases that had been filed against Pathalgarhi activists by the erstwhile Raghubar Das ministry.

Expressing “deep anguish” over the killings, BJP’s newly elected national president J P Nadda formed a six-member fact-finding team of elected representatives from various states to visit Burugulikera and submit a report within a week.

Subhash Batham (L), his wife Ruby

KATHARIYA VILLAGE (FARRUKHABAD): Subhash Batham, a murder convict who held a fake birthday party for his daughter in UP’s Farrukhabad and then held 25 children who were his “guests” hostage for several hours, was shot dead by police early on Friday morning.

His wife, Ruby, who was allegedly an accomplice to the act, died in a hospital soon after after angry local residents pelted her with stones, lynching her. Police on Friday filed an FIR against 300 unknown people under section 302 (punishment for murder).

Police, forensic teams and the bomb disposal squad (Moradabad) claimed they had recovered 145 crude bombs, including a cylinder bomb and a can bomb, along with wire, battery, tape, sutali (thread) that they said were used in a bomb hurled by Batham, injuring two dial 112 constables and SHO Mohammdabad.

Twenty live cartridges, 11 used cartridges of a country-made pistol and a 315 bore rifle were recovered from his house, police said, along with the used cartridge of an AK-47. Some of the children who had been held hostage had, however, told TOI that they saw only a katta and another country made rifle with Batham.

Police said Batham — who never attended school — acquired his ""bomb-making skills"" during a 12-year stint in jail after he was convicted of murder. The basement in which he held the children hostage doubled up as his laboratory where he painstakingly readied the crude bombs, cops added, suggesting he had been planning his act for a long time.

But as far as his motives are concerned, there are different theories — anger at the residents for boycotting him for a long time for marrying a Dalit woman; allegedly being left out of government schemes and enmity against those who testified against him in court in the murder case.

According to police, Batham had claimed on the night of the incident that the gram pradhan of Kathariya village and a local MLA had falsely implicated him in his uncle’s murder due to which he had ended up wasting his youth in prison. The gram pradhan, Harvir Singh, told TOI that he indeed testified in court against Batham and that’s why the man held enmity against him. “Batham murdered his uncle in 2001 after he had caught him stealing valuables from a neighbour’s house and scolded him. I was a witness in the case.”

Commenting on a letter that Batham had written to authorities — demanding a house and toilet under government schemes — and which he handed to police on Thursday night, the gram pradhan said his demands were baseless. “He had written the letter for a house under the PM Awas Yojana and a toilet under Swachh Bharat Mission years ago.” The real motive, he insisted, was revenge against him and village residents.

Bhojpur MLA Nagendra Singh — who was also the target of Batham’s fury — said that he didn’t know the man but had visited the spot to calm down the situation. “He wanted revenge as he was boycotted by the community for marrying a Dalit woman four years ago,” he said.

Anil Kumar Mishra, SP (Farrukhabad), said, “The hostage situation could have been created to extort money as he demanded Rs 1 crore for each kid. He also wanted all criminal cases expunged against him.” Batham had five criminal cases going on against him in local courts.

Whatever the motive, he was well prepared, claimed police. “The quantity of bombs was good enough to kill everyone in a radius of 50m if they went off at once,” said Farrukhabad special operation group in charge, Dinesh Kumar Gautam.

Batham was shot even as the crowd of 300 pelted stones at their house. “As they were attacking the couple at the front door, we entered the house from the back. When he saw his wife being attacked, he grabbed his country-made rifle after which he was shot dead,” said Mishra.

Some residents, however, alleged that policemen “encouraged local residents to pelt stones at the couple”. On Friday, the couple’s bodies were sent for autopsy, while their two-and-a-half-year-old daughter Kusum was handed over to child authorities.

KATHARIYA VILLAGE, FARRUKHABAD: When 25 children in UP’s Farrukhabad district entered Subhash Batham’s house on Thursday evening, apart from the missing confetti there was little indication that this wasn’t, in fact, a birthday party. They were welcomed by Batham’s wife into a 10 x 8 basement where several packets of snacks, biscuits, chocolates and milk were kept.The cold, mud floor was covered in mats for the kids to sit on. In the ensuing 10 hours in which the crisis unfolded, Batham and his wife reportedly took turns to check up on the kids, with the latter even serving them roti and sabzi.For these children in Kathariya village, most of whom were aged between one and 15, a birthday invite was as rare as it was alluring. Many hail from poor households, with their parents struggling to make ends meet. So when word spread around on Thursday afternoon that a party was to be held, they were eager to join the celebrations. Their parents too felt there was little reason to worry.Batham had a chequered past — he had spent 12 years in prison for killing his uncle — but he hadn’t displayed aggressive behaviour towards anyone in the village and as one villager said, “It had been years since that incident in 2001.” But within hours, as news came that Batham was armed and making demands to release the children, parents started assembling in front of the house, fearing the worst. Inside, the children were anxious but well-fed.A day later, many of the children TOI spoke to said they were still shocked with the turn of events but happy to be back home.The younger ones, however, showed little understanding that they had been at the centre of a raging drama that had everyone on tenterhooks. But most seemed to agree on one thing — their kidnapper was not out to harm them. “I don’t believe he (Batham) wanted to harm us. He warned us to keep quiet and said there would be consequences if we didn’t, but he didn’t hurt anyone,” said Anjali Kumari, the eldest among those who had been held hostage. Batham had a pistol and a rifle with him, said the children, but he never pointed it at them.On Friday, when TOI visited the spot, candy wrappers were strewn across the basement. Instead of a staircase, a ladder paved the way to the dingy space bereft of windows, with an LED bulb the only source of light. A metal door separated the basement from the rest of the house. It was this door that Anjali bolted shut after the children had been stuck in the room for hours and their patience started wearing thin. This cut off Batham’s access to the children and minimised their chances of getting caught in a crossfire. “After I locked the door, Subash uncle and his wife banged on the door several times, but I didn’t open it. Two hours later, we were rescued by police,” said Anjali.While initially scared, the children said they felt better once food was served. Arun Kumar, 10, said that the couple served everyone food and water. “We were given biscuit, chocolate, milk, water and some ate roti and sabzi. But when we wanted to pee, we were told to go in a corner and relieve ourselves,” added Soni Kumari, 12, who was confined along with two of her siblings. As there wasn’t much to do, some of the children went to sleep.When an infant wouldn’t stop crying, Batham decided to go outside to release her. That’s when Anjali shut the door from inside. The children didn’t have to wait long though. A couple of hours, later, police made their way to the building and shot Batham dead.Residents of the quiet village said they were still coming to terms with the incident that had shoved them into the limelight. But things could have turned out differently, said Babli Devi, whose house is next to Batham’s. “Three of my children were in there too. And I will always remember this traumatic night but would I have wanted them dead for it? I don’t think so. Perhaps, police could have caught Batham, instead of killing him.”A police officer said, “We negotiated with Batham for hours and went into the building to arrest him, but he brandished a gun. So we had to shoot.”In Video: Farrukhabad hostage drama: Unaware of trap children wanted to enjoy party"

SAMBALPUR: A man, who was on Sunday discharged from Vimsar , his wife and five-year-old son were allegedly held hostage by a driver due to a row over fare. They were later rescued by locals but the driver is absconding.

Sarbeswar Majhi (30), who was admitted to the orthopaedics ward, hired a vehicle to return to Raj Khariar in Nuapada district. They struck a deal with the driver for Rs 5200 and gave Rs 1600 advance. Once they reached Raj Khariar, Majhi asked the driver to wait while he got the rest of the amount. After waiting for some time, the enraged driver allegedly forced the family to get in and then drove off to Burla. There he kept them locked inside the vehicle. He returned later and took them to another place where they were seen by locals who rescued them.

Hostage drama started before 6 pm on Thursday and ended well past midnight.

FARRUKHABAD: Local residents claim there was a method to the madness of Subhash Batham , the man who held 23 children hostage for hours before the episode ended with police shooting him down and a mob lynching his wife.

Villagers said the hostage-taking appeared to have been planned. Batham, who was out on bail for a year and a half in a 2001 murder case, had invited the children for his daughter's birthday party.

Kanpur inspector general Mohit Agarwal, who led the police team in the rescue operation, said Batham had accumulated some weapons and country-made bombs and may have planned to blow up the house.

The hostage drama started before 6 pm on Thursday and ended well past midnight.

Batham apparently kept the children confined to the basement of his home till police and local residents barged in.

As local people and policemen laid siege to the house in Kasaria village, the 40-year-old initially demanded that the cases against him be dropped.

""Batham was demanding withdrawal of a murder case and we assured that we will talk about it. When we told him that he would be provided a government house, his wife Ruby shouted back, ‘give Rs 1 crore for each child and only then they will be released',"" Agarwal said.

During the siege, Batham also sent out a letter addressed to the district magistrate, local people said.

In the letter, he reportedly complained that he was not allowed to make use of government schemes for housing and building toilets at home. He also alleged that he was being troubled by the Special Operation Group of police.

In 2001, he had allegedly stabbed another villager, Meghnad, to death in a dispute over a drain. He was also accused in three robbery cases.

According to local people, Batham had sold off his four-bigha piece of land and had no regular income.

Though they accepted the invitation to the birthday party for their children, the villagers described Batham as mentally unstable and claimed that people generally kept away from him.

Around 1 am, police barged into Batham's house. Villagers claimed that they too went in around the same time.

While Batham was shot dead by police, local people caught hold of his wife, thrashing her and pelting stones at her, police said.

Superintendent of police Anil Kumar Misra said she was initially rushed to a local hospital and later referred to Lohia hospital. She succumbed to her injuries there.

All children were rescued safely from the basement, police said.

The 23 children are aged between six months and 15 years.

The newly built apartments on the premises of the city police commissionorate

AURANGABAD: The families of serving police personnel, who had moved into the newly constructed flats on the premises of the city police commissionorate, have been facing erratic water supply.

Now, many families are unwilling to continue living on the premises as they do not get regular water supply . They are forced to buy drinking water on a daily basis.

The city police had built smart houses for the staff in multi-storey buildings. There are 10 apartment buildings on the premises and each of these buildings has 28 2BHK flats. The process of allotting the flats was initiated in September 2019.

The storage capacity of the water tank is 5.60 lakh litre and as per the calculation of 1,000 litre/family, the water released by civic body is sufficient for only one day. Currently, there are about 500 families including those of constables, head constables, assistant sub-inspectors, police sub-inspectors and assistant police inspectors residing in these apartments.

Residents said the water supply was normal for the first one month, but things changed drastically soon after. The civic officers ignored the pleas of the senior police officers. The families have been asked to use water judiciously and also store it.

A resident of the B wing said, “We get water only once in five days. It is difficult for us. People want the police to be on duty for 24 hours, but don’t we deserve regular water supply at least.”

She said that due to lack of water, they are struggling with their household work.

A policeman, who is lives in one of the flats, said that for the past several days, he had to go to office without taking a bath.

Residents unanimously said that they are being forced to purchase drinking water. “After getting stressed out on the field, we reach home only to face water woes,” said a head constable.

The women members of the families gathered for a recent haldi-kunku event organised by the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Meena Makwana, and expressed their anger before the officer.

When contacted, DCP Makwana first tried hushing up the matter by terming it to be an internal matter. Later, she expressed her helplessness in being able to address the issue.

She told TOI, “After the water supply department engineers did not respond to our requests, the matter has been brought to the notice of the commissioner of police, who is personally following the matter up with the Aurangabad municipal commissioner.”

The officer said the water supply department authorities have asked to adjust the lines of rest of the city, which too, on an average, gets water once in five days.

An officer privy to the issue said that senior police officers including DCP headquarters is upset as the water supply engineer, who is in charge of the area did not bother to answer her phone calls.

NEW DELHI: “This institution is not hostage of government,” the Supreme Court said on Monday as it sought reply from the Centre on a plea seeking direction to authorities to allow migrant workers across the country to return home after conducting coronavirus tests.The top court's remark came after advocate Prashant Bhushan told the court that the government's view is being blindly considered without verifying it, while fundamental rights of people especially migrant workers are not being enforced.A bench of Justices N V Ramana, Sanjay Kishan Kaul and B R Gavai questioned Bhushan, appearing for petitioners Jagdeep S Chhokar, former director in-charge of IIM, Ahmedabad, and lawyer Gaurav Jain, and said as to why should the court hear him, if he does not have faith in the system.Bhushan said that this is an institution created by Constitution but the fundamental rights are being violated of these migrant workers and I am entitled to express by anguish.The bench told Bhushan, “You don't have faith in judiciary. This institution is not hostage of government.""Clarifying that he never said that he has no faith in this system, Bhushan added he could be wrong but similar opinion is expressed by some retired judges.The bench told him that he claims to be practising in the apex court for past 30 years and then he must know that some orders are favourable and some are not and therefore he should not say such things.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for Centre told Bhushan that he should not be under the impression that he is the only one who is concerned with enforcement of fundamental rights.He said the government is very much concerned with the issue and trying to provide all possible help to migrant workers.Bhushan said that if there was any objection with regard to his appearance as a lawyer in the case, then he was willing to withdraw from the matter and some other lawyer will appear.The bench said that it had never asked him to withdraw from the matter.Bhushan said the central government seems to have shut its eyes and should consider the distress situation faced by the migrant workers during the lockdown.He said that more than 90 per cent migrant workers have not received the ration or wages; they are in desperate situation and should be allowed to go to their native places.Mehta however said that these are incorrect reports and questioned the basis of the data given by the petitioners.He said the Centre is consulting states on the issue as to how many of migrant workers have to be transported, how many have to be given help and what kind of help.The bench told Mehta that it means that Centre is in consultation with states and is ready to examine the issue.Mehta replied that the government is examining everything but the ideas of petitioner are not required and urged the court to not keep the petition pending as there are already several pleas, which have similar prayers.Bhushan urged the court to allow inter-state transportation of migrant workers which was objected to by Mehta saying that it is for the government to look into all aspects keeping the larger interest of people in mind.The solicitor general requested the court to not issue notice and give directions on the plea as it would send wrong message and instead he would file a reply within two weeks.The bench said it is giving one week time to Centre to respond whether there is any proposal on allowing inter-state transportation of migrant workers.Meanwhile, the top court disposed of intervention applications filed by advocate Alakh Alok Srivastava on the issue of stopping inter-state migration of workers and said that it is the Central government to look into the issue.The top court said it is not the coordinating agency between the Centre and states, and the Union government has to take necessary action in this regard.Chhokar and Jain in their plea had said that in wake of the extension of the nationwide lockdown, the migrant workers who are among the worst affected category of people must be allowed to go back to their homes after being tested for Covid-19 It said that those migrant workers who test negative for Covid-19 must not be forcefully kept in shelters or away from their homes and families against their wishes.It said that although the national lockdown has been necessitated because of the unprecedented pandemic of Covid-19 and its imposition is much needed, it is submitted by the petitioners that the fundamental right of the migrant workers enshrined under Article 19(1)(d) (right to move freely throughout India) and Article 19(1)(e) of the Constitution (right to reside and settle in any part of India) cannot be suspended for an indefinite period.It said that these migrant workers cannot be forced to stay away from their families and living in unpredictable and arduous conditions, as the same is an unreasonable restriction beyond what is envisaged under Article 19(5) of the Constitution.The petition said that necessary transport services may be provided by the state governments in abundance so that the purpose of 'social distancing' is not defeated."

A Delhi high court order in April 2017 had said hospitals ‘cannot keep patient hostage’ for unpaid bills

NEW DELHI: Following a surgery , 48-year-old Mohammed Umar was a ‘medical hostage’ for five days in Apollo Spectra Hospital in Kailash Colony . The hospital refused to let him leave till the bill was paid and continued to bill him for the period of his compelled admission.

Umar’s family had made it clear to the hospital at the outset that they could not afford the surgery. The hospital assured them that it would arrange for approval from his insurance company and initially claimed it had got approval. But post-surgery, the management said the insurance company had declined payment, and so they would not let him leave till he paid up.

A Delhi High Court order in April 2017 had said hospitals “cannot keep patient hostage” for unpaid bills.

After a “bladder neck incision” surgery on August 11, Umar was to be discharged the next day. However, he was detained till August 16 when the insurance company’s payment approval came through. Meanwhile, the hospital continued to add Rs 1,000 per day for admission in the general ward.

In response to queries from TOI, an Apollo Spectra spokesperson claimed the patient was not detained and that “at the time of scheduled discharge the insurance company wanted some clarification about the operation. They also wanted to visit the patient in hospital for physical verification. Since the patient was on catheter and not very literate, we took the opportunity of this period for better care of the catheter,” stated the spokesperson. Umar’s son Imran said this was a lie because the insurance agent had already visited them in the hospital on August 10 to verify documents, meet the doctor and take his father’s signature on documents.

Umar, a security guard, had difficulty in passing urine. On Aug 7, he consulted a laparoscopic surgeon who asked him to come to Apollo Spectra Hospital where he operated. The family had already spent Rs 3,000 on investigations including an ultrasound, which revealed bladder outlet obstruction. When informed of the surgery’s cost, Imran told the surgeon they could not afford it. Imran also told him they had an insurance policy. “I repeatedly stressed that we had no money and the hospital staff and the doctor assured me that the surgery would be done only after approval from the insurance company,” said Imran.

On August 10, he was told the approval had come through and Umar was admitted by evening. The surgery was done the next day and Imran was told his father would be discharged on August 12. However, on the 12th, which happened to be Eid, Imran was told the insurance company had declined payment and asked to clear the bill. When Imran called the surgeon for help, he said he was going abroad and there was nothing he could do. He asked Imran to talk to the insurance company. The hospital said the approval process was underway and refused to discharge Umar without payment.

At around 10 pm on August 14, Umar and his wife were forced out of the general ward and made to sit at the reception. “They were told they could not sit around in the ward without paying the bill and were harassed and insulted,” said Imran. Imran rushed back to the hospital on hearing this. When the hospital staff continued to misbehave, he dialled 100. The policemen who arrived warned the hospital and ensured Umar was taken back to the ward. They advised the family to speak to “senior management” the next day.

“But the next day was Independence Day and no seniors were available,” said Imran. He sought help from Malini Aisola of the Campaign for Dignified and Affordable Healthcare who reached the hospital on August 16 with a lawyer. She too was told the patient could not leave till the bill was settled. Finally, the approval came through. “We were told that we have to settle the food bills for August 15 and 16, which we did before we left,” said Imran.

“The hospital was taking advantage of the family’s helplessness and perceived lack of power. In spite of repeatedly being told that detaining the patient was illegal, the hospital did not relent. Patients in such situations are often exploited with insurance company, doctors and hospitals allying against them,” said Aisola.

Umar had sought a copy of his medical records — reports of investigations, doctors’ notes, operative notes and treatment chart. None of these have been given to the patient though he was charged Rs 400 for medical records. Umar had also asked for a detailed breakup of the Rs 61,000 bill for the surgery but this too was not provided. The hospital claimed in its response that in an insurance tie up it had a single line procedure approval inclusive of all charges and that this was given to the patient along with the discharge summary.

PATIALA: A team of the enforcement wing of Punjab State Power Corporation Limited ( PSPCL ), that conducted raids against power theft in Nagra village in Sangrur, was held hostage by local residents for five hours after they disconnected the supply of two domestic consumers for pilferage.

The power corporation team — comprising sub-divisional officers Bhawanigarh, Suburban Sunam and assitant engineer Gharachon — under the supervision of Sangrur senior executive engineer (distribution) carried out a raid in Nagra village where they detected power theft by two consumers using capacitors. The team disconnected their power supply and imposed a fine of Rs 77,978 (Rs 41050 and Rs 36928) on the two.

On their return, the team was gheraoed by farmers’ union members of the village who held them hostage for five hours and pressurized them to install the tampered meters back. They also persuaded them to cancel the action taken against the two consumers. It was not until the local police teams reached the village that the PSPCL team was rescued.

Weeks was met at the airport by Anas Haqqani, who was freed from an Afghan jail in exchange for Weeks' release as well as American Kevin King.

The two men, both professors at the American University of Afghanistan, were kidnapped in the Afghan capital in 2016. They were held by the Haqqani network.

Anas is the younger brother of Sirajuddin Haqqani, the chief of the feared Haqqani network, which is part of the Taliban.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid tweeted a picture of Weeks and Haqqani.

Mujahid tweeted “Timothy Weeks — an Australian professor who was detained by the Islamic Emirate & later released arrived in Doha.”

Weeks was invited to attend by the Taliban, Mujahid said.

Weeks said on his Twitter account: “I cannot believe I am here in Qatar and have met and spoken with Anas. I am blessed to be an official guest at the signing ceremony.”

Although the full list of those attending Saturday's ceremony has not been identified, Pakistan and uneasy neighbour India are both invited as is Russia. It's not clear who will attend from Kabul .

BHOPAL: Amid allegations that a senior power distribution company official was held captive for three hours at Morena ’s Kotwali police station, discom officials on Saturday refrained from work and observed strike in the district. They demanded that the in-charge of the police station where the official was allegedly held captive be suspended.

Around 200 personnel of the power distribution company did not go for work. However, the complaint redressal teams of the discom were kept away from the strike on the first day to ensure that common people do not suffer.

Speaking to TOI, RS Bhadoria, the in-charge of Kotwali police station where the assistant general manager ( AGM ) of the discom’s Morena city circle was allegedly manhandled, said, “Apart from those responsible for addressing faults and complaints, around 200 employees of the discom were on strike.”

According to sources, the employees of the discom plan to continue their strike and would cover the entire Morena district in the next phase.

“As per our plan, it was decided to go on full-fledged strike on second day. But as it is the Republic Day, we have rescheduled it for Monday,” said VKS Parihar, the convener of Madhya Pradesh United Forum for Power Engineers and Employees, an organization of several employee unions working in power sector.

It is noteworthy that the power discom officials and policemen are at loggerheads in Morena town after the AGM was summoned to the Kotwali police station on Wednesday this week and was allegedly held captive for over three hours and pressured to waive off electricity bill worth Rs 1.47 lakh.

After the AGM apprised senor officials, the managing director of the discom Vishesh Gadphale wrote to the state’s director general of police (DGP) while the power engineers’ association met the DGP on Friday following which a strike call was given in Morena.

KATHARIYA VILLAGE (FARRUKHABAD): Subhash Batham, a murder convict who held a fake birthday party for his daughter in UP’s Farrukhabad and then held 25 children who were his “guests” hostage for several hours, was shot dead by police early on Friday morning. His wife, Ruby, who was allegedly an accomplice to the act, died in a hospital soon after after angry local residents pelted her with stones, lynching her. Police on Friday filed an FIR against 300 unknown people under Section 302 (murder).Police, forensic teams and the bomb disposal squad ( Moradabad ) claimed they had recovered 145 crude bombs, including a cylinder bomb and a can bomb, along with wire, battery, tape, sutali (thread) that they said were used in a bomb hurled by Batham during the night, injuring two constables.Twenty live cartridges, 11 used cartridges of a country made pistol and a .315 bore rifle were recovered from his house, police said, along with the used cartridge of an AK-47. Some of the children who had been held hostage had, however, told TOI that they saw only a katta and another country made rifle with Batham.Police said Batham — who never attended school — acquired his “bomb-making skills” during a 12-year stint in jail after he was convicted of murder. The basement in which he held the children hostage doubled up as his laboratory where he painstakingly readied the crude bombs, cops added, suggesting he had been planning his act for a long time.But as far as his motives are concerned, there are different theories — anger at the residents for boycotting him for a long time for marrying a Dalit woman, allegedly being left out of government schemes, and enmity against those who testified against him in court in the murder case.According to police, Batham had claimed on the night of the incident that the gram pradhan of Kathariya village and a local MLA had falsely implicated him in his uncle’s murder due to which he had ended up wasting his youth in prison. The gram pradhan, Harvir Singh, told TOI that he indeed testified in court against Batham and that’s why the man held enmity against him. “Batham murdered his uncle in 2001 after he had caught him stealing valuables from a neighbour’s house and scolded him. I was a witness in the case.”Commenting on a letter that Batham had written to authorities — demanding a house and toilet under government schemes — and which he handed to police on Thursday night, the gram pradhan said his demands were baseless. “He had written the letter for a house under the PM Awas Yojana and a toilet under the Swachh Bharat Mission years ago.” The real motive, he insisted, was revenge against him and village residents.Bhojpur MLA Nagendra Singh — who was also the target of Batham’s fury — said that he didn’t know the man but had visited the spot to defuse the situation. “He wanted revenge as he was boycotted by the community for marrying a Dalit woman four years ago,” he said.SP (Farrukhabad) Anil Kumar Mishra said, “The hostage situation could have been created to extort money as he demanded Rs 1 crore for each kid. He also wanted all criminal cases expunged against him.” Batham had five criminal cases going on against him in local courts.Whatever the motive, he was well-prepared, claimed police. “The quantity of bombs was good enough to kill everyone in a radius of 50 metres if they went off at once,” said Farrukhabad special operation group in charge Dinesh Kumar Gautam .Batham was shot even as the crowd of 300 pelted stones at their house. “As they were attacking the couple at the front door, we entered the house from the back. When he saw his wife being attacked, he grabbed his country made rifle after which he was shot dead,” said Mishra.Some residents, however, alleged that policemen “encouraged local residents to pelt stones at the couple”. On Friday, the couple’s bodies were sent for autopsy, while their two and a half year old daughter Kusum was handed over to child authorities.In Video: UP Police rescue all 23 kids kept hostage in Farrukhabad, suspect shot down"

SANTINIKETAN: BJP Rajya Sabha member and writer Swapan Dasgupta was forcibly confined to an auditorium at Visva-Bharati in Santiniketan for almost five hours on Wednesday as students protesting against the new citizenship law stood outside, shouting slogans and refusing to let him leave.

Dasgupta had vice-chancellor Bidyut Chakrabarty for company inside the auditorium, whose collapsible gate was locked from outside by the protesters.

After his ordeal ended, Dasgupta tweeted: ""Drama ends in Visva-Bharati without the confrontation that some protesters desperately wanted.""

The siege was reminiscent of the hostility Union minister Babul Supriyo had faced from students at Jadavpur University when he visited the campus for an event on September 19. But unlike Supriyo, who was allegedly manhandled, Dasgupta apparently didn't face any violence.

""How does it feel to have a mob attack a peaceful meeting on CAA ...? This is what is happening to a meeting I am addressing at Visva Bharati now. Locked into room now with a howling mob outside, itching for confrontation,"" Dasgupta had tweeted from captivity after some students allegedly scaled a wall and shouted slogans through the windows.

The gherao at Visva-Bharati started around 4.30pm and was lifted at 9.25pm, minutes after governor Jagdeep Dhankhar contacted DGP Virendra. ""Such anarchy and failure of law and order are worrisome,"" Dhankhar tweeted.

During the protest against Supriyo at JU, the governor had rushed to the south Kolkata campus to escort him out of the campus. ""I had come on an invitation from the university to speak at a lecture series on CAA. This was not a political forum. If someone does this, it only reflects an attitude that goes against the principles of democratic thinking. I had expected the students to participate in the seminar and oppose CAA. It could have been a healthy discussion. Initially, the seminar was planned at Lipika auditorium. But later, the venue was shifted because I was told there were chances of confrontation. But we didn't want any confrontation,"" Dasgupta said.

Somnath Sow, an SFI leader, accused vice-chancellor Chakrabarty of precipitating the stand-off. ""The VC organised the seminar on a day the entire country was protesting against CAA-NPR-NRC. He invited Swapan Dasgupta as the sole speaker at the seminar,"" he said.

The protesters had assembled at the university's central office hours before the scheduled start of the seminar at 10.30am, locking the gates and hanging posters bearing slogans against PM Narendra Modi and CAA. At 2pm, they moved to the main entrance of the auditorium and blocked the gate before Dasgupta arrived to speak at 3pm. Sensing the mood, the university authorities shifted the venue to an auditorium on the Sriniketan campus, about a kilometre away.

The protesters came to know about the venue change 45 minutes later and reached there at 4.30pm. Around 6pm, Visva-Bharati officials tried to persuade the students to disperse, but they wouldn't listen.

Suchitra Bhattacharya, a professor in the department of economics and politics, said the situation could have been avoided. ""We had urged the VC to shift the seminar to a different date and invite a panel of speakers instead of just one. The VC didn't pay heed to our request. He only invited Dasgupta.""

With the stir continuing into the night, Trinamool functionaries started sending feelers to the Visva-Bharati protesters that being a central university, the CISF was in charge of its security. ""While the VC didn't call CISF to clear the protesters, there was a chance of disturbance and confrontation from the outside,"" a Trinamool leader said.

BJP national secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya said in a video message: ""Our Rajya Sabha member Swapan Dasgupta is being held up at Visva-Bharati for hours. Police haven't taken steps as yet. If anything happens to the MP, things will get out of control.""

The two Taliban hostages (AP image)

WASHINGTON: The US on Tuesday welcomed the release of two hostages by the Taliban in Afghanistan , describing it a hopeful sign for efforts to end the decades-long conflict in the country.

American Kevin King and Australian Timothy Weeks, both professors at the American University in Kabul, were kidnapped at gunpoint in August 2016. Both men were successfully recovered on Tuesday and are currently receiving medical care and other support from the United States Government.

""Both men were successfully recovered this morning, are in the care of the US military, and will soon be reunited with their loved ones,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said.

""We pray for the full recovery of both men, who endured significant hardship during their captivity, and wish them well as they reunite with their loved ones in the near future,” White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said.

In a statement, Pompeo said the Taliban have indicated that the release of the two professors is intended as a goodwill gesture, which the United States welcomes.

""Additionally, we welcome the Taliban's impending release of 10 Afghan prisoners, and the Afghan government's release of 3 Taliban prisoners. We see these developments as hopeful signs that the Afghan war, a terrible and costly conflict that has lasted 40 years, may soon conclude through a political settlement,"" Pompeo said.

Both Pompeo and the White House commended Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and the Afghan government for working to strengthen and reform Afghanistan's security forces.

""During the past two years, President Ghani extended an offer to talk to the Taliban without preconditions. He also called for a ceasefire during the Muslim holiday of Eid-ul-Fitr in 2018, which the Taliban reciprocated. The public's grateful reaction to that interruption in the violence dramatically illustrated their overwhelming desire for peace,” he said.

AGRA: Four days after a murder convict was shot dead by police to rescue 25 children, a man who tried to mediate during the nine-hour-long stand-off claimed on Tuesday that the abductor wanted punishment for two policemen who “tortured him” in custody in a theft case and sought “sexual favours” from his wife in lieu of his release.

When contacted, senior district police officials rejected the charges, but assured a probe into the allegation and the role of the two policemen.

Subhash Batham was shot dead on Friday while his wife died hours later on way to hospital after being attacked by locals in Farrukhabad ’s Kathariya village. Batham had organised a birthday party for his daughter and then held 25 children hostage on Thursday.

On Tuesday, when TOI contacted Anupam Dubey alias Balloo, who was shot at by Batham while trying to negotiate peace, said: “During my interaction with Batham, he accused two Farrukhabad police constables of torturing him in custody. He also alleged that the policemen had also asked for sexual favours from his wife in lieu of his release in a theft case.”

Dubey was approached by Bhojpur MLA Nagendra Singh to talk to Batham during the stand-off. “Everyone present there heard Batham but no one did anything. The entire drama was set up to attract administration’s attention to punish those two policemen,” said Dubey.

Additional superintendent of police Tribhuwan Singh said, “Batham planned the entire situation for months to extort money. He demanded Rs 1 crore for each child taken hostage. He constructed a basement in his house months ago and also gathered explosives to target policemen.”

MEERUT: A three-member team for administering polio drops was allegedly thrashed and held hostage after local residents mistook them for the National Population Register (NPR) data collection team. The incident occurred at Lisari Gate locality on Saturday. However, two of them, including a staff nurse, managed to free themselves and complained to police.

Lisari Gate station officer Prashant Kapil said, “We have received the complaint from the medical team and we are in the process of filing an FIR against the culprits for stopping public servants from performing their duty. This is not the first time that such an incident has happened in the area.”

According to one of victims Kabir Ahmad Khan, who is an officer of the immunization programme, “The incident occurred in Lakhipura locality of Lisari Gate area where a family opposed the administration of polio drops. As per rule, we have to enter the name of the non-consenting parents in the tally (yellow) register. The moment we asked their names, there was a strong protest and within no time, we were surrounded by a mob. We tried to explain them the purpose of our visit. We even showed them the vaccine box and our IDs, but they didn't listen to us and even manhandled one of our team members. They tore away the register and the local women even held hostage a woman staffer in our team. Later, senior staff along with the WHO field monitors also reached the spot and again tried to explain things to them.”

Khan said, “The NPR-NRC anxiety among them is obviously the main issue because one of the youths in the mob even told people not to reveal any details to us because he suspected we were the NPR data collectors . Ever since this issue came up, we have been facing very tough resistance from the local residents. But this time, they turned violent.”

Bhopal: The power discom officials and policemen are at loggerheads in Morena town after an additional general manager of the discom was summoned to the Kotwali police station on January 22 and held captive for over three hours and pressured to waive off electricity bill worth Rs 1.47 lakh.

After the AGM apprised senor officials, the managing director of the discom Vishesh Gadphale wrote to the state’s director general of police while the power engineers’ association met the DGP on Friday and gave a strike call in Morena on Saturday.

Kotwali police station incharge, Kaushlendra Bhadoria however denied the allegations.

AGM of MP Madhya Kshetra Vidyut Vitaran Company’s, Morena city circle Rajesh Singh Bhadoria while talking to TOI said, “I was in office at around 11 am when four policemen came to me saying that TI Kotwali has summoned me. When I enquired in what connection, the cops told me it was related to some power bill. I informed my senior officials and went to the police station with a colleague in the police jeep.

At the police station, I was shown a bill and the police station in-charge asked me to waive off the bill, instructing his subordinates not to let me go. On verification, it was found that the bill had already been waived in the past. Then the police station in-charge asked his colleagues to not to let me go and came up with another bill of Rs 1.47 lakh after an hour and half. On checking the details, it was known that the consumer had not paid a single month electricity bill ever since he took the connection which was informed to the SHO. Later, at around 2.30 pm, someone called the SHO, and he asked to sign a receipt of application wherein it was written that an application was given for rectification of power bill. I wrote everything that had happened on which he snatched the paper and let us go.”

“After coming out I informed senior officials about the treatment meted out and informed our association office bearers. Action should be taken against him,” he said.

Denying the allegations, SHO Kaushlendra Bhadoria told TOI, “more than a dozen employees of police lines have been receiving inflated power bills. Bills as much as Rs 1.47 lakh are generated, but despite attempts no officer was paying heed for rectification.

“So, he was summoned. He came on his own and also left the police station on his own. No one forced him. He told us that he cannot rectify without seeing records and he needs time and left the police station,” he added.

Convener of the Madhya Pradesh Vidyut Mandal Abhiyanta Sangh VKS Parihar said, “We have met the DGP and apprised him of the situation. He had assured us of appropriate action. In the meantime, we have called for a strike in Morena town on Saturday. On Sunday, the strike would be extended to Morena district if no action is taken against the police official.”

SRIGANGANAGAR/BIKANER: Locusts have damaged crops across an area of at least 3.6 lakh hectares in 10 districts as western Rajasthan continues to reel under the longest and the worst attack of the pest in 60 years.Swirling swarms of the deadly grasshoppers have eaten up 75% of standing crops in the hardest-hit Sriganganagar district, according to assessments by officials and farmers. The other nine affected districts are Hanumangarh, Bikaner, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Jodhpur, Jalore, Sirohi, Nagaur and Churu.The first attacks were reported in May last year, when lakhs of pink locusts flying in from southern Pakistan damaged the kharif crop (July-Sept) in the 10 districts. Now, a major wave of fresh attacks have hit the rabi crop (October-March), leaving farmers devastated.Locals in 60 villages of Sriganganagar and Bikaner visited by TOI said the latest attacks began a fortnight ago.Many farmers said the current attack is the biggest ever seen in the region.Among the crops in the line of attack are wheat, gram, mustard, cumin and taramira (arugula). “Locusts are not eating the entire plant but are chewing the flowers, thereby damaging the crop,” said Shyam Somra of 20KYD village in Bikaner district.“Rajasthan witnessed first locust attack in May 2019 and since then, everyone — including the agriculture department, Locust Control Organisation (LCO) and others — has been merely spraying pesticides. This is the biggest-ever attack. Can’t they find out why the attack is still unstoppable and uncontrollable? If breeding is happening in Pakistan, the state administration should urge the Union government to talk to their Pakistani counterparts to control it,” said Subash Sehgal of Kisan Sangarsh Samiti.K L Gurjar, deputy director at LCO-Jodhpur, has been surveying the damage in villages of Sriganganagar and Bikaner districts. “I think the menace is under control in the state, except for Sriganganagar and Jaisalmer districts. A good monsoon, greenery and moisture have been the reasons behind the excessive presence of locusts this year. We have ample pesticides and are checking their movement to control them while they are settled in non-farming areas,” Gurjar told TOI. Farmers alleged that for the last eight months, the state government had neither completed girdawari (cross assessment report), nor had it taken any effective measures to check the swarms of locusts coming at regular intervals.“I have 75 bighas of land and ever since we witnessed fresh locust attack a fortnight ago, we have been spraying pesticides, playing loud music and doing everything to scare away these devils.

KABUL: Forty-three residents of Khwaja Omri district in the southern Afghan province of Ghazni, who were abducted by the Taliban two days ago, have been released following mediation by tribal elders, the provincial governor's office said on Sunday.

Last month, at least six media persons, working for private and government media organisations here, were abducted by the Taliban in Zurmat district in the eastern Afghan province of Paktia.

Quoting sources, Tolo News reported that the journalists, working for radio and TV news companies that broadcast news in Pashto and Dari languages, were abducted while travelling to Paktia to attend a media workshop on Friday.

The terror group has reportedly claimed that it kidnapped the journalists ""mistakenly"" and promised to release them soon.

The incidents have come at a time when US President Donald Trump called off peace negotiations with the Taliban after the group claimed responsibility for the Kabul car bombing which killed 12 people, including an American soldier.

US Special Representative for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad met Taliban leader in Pakistan this week. Regarding the meeting on Thursday that lasted for more than an hour, Kabul has said that talks in Islamabad between a Taliban delegation and Pakistauthorities were about the release of two hostages and not on the resumption of the peace process, Tolo News reported.

LUCKNOW: In a daring incident, a group of five robbers stormed the house of a retired IAS officer , held him and his daughter hostage at gunpoint and committed loot in Indiranagar on Monday noon.

They looted Rs 40,000 cash and jewellery and valuables worth Rs 10 lakh. Police suspect the role of their domestic aide and have launched a manhunt to arrest him and his suspected aides.

The victim, Raj Kishore, is a retired IAS officer and is the former chairman of Uttar Pradesh Subordinate Service Selection Commission (UPSSSC). He resides with his daughter Kumari Prashasti in house number 17/11 Indiranagar near Munshipulia crossing in Indiranagar. He also runs an optical centre in his house.

Kishore said he was reading a newspaper while his daughter Prashasti (24) was in another room when the incident took place, said the police.

Around 1.30pm, five miscreants barged into his house and trained a gun at him. They tied Kishore with a rope and entered the room in which Prashasti was studying. They tied her with a sheet and pasted a tape on her mouth. They also held Kishore's domestic help Mukesh and tied him.

""They rummaged through each and every corner of the house,"" Kishore said.

In the meantime, Kishore's neighbour Vineet Dubey heard noises and immediately rushed to Kishore's house, said the police. By then, the robbers had fled. Dubey set Kishore and his daughter free and informed the police.

Units of dog squad and forensic science laboratory also visited the spot.

Circle officer (Ghazipur) Tanu Upadhyay said CCTV footage had been accessed and showed that soon after the robbery, Mukesh was the first one to run after the gang on a bicycle. He has been missing since.

""Footage also shows that before the robbery, Mukesh entered the house and left the gate open. Two minutes later, the robbers entered the house,"" Upadhyay said.

She also added that Mukesh had been employed in January and had not shared his residential address or other details with Kishore.

""We have registered a dacoity case. Efforts are on to catch the miscreants,"" she said.

No arrests in Sarita Vihar robbery

NEW DELHI: An 80-year-old woman and her daughter were drugged, gagged, manhandled and held hostage at gunpoint in their Sarita Vihar house by their newly employed domestic help and two men who then ransacked the house of cash and jewellery worth several lakhs. Later, the two fell unconscious and had to be hospitalised.The daughter, an employee of a private firm, said she hired the help on August 31, two days before the incident, through a placement agency to take care of her mother who had undergone a knee replacement surgery. “Though the girl was initially rejected by us, the agency insisted we keep her for trial for three days, claiming she was an excellent worker,” the daughter told TOI.Police were yet to arrest anyone though the incident had taken place a week ago.TOI is withholding the identity of the mother and daughter as they have requested anonymity for their own security.Sharing the ordeal, the daughter told that on September 2, soon after having lunch prepared by the domestic help, she and her mother went to rest in their room. However, she was woken up by some noise. She saw the help ransacking the house along with the two men, who were armed with a khukri and a pistol. The three attacked her and asked her where the valuables were, warning her she would otherwise be shot.After this, one of the robbers stood guard with a gun while the others went to all the bedrooms, ransacked the entire house and took away all valuables. They also took away the DVR of CCTV cameras installed in the house.“It was only after they had left that I was somehow able to dial 100. By the time police arrived, we were both unconscious from the effects of the sedative which was mixed in the lunch,” the daughter said, adding that she also suffered injuries on her head. The blood reports from hospital also indicated the presence of drugs, police said.In Video: 80-year-old, daughter held hostage, robbed in Delhi's Sarita Vihar"

During a rescue operation, four cops sustained injuries as the godman’s followers pelted stones on them. The accused Peer Baba and his family members were detained.Block medical officer of Chadoora subdistrict hospital, Dr Shafakat Rasool , had deputed the team to screen the Peer Baba in Sheikhpora’s Wathoora village after receiving information from residents of other villages that his followers would visit him regularly violating social distancing norms amid the nationwide lockdown in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. She was also informed that the godman’s son had travel history.“As soon as our medical team reached the village and entered the godman’s house to examine him, the latter’s family members held the four hostages and even hurled abuses at one of our women doctors who was part of the team. The medical staff called us for help and we immediately alerted police who rushed to their rescue,” Dr Shafakat said.When policemen reached the village to launch a rescue operation, they were chased by the Peer Baba’s followers who, in a bid to deter the exercise, pelted stones on the rescue party. In the ensuing melee, four cops sustained injuries even as the medical team was rescued timely, a police officer said. Chadoora Police detained the godman and his family members and booked them under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) of the IPC.“It is equally encouraging that residents of other villages informed the hospital about the violation of the standard operating procedure and the travel history of the accused’s son,” Dr Shafakat added."

Videos have emerged of three Indian men locked up in a room and speaking in Hindi with a Haryanvi accent

AMBALA: A number of videos of Indians, purportedly of illegal immigrants wanting to unlawfully cross over to the United States through the Mexico border, have emerged in which they are seen being tortured by unidentified men and forced at gunpoint to ask their families to transfer money. In the videos with TOI, three Indian men, seen locked up in a room, are heard speaking in Hindi with a Haryanvi accent.

Two Spanish-speaking men, with their faces covered, are seen assaulting them at gunpoint. Holding a sword-like sharp weapon on their necks, the men are heard asking the Indians to tell their parents to send money as soon as possible. “Money, money… Last warning,” they shout at the Indians.

The identities of these Indians have yet not been established and any information about their whereabouts is also unknown. In one of the videos, an Indian youth is heard saying, “Mom and dad, give them money or they will kill us. I beg in front of you, please give them the amount of money they are demanding. They are demanding $10,000 and give them the same.” On October 18, 311 Indians were deported from Mexico after the US government tightened its rules and asked Mexican authorities to thwart illegal entry into the US.

These videos have been obtained from several of those who were among the 311 Indians to be deported from Mexico. “The donkers (agents) abroad had tortured them mentally and physically,” one of the deportees said. Requesting anonymity, he told TOI, “The agents in India promised to settle me and my brother in the US for Rs 30 lakh.

We paid Rs 25.50 lakh in advance and they took us on a journey towards the US. They took us through aerial route from New Delhi to Quito in Ecuador and then we were made to travel through illegal passage via Tulcan, Turbo, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua , Honduras , Guatemala, and Mexico. “In Turbo, Colombia , we were locked in a room and taken on gunpoint and forced to ask our parents to pay the remaining amount of Rs 4.5 lakh to their associated agents in India. My parents went to the house of that agent and paid the remaining amount.”"

MADURAI: A 69-year-old woman from Thirumangalam near Madurai died hours after resisting a neighbour’s attempt to snatch her gold chain even as she was stabbed and taken hostage in the process.

D Kaveri of Annakamuthottam died of injuries early on Wednesday in a hospital. A Kadhershah Oli, the accused, has been arrested. Kaveri was staying alone in her house since her husband Durairaj died. She was running a shop selling petty things in the house, while her adopted son D Sakthirajan, 33, was staying separately in the town. On Tuesday, Oli, from the same area, approached Kaveri on the pretext of purchasing some items from the shop. Suddenly, he tried to snatch her gold chain weighing five sovereigns. Kaveri recovered from the shock and put up a fight. He whipped out a knife and attacked Kaveri on her hand and neck.

As she raised an alarm, people from the neighbouring houses rushed in and surrounded Oli. Cornered and fearing that he will be beaten up, the accused quickly dragged the woman inside the house and held her hostage. When the people tried to enter the house, he opened an LPG cylinder and threatened to light it if anyone approached him. At this, the people backed off and alerted police as well as fire and rescue personnel.

A fire and rescue team as well as police rushed in and managed to enter the house. While the fire personnel stopped the LPG leak, police overpowered Oli. Though the injured woman was rushed to the hospital, she died. A postmortem examination was conducted later and a murder case registered based on a complaint from Sakthirajan.

ISLAMABAD: A Pakistani court on Thursday overturned the death sentence of Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh , the British-born terrorist who had been convicted of the 2002 kidnapping and killing of American journalist Daniel Pearl and, before that, spent time in an Indian jail till he was bartered for the hostages of the 1999 Kandahar hijacking.

The Sindh high court converted Sheikh’s death penalty into a seven-year jail term and acquitted his three accomplices – Fahad Naseem, Salman Saqib and Sheikh Adil – who had been sentenced to life imprisonment by a trial court.

Since Sheikh has been in prison for the past 18 years, his seven-year sentence will be counted from the time he was jailed. ""Omar has already spent 18 years in jail, 11 years more than the punishment given to him. His release orders will be issued soon and he will be out in a few days,"" Khwaja Naveed Ahmed, Sheikh’s counsel, told TOI.

In 2002, an anti-terrorism court at Hyderabad in Sindh province had handed the death sentence to Sheikh, a close associate of Jaish-e-Muhammad founder Maulana Masood Azhar , and life term to his accomplices in the abduction and murder of Pearl. The four convicts challenged the decision in the high court. At a hearing last month, the court reserved its judgment on the appeals that were pending before it for the past 18 years.

Pearl, who was the South Asia bureau chief of The Wall Street Journal, went missing in January 2002 from the southern port city of Karachi. The US authorities received video footage of his beheading at the American consulate in Karachi. His body was later found in a militant hideout in the port city.

Prosecutors said Pearl walked into Sheikh’s trap after being promised an interview with a cleric linked to militancy. Sheikh’s association with jihadist activity dated back to the early 1990s. In 1994, he had been arrested in Delhi for allegedly kidnapping four westerners, including three Britons and an American, from Kashmir.

In 1999, while he was still serving a prison sentence, an Indian Airlines plane was hijacked from Kathmandu to Kandahar in Afghanistan. In exchange for the 155 hostages on the plane, Sheikh was freed from jail along with Massod Azhar and Mushtaq Zargar, a Kashmiri militant.

Before coming to India to fight for Kashmiri Muslims, Sheikh had been involved in jihadist activity in Bosnia. Born in a conservative London-based Muslim family in 1973, he had dropped out of an undergraduate course in statistics at the London School of Economics to go to Bosnia.

While they locked him inside, they took his wife, Amarjeet Kaur, out and punched her in the nose, and took her gold earrings.

Gurmail alleged that the miscreants also hit his mother, Gurdev Kaur. He added that his neighbour Balbir Singh, who had come to their rescue, was also manhandled by the accused persons and he suffered an injury in the melee.

The accused then ran away from the house. A case of robbery has been registered at Jamalpur police station. Sahnewal assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Harjinder Singh Gill said the house did not have a CCTV camera, but they had got footage of a CCTV in the area and were scanning it.

ACP confirmed that two persons had suffered injuries in the incident.

Police said the value of the robbed goods was yet to be calculated as the family was still in shock. Police said the accused, who had masked their faces, had come to the crime spot on foot. They added that preliminary investigation suggested that they reached the house at around 1.15am and left by 1.30am.

As she lay bleeding for hours, Rohit Singh aka Regal indulged in video chats with reporters and police, went live on Facebook with grisly images of the injured girl, demanding they be “shared maximum”, and kept police dancing to his music.Late at night, it turned out that he had plotted it after watching a movie the woman had acted in, say police.Like Bollywood script — the industry he claims to work for — he played his moves and dragged out the crisis exactly as long as he wanted, giving himself up a little after 7pm.The hostage was rescued and admitted to hospital. She gave a statement to police, saying she was threatened at gunpoint. “I had no option but to agree to marry him. But I don’t want to,” she told police.And in an example of how police messed up the entire operation, SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha told reporters after the rescue: “They are in love and want to marry. There’s nothing wrong in that. They are adults. But the process he (Rohit) used is wrong.” This was after she had been rescued and he didn’t have to play-act to Rohit as earlier.Police allowed Rohit the upper hand by fulfilling all his demands.

BJP workers in front of Congress city headquarters on Saturday

KOLKATA: Trouble brewed at the Congress headquarters at Bidhan Bhavan on Saturday after a group of BJP supporters allegedly tore off a flex of Rahul Gandhi, demanding an apology from the Congress leader for his ‘ Chowkidar Chor Hai’ remarks. The protest brought the entire area to a standstill with CR Avenue remaining blocked for close to an hour in the afternoon.

A BJP rally that had originated from Ramlila Maidan was passing by Bidhan Bhavan when some of the youths suddenly approached the Congress headquarters gates and started creating a ruckus. A 70-year-old who was standing near the Bidhan Bhavan gate was allegedly assaulted. The group also allegedly threw stones at Bidhan Roy’s statue.

Congress supporters who were at the place alleged that the BJP men also raised ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogans and went on a rampage. A huge police force reached the spot to bring the situation under control. Later, around a hundred Congress supporters staged an agitation near the BJP headquarters at Central Avenue, which created traffic snarls on Central Avenue for some time before police managed to disperse the mob.

About 50 sarpanches from Mansa reached CM’s house with Cong district chief Manoj Bala

PATIALA: A day after they held an additional deputy commissioner (ADC) hostage in his office after a controversy broke out over distribution of sewing machines to the needy, nearly 50 sarpanches of the Congress from Mansa reached the New Moti Bagh residence of chief minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday to meet Patiala MP Preneet Kaur.

The sarpanches had confined ADC (development) to his office on Friday, after they alleged that the authorities were favouring people associated with MLA Nazar Singh Manshahia, who defeceted from AAP to Congress before Lok Sabha polls, in the distribution of sewing machine macghines. They claimed that names of beneficiaries whose list they had handed over to authorities had not been included in the list.

The ADC was freed after intervention by an SP-rank official, who later gave a written complaint to Mansa police chief. Employees of the panchayat department went on a strike after the incident. Led by Mansa District Congress Comittee president Manoj Bala, the Congress sarpanches claimed in their meeting with the MP that Mansa deputy commissioner, ADC and panchayat officers were indulging in corruption and ignoring local Congress leaders.

Bala said they officials were acting at the behest of Akali leaders and issues being raised by Congress leaders were being overlooked. She said some local officials were indulging in corruption and demanded that they be transferred out of Mansa. She told TOI that Preneet gave them a patient hearing to them and assured them she would take up the matter with chief minister Amarinder Singh.

Mansa administration on Friday organized an event to distribute sewing machines and rickshaws to poor SC families under the Centre’s Special Assistance Scheme where Manshahia was the chief guest. The sarpanches and other local leaders got upset when they noticed that “those associated with Manshahia were being given priority” in the distribution of machines.

They accused the ADC (development) of “step-motherly” treatment. They also brought the matter to the notice of Bala, who reached the spot. She asked the officials to address the grievances of the Congress sarpanches, but later she ended up arguing with them. It led to sloganeering at the event and the event turned into chaos. As the protesting Congress workers were raising slogans, the ADC (D) went to his office, where the sarpanches held him hostage.

Later, SP Kuldeep Singh Sohi and DSP Baljinder Singh Pannu rushed to the spot and persuaded the protesters to lift the dharna.

COLVA: Chief officer of Margao Municipal Council (MMC) Siddivinayak Naik has lodged a police complaint against Ashraf Pandiyal and others for wrongfully restraining him in his cabin for two hours and obstructing him from carrying out his lawful duties.

However, Margao police inspector (PI) Sachin Narvekar said the case is yet to be registered.

On Tuesday morning, 40-odd Gandhi market traders led by Rajendra Azgaonkar called on chairperson Babita Prabhudessai and Naik to urge them to immediately resolve their pending issues, including that of vendors selling fruits and vegetables from vehicles which hampers local vendors’ business.

The traders told Prabhudessai and Naik that it was earlier decided that other vendors could do business in the Gandhi market till 7.30am, but due to lack of monitoring on the part of the MMC these outside vendors conducted their business in the Gandhi market and also on the old station road, which was causing them losses.

They demand that the illegal activity of outside vendors carrying on business at the market beyond the agreed time be stopped.

The delegation also brought to the notice of the chief officer that after 9am water supply to toilets in the Gandhi market is stopped, inconveniencing vendors who want to use the toilet facilities. There should be continuous water supply at the market, the delegation told Naik and Prabhudessai.

Members of the association also told Naik that some vendors are yet to receive power connections and that the matter be rectified. They cited the resolution adopted in 2001 by the council stating that all vendors would be given power connections.

Naik told the traders that the resolution did not have legal weightage as the market committee had adopted the resolution and not the council. He said he would refer the matter to the Directorate of Municipal Administration.

Aggrieved by the reply the traders returned to Naiks’ cabin at 6pm and demanded that he issue NOCs to the rest of the vendors for power supply.

One of the traders Ashraf Pandiyal told reporters that they had proof that Naik has issued NOCs to four traders earlier and was now changing his stand.

Naik denied having issued any NOCs.

He said that issuing NOCs based on the market committee’s resolution is ‘ultra vires’ as that resolution has to be endorsed by the standing committee and then ratified by the council resolution and that only then NOCs can be issued.

Manish Kumar Jha

GHAZIABAD: A 43-year-old executive of an auto component manufacturing company was allegedly robbed of Rs 1.15 lakh and a gold ring by a cab driver and three of his accomplices after he took the taxi from Ghaziabad railway station for his Greater Noida residence late on Sunday night.

Manish Kumar Jha, the safety head of Spark Minda in Rewari, was allegedly held hostage at gunpoint for three hours and thrashed by his co-riders, forcing him to reveal his ATM card pin. Later the four withdrew Rs 1 lakh from his account.

They also snatched his wallet containing Rs 15,000, mobile phone charger, earphone, and new clothes and some fruits he had bought, before dumping him near a school in Vijay Nagar in the early hours of Monday.

Santosh Kumar Jha, his younger brother, told TOI that Manish was returning from Patna on Sunday. “Seemanchal Express was supposed to reach Ghaziabad around 9.30 pm but it was delayed by three hours. After getting down from the train, he took a cab from outside, but missed noticing a person sitting inside,” he said.

“As soon as he boarded the cab, the driver stepped on the gas pedal. Within no time, the person sitting next to the driver pointed a gun at him. A little later, two other persons boarded the vehicle and made my brother sit in the middle. They had guns and knives and started beating my brother. He was forced to part with his debit cards and the passwords. They mainly hit him on his hands and knees,” Santosh added.

The ordeal continued for over three hours. Around 3.30am, Manish was thrown out of the vehicle near Jindal Public School. In a badly bruised condition, he sought help from a passerby who told him to wait for the police patrolling vehicle. After covering a considerable distance on foot, Manish finally spotted a police patrolling bike and narrated the crime to cops.

Based on his complaint, an FIR under IPC 392 (robbery) was lodged at Vijay Nagar police station.

SP (city) Shlok Kumar said teams have been formed to investigate the case. “Noida police have also been informed as money was withdrawn from Noida ATMs as well,” he said.

Similar crimes were reported in Ghaziabad in March this year too. A 30-year-old dentist was robbed by four persons in an auto-rickshaw, including the vehicle driver, while she was returning from her clinic in Vaishali. She was thrashed and kept inside the moving vehicle for around 45 minutes. They had gagged her mouth after blindfolding her and tying her hands and legs with ropes.

MYSURU: The incident of a 15-year-old schoolgirl being held hostage and raped by five different men for over five months in the city has sent shockwaves across the district.

The girl was forcefully taken away by a moneylender on January 7 as the girl’s mother failed to repay a loan . Five people, including the moneylender Padhma, have been booked under various sections of IPC and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (Pocso).

A police constable, who is friend of Padhma, too, was allegedly involved in the crime. But he has not been named in the FIR. An IPC section (whoever being a police officer commits rape ), however, has been included in the FIR and a probe is under way.

Police commissioner K T Balakrishna told TOI that two people have been arrested and search is on for other accused.

“The incident has left the family in a state of shock with the survivor ’s father attempting suicide after learning about the experience his daughter had to undergo at the hands of the moneylender and her friends. The family is feeling threatened,” a child activist claimed.

On the other side, the incident has also exposed the practice of lending money at high rates of interest that is going on unabated. Sources claimed that the girl’s mother had taken Rs 3 lakh from Padhma, her friend, to fend for her treatment on weekly interest. As the family failed to pay the money back, Padhma forcefully took away her daughter, a class IX student.

The girl was rescued with the help of Odanadi Seva Samsthe on June 6 and an FIR was filed on June 10.

The other accused in the case are Prasanna, Vinodh, a lecturer, Ravi and Vicky.

Procedures not followed: Forum

Odanadi Seva Samsthe director L Parashuram told TOI that the girl’s mother had approached them and subsequently they met senior police officers seeking help. “We were kept away from the rescue operation by Kuvempunagar police who rescued the girl and sent her with parents. A day later the girl’s family again approached us following which we took them to the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), a quasi-judicial body, which took cognizance of the case and handed over the girl’s custody to us,” he said.

The same day police took the survivor from Odanadi for a medical test and then to the judge for recording statements. After the procedures were completed, police didn’t bring back the girl to Odanadi. Officials claimed that the girl expressed her wish of going with her parents before the judge and she was again sent with her mother.

Parashuram said the jurisdictional police did not follow procedures and threw the laws governing children and rape survivors to wind. “We have explained the development to CWC and are awaiting their directive,” he added.

CWC chairperson Kamala H T said, “We have sent the girl to Odanadi, but the childcare and protection institution has written to us about the developments. The case will be taken up for hearing on Friday.”

GURUGRAM: A cash collection van of a Delhi-based private company was robbed of Rs 17 lakh by three armed assailants, after taking the driver hostage at gunpoint in Sector 29 market on Monday.

According to the police, the cash van belongs to Radiant Cash Management Services that has its office in Jhandewalan in New Delhi. The company works as a cash collecting agent that helps establishments get their money deposited to the bank count by paying a fee to the company.

On Monday, the cashier of the company along with Dinesh Bharti — the driver — were on the duty of collecting money from different clients. “After collecting cash from Dwarka and Najafgarh, we had reached the Sector 29 market in Gurugram to collect cash from Croma Centre. The cashier had gone inside and I was waiting in the van that was parked on the roadside. Suddenly three men arrived in a car and held me hostage at gunpoint. They snatched the cash bag from the van and fled,” Dinesh told police.

A PCR call was made and a team from Sector 29 police station immediately reached the spot and started scanning the CCTV footage of the area to identify the accused.

“Maybe the accused were following the van from some distance and attacked the driver after the cashier went inside the market. Role of an insider cannot be ruled out as the entire episode appears to be a well-planned one. We are recording the statement of the two to understand the sequence of events,” said a senior officer adding that there was no security guard in the van and cash bag too was not kept inside any enclosed area.

Police spokesperson Subhash Boken said on the basis of the complaint a case has been registered at Sector 29 police station.

BIJNOR: Residents of Bijnor ’s Naiwala village held forest officials hostage on Sunday, demanding security for themselves and their livestock after a leopard killed and partially devoured a colt there. For some time, a stray leopard has been prowling around in the area, posing a threat to several villages but forest department authorities has made no efforts to catch it, they claimed. The villagers said they could not go on living in constant fear while forest department did nothing to protect them.

According to villagers, on the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday, a leopard entered human inhabited area and killed a colt tied up for the night in a shed on the fringes of Naiwala village under Heempur police station area.

On Sunday, its owner discovered the carcass and informed police. According to the Liyaqat Ali , “I have some horses, including a colt. They were tied in the yard on the outskirts of the village. I found its partially devoured carcass on Sunday. Earlier. I had spotted a leopard in the area.”

As news spread, angry villagers gathered at the spot. They staged a protest against forest department and alleged that they had informed the forest authorities about the presence of a leopard in the area but they did nothing to catch it.

After being informed about the colt’s killing, a forest team reached the spot. But enraged villagers took them hostage and held them captive for hours. They demanded that the leopard be caught and released into the forest area. In summer, most villagers sleep in the open and with a leopard prowling about, the situation can prove to be dangerous, especially as these leopards are known to lift children.

The forest authorities were set free only after they assured the villagers that they would set up a cage in the area to catch the leopard.

Confirming that the colt was killed by the leopard, Bijnor divisional forest officer M Semmaran said, “The colt’s post-mortem revealed that it was eaten by a leopard. There is a provision that if we set up a cage, we have to take permission from the higher authorities. The procedure is underway and cage will be set up soon. We have convinced villagers that it will not attack the human being. But they should take precautions. When a leopard does not get its natural prey, it moves towards populated area in search of small prey like dogs, goats, calves, colts, sheep and poultry.”

Police outside the house in which a murder accused was holding children hostage in Farrukhabad district on Thu... Read More

KATHARIYA VILLAGE( FARRUKHABAD): When 25 children in UP’s Farrukhabad district entered Subhash Batham ’s house on Thursday evening, apart from the missing confetti there was little indication that this wasn’t, in fact, a birthday party. They were welcomed by Batham’s wife into a 10 x 8 basement where several packets of snacks, biscuits, chocolates and milk were kept. The cold, mud floor was covered in mats for the kids to sit on. In the ensuing 10 hours in which the crisis unfolded, Batham and his wife reportedly took turns to check up on the kids, with the latter even serving them roti and sabzi.

For these children in Kathariya village, most of whom were aged between one and 15, a birthday invite was as rare as it was alluring. Many hail from poor households, with their parents struggling to make ends meet. So when word spread around on Thursday afternoon that a party was to be held, they were eager to join the celebrations. Their parents too felt there was little reason to worry.

Batham had a chequered past — he had spent 12 years in prison for killing his uncle — but he hadn’t displayed aggressive behaviour towards anyone in the village and as one villager said, ""It had been years since that incident in 2001."" But within hours, as news came that Batham was armed and making demands to release the children, parents started assembling in front of the house, fearing the worst. Inside, the children were anxious but well-fed.

A day later, many of the children TOI spoke to said they were still shocked with the turn of events but happy to be back home. The younger ones, however, showed little understanding that they had been at the centre of a raging drama that had everyone on tenterhooks. But most seemed to agree on one thing — their kidnapper was not out to harm them. ""I don’t believe he (Batham) wanted to harm us. He warned us to keep quiet and said there would be consequences if we didn’t, but he didn’t hurt anyone,"" said Anjali Kumari , the eldest among those who had been held hostage. Batham had a pistol and a rifle with him, said the children, but he never pointed it at them.

On Friday, when TOI visited the spot, candy wrappers were strewn across the basement. Instead of a staircase, a ladder paved the way to the dingy space bereft of windows, with an LED bulb the only source of light. A metal door separated the basement from the rest of the house. It was this door that Anjali bolted shut after the children had been stuck in the room for hours and their patience started wearing thin. This cut off Batham’s access to the children and minimised their chances of getting caught in a crossfire. ""After I locked the door, Subash uncle and his wife banged on the door several times, but I didn’t open it. Two hours later, we were rescued by police,” said Anjali.

While initially scared, the children said they felt better once food was served. Arun Kumar , 10, said that the couple served everyone food and water. “We were given biscuit, chocolate, milk, water and some ate roti and sabzi. But when we wanted to pee, we were told to go in a corner and relieve ourselves,” added Soni Kumari, 12, who was confined along with two of her siblings. As there wasn’t much to do, some of the children went to sleep.

When an infant wouldn’t stop crying, Batham decided to go outside to release her. That’s when Anjali shut the door from inside. The children didn’t have to wait long though. A couple of hours, later, police made their way to the building and shot Batham dead.

Residents of the quiet village said they were still coming to terms with the incident that had shoved them into the limelight. But things could have turned out differently, said Babli Devi, whose house is next to Batham’s. ""Three of my children were in there too. And I will always remember this traumatic night but would I have wanted them dead for it? I don’t think so. Perhaps, police could have caught Batham, instead of killing him.""

A police officer said, ""We negotiated with Batham for hours and went into the building to arrest him, but he brandished a gun. So we had to shoot.""

The couple have been booked under sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement). Batham has also been booked under the Arms Act.

According to locals, Subhash appeared to be heavily drunk. He was accused in four criminal cases other than a murder case in which he was convicted and given a life term. NSG commandos were kept on standby.Earlier in the day, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath convened a high-level meeting on the hostage incident. The meeting was attended by the chief secretary, principal secretary (home), DGP and the ADGP (law and order).

BHOPAL: An eerie silence grips you in the fifth-floor flat that was the scene of so much agony and turmoil only a week ago when a crazed stalker took a model hostage at gunpoint, stabbed her in the neck and let her bleed for 12 hours as he played games with police.

The survivor still carries stitches and bruises from her ordeal, but is determined not to give in. Giving details of the ‘longest day’ for the first time, she told TOI on Saturday that the hostage-taker, Rohit Singh, kept beating her brutally all through the 12-hour crisis and would hiss in her ears that she wouldn’t get out of the room alive. Showing a bite mark on her arm, she said: “After resisting a few times, I realized it was better to play submissive. I was bleeding from the neck wound and feared I would bleed to death.”

“But I am alive. I am strong and I will not let this kill my dreams. He only wanted cheap popularity. He was insisting that he would open the door only if a Bollywood celebrity comes,” she added.

Her parents, however, are still shaken. The room where the hostage crisis played out has not been cleaned. Every knock on the door sends shivers down their spines. The parents, who had never seen a police station or courtroom before this, are living in terror. “We saw such things only in movies. Now, I feel terrified simply walking through the parking lot. Every now and then, it feels as if Rohit is hiding behind a car and will pounce on me,” said her mother.

Rohit is now in jail custody and her parents have sought police protection, fearing that he will come after them once he is released. Recalling his arrest in February this year for threatening the family, the survivor’s mother said: “That time, someone calling herself his sister pleaded with us to spare him. Look, he came back with more dangerous intentions.”

They fear every stranger, say the parents. “Yesterday, I went to court to record my statement. When I was waiting outside the court, a man kept glaring at me. I felt terrified as I feared he is an accomplice of Rohit,” she said, adding that the incident has shattered the family. “I was trying to find a match for my son, who works in Mumbai but now have forgotten about that. My younger daughter was planning to take admission in MBA but she has almost cancelled the plan,” she said.

The survivor’s father said, “It has changed our lives. Many of our friends and relatives look at us differently now. We will have to try harder for the marriage of our children. My hands shake when I write something. What is the guarantee that Rohit will not come after us again? He should be jailed for life.”

What hurts the survivor more than the bruises on her body is the reaction of people around her. “People think that I became a victim because I was into modelling in Mumbai,” she said. Police, court and media are doing their job, but what about the security of my family, she asked. “Will anyone tell us how he entered my flat? How can we stop him from breaking in again?” she said.

GREATER NOIDA: A businessman and his family were held hostage at gunpoint for nearly two and half hours on Monday night in Dankaur and robbed of cash, jewellery and electronic items.

The victim has been identified as 45-year-old Satpal Singh, who lives with his wife and son. He owns a factory of electronic spare parts in the industrial area of Greater Noida .

Singh told police that around 8.30pm, two men in their late twenties came to his house and asked for water. When he returned with a bottle of water and tried to hand it over to them, the accused pushed him inside his house.

“The accused allegedly flashed a gun and pushed me inside the house. Four other men also barged in and locked the front door of the house. Later, one of them took me at gunpoint and asked my wife and son to be in one room while others searched the house till 11pm. They fled with at least Rs 50,000 cash, jewellery worth Rs 10 lakh and an LED TV,” Singh said in his complaint.

Singh was also beaten up by the robbers for trying to resist the robbery , said Jeetender, Singh’s relative. “When the two men flashed pistols at him, Satpal held their hands and pointed the gun towards the sky. This made them furious and they thrashed Satpal. Later they ate sweets and bananas that were kept in the fridge,” said Jeetender.

Rajpal Singh Tomar, SHO, Dankaur police station said, “The victim has reported that there was a lot of noise due to the wedding celebration when the assailants entered his house.

Highlights Cops paraded Rohit in public in Misrod on Saturday, and egged on people to whack him

Cops paraded Rohit in public in Misrod on Saturday, and egged on people to whack him

BHOPAL: Hostage taker Rohit Singh , who allegedly stabbed a model and held her confined in her bedroom for 12 hours in Bhopal on Friday, got a taste of public ‘justice’.

Cops paraded Rohit in public in Misrod on Saturday, and egged on people to whack him. Archana Sapre, a resident of the township where the rescued hostage lives, told TOI that police had informed them about the parade in advance. It was SP-south R K Lodha, who ordered that Rohit be paraded in public “to send a message”.

Residents, mostly women, lined up on the road with sticks, sandals and black paint. Rohit was brought in and the crowd was allowed to have a go at him.

The hostage taker, who claims to work as an assistant casting director in Bollywood, was unfazed. Showing just how dangerous he can be, he grabbed sub-inspector Rajni Chouhan’s hand — despite being hemmed in by cops — squeezed it hard and wouldn’t let go. It took two cops to prise his fingers off her.

Meanwhile, residents beat him with sandals, shoes and sticks. They were upset that they were not allowed to blacken his face. Sapre rues that the jostling of reporters and camerapersons did not give them enough room to assault him.

While this mob justice was playing out, the hostage lay in ICU, an oxygen mask covering her face. She is lucky to be alive because the scissors stab wound in her neck was 2 inches deep. The carotid artery is only about 2cm under the skin, which means the blades missed it by millimetres.

She bled for 12 hours from this wound and another stab to the thigh — again missing the femoral artery and major blood vessels — as police dragged on the negotiations.

She has been given three blood transfusions and still has an alarmingly low haemoglobin count of 6 gm/dl because of excessive blood loss, say sources in the medical staff treating her.

“Rohit had taken us hostage in our own home a few months ago. He was emboldened to repeat the offence because he wasn’t dealt with strictly then. We do not feel safe and don’t know if he will leave us alone now. He might attack us again. I feel he should rot in jail for life,” said the model’s mother.

ASP (Zone-II) Dinesh Kaushal, told TOI that she described him as a “psycho”. According to her, he broke into the house when her father had gone out for his morning walk, said Kaushal. “At gunpoint, he kept pressuring her to marry him and sign the stamp paper provided by police. When she resisted, he stabbed her with scissors. She decided to play submissive because she knew that he would shoot her if she fought him,” the ASP said.

PANAJI: The Congress on Saturday accused the management of a on-shore casino in North Goa of holding three employees hostage for five days following a discrepancy of Rs 1.8 crore in the casino’s accounts.

“The three employees were taken hostage, beaten up and deprived of food for five days,” Congress MLA Nilkanth Halarnkar told reporters on Saturday.

“We want an enquiry by the home ministry into this inhuman act,” Halarnkar said. “How can anyone lock employees in a room for five days, beat them up and deprive them of food, holding them hostage?” Halarnkar added that he decided to help one of the victims, Chandan Pant, a Nepali national whose case was brought to his notice by a city lawyer.

The three were kept hostage from December 16 to 20 in the casino, before they were rescued by the police.

Coerced by cops not to lodge complaint: Casino employee

Pant, who was also present for the press conference, explained how they were kept hostage for five days, even as he was on leave — he had gone home to Nepal — when the discrepancy in accounts happened. Pant also said his documents were not released by the casino management, making it difficult for him to find work elsewhere.

“Our question is why was no FIR filed against the casino that took these boys hostage?” Halarnkar asked. “This is despite the fact that a police team had to rescue the three persons from the custody of the casino.”

Pant, in his complaint to the DGP, said that after being rescued by the police team, he had been coerced by the police not to file a complaint against the casino management.

Prime Minister Imran Khan. (File photo)

PESHAWAR/ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's top leadership on Monday pledged to not allow militants with ""bigoted vision"" to take the country hostage as the nation mourned the 5th anniversary of massacre of 149 people, including 132 students, at the Army Public School in Peshawar .

In one of the most gruesome attacks on children anywhere in the world, 8-10 suicide attackers wearing paramilitary Frontier Corps uniforms on December 16, 2014 entered the Peshawar's Army Public School and went from classroom-to-classroom shooting indiscriminately, killing 149 people including 132 students.

Following the incident, Pakistan has hanged four men linked to the massacre, the BBC reported.

Prime Minister Imran Khan in his message affirmed that the militant mindset would not be allowed to take over the country.

""We pledge on this day that the militants will not be allowed to make the nation hostage to its bigoted vision,"" he said.

President Arif Alvi in his message said the nation would not forget the massacre of students and their teachers.

""Hard to commemorate this day without tears in one's eyes. In its remembrance, we reiterate our pledge to root out terrorism and extremism in all its manifestations from our country,"" Alvi said.

Pakistan army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa, in his message said that the carnage will never be forgotten.

Bajwa said that Pakistan had come a long way in defeating the scourge of militancy.

""We have come a long way in failing terrorism as a nation. United we move towards lasting peace and prosperity of Pakistan,"" he said.

Human rights minister Shireen Mazari said the incident had shook the nation.

The responsibility for the attack in 2014 was claimed by the outlawed Mullah Fazlullah-led Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.

""The attack on the Army Public School saw a shift in public opinion on the country's struggle against militancy. In the aftermath of the attack, the army intensified operation Zarb-e-Azb in tribal areas where militants had previously operated with impunity, and the government announced to launch the sweeping National Action Plan to tackle militancy,"" the Dawn reported.

NEW DELHI: IL&FS Transportation Network Limited ( ITNL ), a part of the beleaguered IL&FS Group, on Monday said four of its employees who were held hostage for three months by workers in Ethiopia have returned home.

The firm managed to “secure” their safe return after paying severance pay of four months to workers who were involved with road projects being executed by ITNL, through its subsidiary Elsamex SA. But at least one employee, Chandra Sekhar, is still in Ethiopia as the authorities have barred him from leaving the country till IL&FS clears statutory dues.

The employee is currently out on bail with no certainty on when the group will clear the dues, enabling his return to India. Since mid-2018, under instructions of ITNL, several Indian employees working in its project companies had returned to India. Seven employees were held hostage by unpaid local workers in November with three of them managing to return home between December 2018 and January 2019.

The Indian employees have also not received salaries for six to seven months and there is no clarity on when and how much IL&FS will actually pay them. “The company thanks all the agencies including the MEA... for their efforts towards facilitating the safe return of its employees,” IL&FS said on Monday.

GURUGRAM: Around 15 armed robbers held security guards hostage at gunpoint at a construction site in Sector 62 on Wednesday and fled with aluminium frames and other equipment worth Rs 15 lakh.

According to police, the crime took place between 2am and 4am on Wednesday. Six security guards were on duty at the project site of Imperia MindSpace in Sector 62 when around 15 men reached the spot on a canter truck. Project engineer Mohammad Navajid claimed that the robbers caught the guards by surprise and tied them up at gunpoint.

“Four or five of them stood watch after taking our guards hostage and grabbing their mobile phones. The others loaded aluminum frames and other construction materials onto the truck. They also stole computers from the office, and left around 4am. The guards managed to inform the supervisor after that, and we reached the spot some time later, after which police was informed around 9am,” Navajid told police in his complaint.

“There are many holes in the complaint. They haven’t provided any explanation on why police was not informed soon after the crime,” a senior police officer said.

An FIR was registered against the robbers, who haven’t been identified yet, under Sections 395 (robbery) and 397 ( robbery with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt) of the IPC and Sections 25-54-59 of the Arms Act at Sector 65 police station later the same day.

“There were no CCTV cameras at the site, but we are trying to identify the accused,” said inspector Shukrapal, SHO of Sector 65 police station.

GURUGRAM: A 27-year-old manager of a private company was held hostage , assaulted and robbed by four car-borne assailants on Delhi-Gurgaon expressway on Saturday evening.

According to the complaint filed by Umesh Kumar, an Airtel employee, the men held him hostage for over seven hours and robbed him of more than Rs 1 lakh. On Saturday, around 7.30pm, Umesh was waiting for a transport to go home. A car with four men stopped by and offered him a lift, police said. Assuming it to be a shared cab, the resident of Delhi’s Uttam Nagar boarded it. After a moment, two assailants snatched his mobile phone, wallet containing Rs 2,000 and the laptop bag.

“They also snatched my ATM card and two credit cards,” the complainant told police. Around 9pm, the car reached Sohna road and Umesh was forced to withdraw Rs 70,000 from an ATM. The accused also used his credit cards to purchase items worth Rs 26,000.

FAIZABAD: Violence erupted at Faizabad divisional jail, following clashes between two groups of inmates on Saturday. Crisis deepened when jail guards were held hostage by inmates, who laid siege to the prison compound and demanded action against those who triggered violence.Agitated jail inmates threatened to blow up LPG cylinders inside the mess, forcing police and PAC jawans to exercise caution while trying to restore order. Senior officials were forced to use drone cameras to take stock of the situation. The situation was brought under control after senior administrative officials reached the site to supervise police action and convinced inmates to call off their protest.Sparks flew when some inmates recently shifted from Azamgarh Prison were spotted using a mobile phone by prison guard, Bhola, who informed the jail superintendent. Enraged over this, the new inmates thrashed Bhola. When other prisoners rushed to his rescue, they too were attacked. The situation worsened when other inmates created ruckus, demanding action against those who attacked the guard and held them hostage.The jail administration’s attempt to bring additional reinforcements failed as inmates took over the jail mess and threatened to blow up the kitchen to keep security forces at bay. CCTV cameras were also damaged. Authorities used drone cameras to identify strategic entry points inside the campus and then used force to counter the rampaging prisoners.It took authorities almost 6 hours to gain access into the prison and rescue inmates held hostage and rush them to the district hospital for treatment as they were injured. Faizabad district magistrate Anil Kumar Pathak said, a magisterial inquiry has been ordered into the incident and action will be initiated against those responsible for violence, once the probe report is received."

The victim , who works as a senior systems manager with a software company, was returning home after attending official work and a family event in Bengaluru.

He was to leave for Chennai in a bus operated by SRS Travels around 11.50pm on January 31. ""My bus was scheduled to arrive at Bommasandra around 11.50pm but it didn't.

They pinned me down to the car's floor and then blindfolded me and made me immobile by wrapping a thick blanket around,"" the victim said.

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump thanked Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and his Afghan counterpart Ashraf Ghani for their support in the release of an American and an Australian hostages held by Taliban since 2016, the White House said.

On Tuesday, Australian Timothy Weeks, 50, and Kevin King, 63, an American, were handed over to US forces in Afghanistan's southern Zabul province . In return, the Afghan government freed three high-ranking Taliban prisoners.

The three members of the Taliban-linked Haqqani network who were released include Anas Haqqani, Haji Mali Khan and Hafiz Rashid.

The two separate calls were made by Trump on Thursday, the White House said.

In his phone call with Khan, Trump thanked for Pakistan's support for the recovery of the two hostages, the White House said in a readout of the call.

""Trump hopes this positive development will contribute to furthering the peace process in Afghanistan,"" it said.

""The two leaders also reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening the United States-Pakistan trade relationship, which is on track to set a new record this year, as well as investment and people-to-people ties between our countries,"" the readout said.

Meanwhile, according to a statement from the Pakistan's Prime Minister office, Khan also apprised President Trump of the current situation in Kashmir .

Appreciating President Trump's continued engagement as well as mediation offer, Prime Minister Khan stressed that the US president must continue his efforts for facilitation of a peaceful solution of the Kashmir issue, the statement said.

Trump has repeatedly offered to mediate between India and Pakistan to resolve the Kashmir issue.

New Delhi has been maintaining that Kashmir is a bilateral matter between India and Pakistan with no scope for third party mediation.

Recalling their conversations in Washington and New York, the two leaders agreed to deepen bilateral collaboration, including in relevant multilateral fora.

The two leaders further agreed to remain in close contact.

In his call with Afghan President Ghani, Trump expressed appreciation for his support in freeing the two hostages. Trump affirmed the important role of the Afghan government in its country's peace process, it said.

""Both sides agreed a reduction in violence is necessary to move the peace process forward and for any intra-Afghan negotiations regarding a political settlement to be successful,” the White House said. Trump and Ghani reaffirmed their mutual objective of defeating terrorist threats against the US and Afghanistan, it said.

The Taliban control nearly half of Afghanistan, and are more powerful now than they were at any time since the 2001 US-led invasion after the 9/11 terror attacks

The US has continued to push for a ceasefire in the war-torn country and the opening of negotiations between the Taliban and the Kabul government.

The US has been conducting peace talks with the Taliban and the two sides were hopeful of a deal that included America cutting down on troops in Afghanistan and guarantees by Taliban of not allowing the Afghan soil to be ever used again for terror activities.

Pune: Four armed intruders on Wednesday morning held Mumbai-based cotton trader Hanskumar Khimji (79), his sister-in-law Hema Chheda (63) and domestic helps hostage at gunpoint for over three hours in his bungalow in an isolated bylane off Apte Road in the Deccan Gymkhana area. They robbed cash and valuables worth Rs 5.70 lakh.

The intruders moved into the ground-plus-one bungalow around 9.30am. When Khimji told them that he did not have much cash and valuables in the bungalow, one of the intruders left with the trader’s driver to his Mumbai office in Chheda’s car to collect Rs 1 crore.

For over three hours, the remaining three criminals moved around in Khimji’s bungalow after tying up the caretaker and domestic help. They pushed Khimji and Chheda into one of the rooms on the upper floor of the bungalow.

At one point around 1.30pm, all three criminals had moved out of the upper room. Chheda displayed alacrity to immediately bolt the door from the inside and raise an alarm. Panicked at her cries, the criminals ran out of the bungalow towards hotel Ramee Grand and from there fled towards Jangli Maharaj road.

The fourth culprit, who had by then reached Kurla in Mumbai in the car with Khimji’s driver, received an alert from his aides. He got down from the car and fled.

Chheda later lodged a complaint with the Deccan Gymkhana police, who registered an offence under sections 392 (robbery), 384 (extortion), 386 (extortion by putting a person in fear of death or grievous hurt) and 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Indian Arms Act.

When TOI visited the bungalow, Chheda’s son, who did not reveal his first name, said, “The criminals ran away from the bungalow thanks to the presence of mind shown by my mother. They have robbed some valuables. No one was hurt.”

Khimji occasionally visits the bungalow, “Saroj Sadan”. “It is an old structure and the owner wanted to sell it off,” senior inspector Bhaskar Jadhav of the Deccan Gymkhana police said.

“Khimji, Chheda, driver Shivaji Medage (50), caretaker Anant Khale (45) and a domestic help were in the bungalow on Wednesday morning when the doorbell rang. When Khale opened the door, the four men barged inside, pushed him down and tied his hands. Brandishing a firearm and sharp weapons, they threatened Khimji and the others of dire consequences. They tied up Medage and the maid with tape and locked them with Khale in one of the rooms. They pushed Khimji and Chheda into another room and asked them to hand over their valuables,” Jadhav said.

When Khimji told them that he did not have much cash and valuables in the bungalow, one of the criminals left with the driver to the trader’s Mumbai office to collect Rs 1 crore. The criminals told Khimji and Chheda that three of them would remain in the bungalow till the driver returned with the money.

Two criminals searched Khimji’s cupboards and took gold and diamond ornaments worth Rs 5.70 lakh. Their third accomplice sat in the room where Khimji and Chheda were kept hostage. “They were constantly in touch with their fourth accomplice travelling to Mumbai. They moved around the bungalow smoking,” Jadhav said.

“While the criminals were inside, some interested buyers had come to Khimji’s bungalow. When they rang the bell, the trio did not respond initially. As the bell was constantly ringing, one of them went down and had a talk with one of them at the door,” Jadhav said.

When the criminal in Khimji’s room went out to talk with the others around 1.30pm, Chheda locked the door from inside, ran towards the window and started calling out to the neighbours in the adjacent bungalow and residents of a building nearby. The criminals panicked and fled with a bag containing the booty.

Jadhav said the car driver and the fourth criminal had reached Kurla by then. “The driver later told us that the criminal told him to stop the car around 1.30pm and fled,” he said.

PUNE: The Chandannagar police on Wednesday booked eight men for allegedly kidnapping a 25-year-old marketing businessman Mahendra Patil of Jalgaon on April 30 from a lodge in Kharadi and demanding a ransom for Rs 5 crore.

Patil, who escaped from the kidnappers’ clutches, lodged an FIR stating that the suspects had robbed his smartphone, gold chain, bracelet, wrist watch and stole his car collectively worth over Rs 3.67 lakh.

SHAHJAHANPUR: In another embarrassment to UP Police, two head constables were arrested on Tuesday for allegedly stopping a businessman on the road on the pretext of checking his car and holding him and his driver hostage in the vehicle for hours for ransom. The duo had received information that the businessman was carrying Rs 50 lakh in his car and were lying in wait for him on Tilhar road in Shahjahanpur. The businessman managed to contact his partner, who informed police and the hostages were rescued.

Both accused policemen were immediately suspended, arrested and booked for extortion and fraud. Both were sent to jail after they were presented before the chief judicial magistrate on Tuesday.

Prem Prakash, additional director general of police, Bareilly zone, told TOI, “They (head constables) have been booked under relevant IPC sections. SP, Shahjahanpur has orally informed me about the incident and I am waiting for a written report in this matter. Stern action will be taken.”

According to sources, Gyanendra Pandey, a businessman based in Uttarakhand’s Kashipur town was on way to Hardoi district in his car along with driver, Prashant Kumar, on Monday, when the two head constables flagged the vehicle to stop in Tilhar area of Shahjahanpur district . Pandey was carrying Rs 50 lakh with him for purchasing paddy from a local dealer in Hardoi.

What Pandey did not know was that the two policemen — head constable Mahendra Singh, who was posted at Tilhar police station, and Satyadev, a former member of the crime branch team who was recently transferred to reserve lines after a complaint -- had prior information that he was carrying Rs 50 lakh and were lying in wait for him.

Satyadev allegedly introduced himself as sub-inspector Abhishek Kumar from the income-tax department to Pandey, “inspected” his car and “seized” the cash. Thereafter, one of the policemen took charge of the car and told Pandey that the cash would be submitted at the income-tax office where he would have to reveal the source of the money. But instead of taking the businessman and driver to the I-T office, the duo drove towards Jalalabad. Later, they demanded more money.

Meanwhile, Pandey sensed that both men were trying to dupe him and so he requested them to allow him to make a phone call to his partner. Pandey somehow managed to convey his situation to his partner and asked him to contact police for help.

This matter was brought to the attention of inspector general of police, Bareilly range and all the police stations in Shahjahanpur were alerted. A massive manhunt was launched. In the night, SHO of Jalalabad police station, Harendra Singh, located the businessman’s car and rescued the two men held hostage.

On Pandey’s complaint, an FIR was registered against both policemen under IPC section 386 (extortion with deadly weapon) and 420 (forgery).

Additional SP (rural) SC Shakya told TOI , “This is the result of extreme greediness displayed by both policemen. Both were arrested on Monday night. The businessman was rescued. We have handed over the cash to the Income Tax department and both policemen have been sent to jail.”

Last month, 13 Bulandshahr policemen, including five SIs, were arrested for looting a local resident of his two motorcycles and Rs 84,000. All the policemen were posted in Khurja police station.

In May, a WhatsApp message had claimed to have exposed a rate card of bribes demanded by UP cops for different offences. As many as 18 officers of the Special Operation Group of the Noida Police were transferred to police line after a probe.

BENGALURU: The case of JD(S) legislator K Narayana Gowda allegedly being “held hostage” in Mumbai and being prevented from meeting anyone, including his family members, figured in the legislative assembly on Tuesday.

Raising the issue during the debate on the audio clip, JD(S) legislator KM Shivalingegowda said after learning that Gowda was ill, his family members had gone to Mumbai to meet him. But, he claimed, the people holding the MLA captive did not allow them to meet him

“This is where we have reached,” Shivalingegowda said. “MLAs are being held captive and purchased in an attempt to grab power.”

Without naming the BJP , he took the saffron party to task for trying to bribe ruling coalition MLAs to get them to resign in a bid to topple the government. “There is an urgent need for a law that prevents MLAs from resigning their assembly membership before the end of their tenure. Only this can stop MLAs being lured through inducements,” Shivalingegowda said.

CN Balakrishna, also of the JD(S), expressed concern over Gowda’s safety. “He represents a constituency that borders mine and I know him very well. He has been held hostage in Maharashtra,” Balakrishna claimed.

BJP members took serious exception to JD(S) legislators raising the issue instead of taking action against those who have kept their MLA captive. “You are part of the government and you are free to conduct an inquiry if your MLA is really being held hostage by anyone,” BJP MLA Basavaraj Bommai said. “It is not right on your part to play the victim card.”

A former JD(S) MLA had sneaked into the hotel in Mumbai where Gowda is staying and spoke to him. “Using the visitor’s phone, Gowda called up chief minister HD Kumaraswamy on Monday and narrated his plight,’’ sources added.

On February 8, Gowda, who represents Krishnarajpet in Mandya district, released a video and photos of him in a Mumbai hospital and said he’s with JD(S) and would return once he recovers. “The photos were stage-managed by the BJP,’’ JD(S) sources said.

BJP denies: The BJP denied it has kept Gowda a hostage. BJP state general secretary and MLA CT Ravi said JD(S) was trying to malign his party. “Gowda is in touch with JD(S),” he said.

Sumaiya Khatun inside the van on Tuesday morning

BARASAT: A four-year-old girl, along with her 27-year-old mother, was forced to walk back her Barasat home after bandh supporters attacked the school van that the mother-daughter duo had boarded to reach school. They thought it won’t be right to travel by train either and decided to return home on foot.

Four-year-old Sumaiya Khatun and her mother Amina Begum spent more than 20 minutes fearing for their lives while remaining cooped up in a corner of the school van while bandh supporters damaged its looking glass, severely beat up the driver and tried to deflate its tyres at Barasat’s Champadali crossing around 7am. Sumaiya, a kindergarten student at Delhi Public Secondary School, and her mother, a non-teaching staffer of the same institution, board the van from this location every day to reach the campus at Barasat’s Moina. But Tuesday’s violence in front of their eyes forced a traumatised Sumaiya to return home with her mother on foot.

Witnesses said van driver Nayeem Ali (34), who took up this job two years ago, pleaded with the bandh supporters to let him go. But, Ali was dragged out and beaten up by bandh enforcers who relented only after the driver promised he would abandon his trip and not pick up any more students. After Sumaiya and her mother got off, Ali drove the empty bus to school before returning to his home at Barasat’s Sunripukur locality. At home, his six-year-old son Syed Ali and 11-year-old daughter Sumaiya Parveen were fearing the worst after seeing television footage of their father being beaten up. The duo later also abandoned their plans of going to their respective schools.

The West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights (WBCPCR) has taken cognizance of the matter. A show-cause notice is being sent to Sujan Chakrabarty and other office bearers of CPM, a source said.

Jayanta Mondal, the chief security guard of the school, however, said, “I attended my duty at the school and heard about the attack on our van.” Abhijit Banerjee , ASP, North 24 Parganas, said, “A case has been registered and we have already arrested 10 bandh supporters involved in the attack.”

KOZHIKODE: Maoists have denied that they have taken hostage migrants workers at the construction site of a resort in Meppadi in Wayanad and claimed that they only warned against the construction of the resort inside the forest.

Sources in the CPI (Maoist) said they had warned against the construction of the resort earlier too. They said the work on Emerald resort was stopped and all workers had returned after they issued the warning. The Maoists allege that it could be the police who sent the migrant labourers or they could be police agents.

Three migrant workers were stopped and questioned by an armed Maoist group at around 6pm on Thursday. Police said the workers came across four Maoists who were carrying arms. The workers tried to take photographs of the Maoists using a mobile phone.

One worker fled the scene and informed the police. Others were let off by the Maoists one by one.

After they returned, police took them to the camp to get the details of the Maoists. A police team and the members of the Thunderbolts have begun search operation for the Maoists in the forest.

Police believe the Maoists who stopped the workers were Vikram Gowda, Soman, Santhosh and Unnimaya. They said the Maoists have intensified their activities in Wayanad and Kozhikode districts in the recent months.

They suspect that B G Krishnamoothy, the Maoist leader from Karnataka , has been leading the rebels after the killing of Kuppu Devaraj in a police firing in Nilambur in 2015.

The Maoists had attacked a resort in Thirunelli in 2014 to mark the 10th anniversary of the formation of the PLGA. They had also threatened to take strong action against the resort mafia.

MOTIHARI: The faculty members of Mahatma Gandhi Central University ( MGCU ) in Motihari , who are on relay hunger strike since May 29, held the VC Arvind Kumar Agrawal hostage in his official chamber for almost eight hours on Thursday night. Students too joined the teachers in their protest after the VC rejected their demands to meet them and resolve their issues.

The teachers slept outside the VC’s chamber from 5pm to 1 am and the VC was allowed to go home only after he agreed to lodge FIRs on the issue of two audio clips which had gone viral on the social media.

The faculty members were protesting against the financial embezzlement made by the VC and forceful resignation of faculty members. They also alleged that the VC is harassing and threatening to implicate them under false charges. The teachers were joined by students in their protest after the ragging committee of the varsity decided to expel four students. The students termed the charges as fabricated and demanded the VC to redress their grievances which were quickly turned down.

“I was locked up in my chamber for eight hours by some teachers and I had to go without food and medicine. I had to call the SDO and DSP for my rescue. Though they reached the campus around 8pm, I was finally rescued at around 1am,” said the MGCU VC.

MGCU registrar Ashutosh Pradhan also lodged an FIR against six teachers for assaulting him.

The varsity campus has turned into a police camp since Tuesday after it opened after a monthlong summer vacation.

Iranian national Parvin Ghelichi arrived in Pune from Tehran in May. Her boyfriend Dhanraj Morarji (circled) told the police she was his wife, even as a visibly battered Ghelichi looked on

The Pune Police free student who was confined, beaten up by her boyfriend, the son of lateDhanraj Morarji, the son of textile tycoon Arvind Morarji and half-brother of actorturned politician Naghma, was arrested early Monday for assaulting his live-in partner, who is an Iranian national.The complainant, Parvin Ghelichi, told the police that Morarji kept her confined in his apartment in Koregaon Park, Pune, for over a month, and would beat her up on the flimsiest of pretexts. The Pune Police rescued 30-year-old Ghelichi from the flat in an operation lasting many hours of the night intervening between Sunday and Monday.Morarji has been booked under the Indian Penal Code sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 342 (wrongful confinement), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means), 370 (buying or disposing of any person as a slave), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 506 (criminal intimidation).The police have managed to retrieve Ghelichi’s passport, mobile phone, and other documents. Throughout the police operation, Morarji kept insisting that Naghma was his sister.Ghelichi told the police that she had come to Pune to pursue a course in computer software. She managed to alert a friend about her ordeal with a desperate message on Instagram. Her friend in turn got in touch with Mirror, whose reporter witnessed her rescue by the Koregaon Park police at the upscaleAs she ran out of the house and into the arms of her friend, amid Morarji’s violent protestations, the bruised and battered student broke down, narrating the story of the entire nightmare.Ghelichi, who is from Tehran, arrived in Pune in May this year to pursue a two-year diploma in computer tech. During recording a statement with the police, she said that she met Morarji through a common friend in the first week of November. After a few meetings, a romance began budding, and soon, Ghelichi moved into Morarji’s apartment.“He was really nice to me initially. He kept on showering me with affection and I really loved him for making me feel special,” Ghelichi told the police. Rapidly thereafter, things went downhill between the couple.She said that Morarji began to beat her up often over the pettiest issues. “He once fought with a friend and got very riled up. Before I knew what he was doing, he started punching and kicking me. I just couldn’t wrap my head around what was happening.”“He would assault me for no rhyme or reason at least a couple of times a week. Each time he beat me up, the next morning, he would wake up and express regret for his actions. Even though I wanted to escape, I couldn’t — all my documents and passport were locked away with him. Every night, he kept dogs he had made ferocious right outside the bedroom, to ensure I did not step out without him,” Ghelichi revealed. There were just a few moments that Morarji gave Ghelichi her phone back in the last few weeks, but he always went through all her texts. “Even when I would message my mother, I had to show him the phone first” she claimed. This torment lasted for well over a month. Finally, by December 22, Ghelichi couldn’t take it anymore. “He took me out for dinner with one of his cronies against my will. Iwent to use the washroom. As soon as I came out, he slapped me hard and I started bleeding. Once we got home, he thrashed me all over again,” she wept. Luckily for her, Morarji stepped out of the house that very night — seizing the opportunity, she gathered enough courage to grab her phone and send out a desperate message for help to a friend, who is also from Tehran. “I used Instagram to send this message — Iknew he would go through my phone and multiple apps once more. But he was not very good with Instagram,” she told cops. Her friend got in touch with the Mirror team. Within hours, a rescue was planned by a team of Koregaon Park cops, who reached the society around 12.15 am. Morarji’s flat is on the third floor, and his entrance covered by closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras. When he opened the door, police told him that they had received a complaint about a woman being kept forcefully in the house. While he was not even ready to let the police see Ghelichi, after an argument of 15 minutes or so, two female constables managed to get her out. Throughout, Morarji continued shouting at the cops, claiming Ghelichi is his wife.After an hour or so of arguments, cops finally took the woman away to the police station. Police inspector (crime) Ganesh Mane of Koregaon Park Police Station said, “Morarji was arrested and produced in court, which remanded him in police custody for two days. Investigations are on.”"

GURUGRAM: A senior executive, working as manager with a travel company, was robbed on Monday evening by four men who offered him a lift in their car from Atlas Chowk.

Rahul Gupta (33), resident of Azadpur in New Delhi, told police he was offered a lift by the gang around 9.15pm on Monday, after he reached Atlas Chowk from his office on Sohna road, while he was looking for transportation to reach his home. A white Swift Dzire with commercial number which had three passengers, stopped near him. When he asked the driver if he could get a drop till Azadpur, the driver asked him to get inside.

“But, instead of going towards Delhi, the driver took a U-turn from Shankar Chowk. When I asked why he had taken the U-turn, he said it was a mistake and he’d take another U-turn from the next cut. But after reaching IFFCO Chowk, he turned towards Sector 17-18, instead of going towards Delhi,” said Gupta. When he confronted the driver, two of the “passengers” sitting beside him in the rear seat pulled out a gun and held it to his head.

The accused then slapped Gupta, saying “Bahot bol raha hai (You speak too much” and asked him to hand over his bank cards and cell phone. “I pleaded them not to harm me, and handed over my cards and cell phone. They forced me to share the card passwords and enquired about their withdrawal limits,” said Gupta, adding the accused took him to ATMs at different places and withdrew a total of Rs 65,000 from three ATMs, using three different cards.

The gang keep on moving all over the city in search of unmanned ATMs. One of them would cover his face before entering the ATM kiosks, while the other three held Gupta at gunpoint. This went on for two hours, after which they pushed him out of the car near Iffco Chowk at around 11.30pm. They returned his phone but took out its SIM card.

With the help of a passerby, Gupta contacted police. A PCR van took him to Sector 18 police station, from where he informed his wife about his experience and filed a complaint. Following this, an FIR was registered under sections 379B (snatching and use of force), 342 (wrongful confinement) and 34 (common intention) of the IPC against unknown accused.

Chandrapur: Naxalites set 16 vehicles on fire engaged in road construction work in Etapalli tehsil of Gadchiroli district on Friday night. The workers deployed for the work too were held hostage for the entire night, sources said. The incident came to light on Saturday morning.

Maoists in Dandakaranya area observe People Liberation Guerrilla Army ( PLGA) week every year between December 2 and 8 and execute many violent attacks during the period.

This year, the rebels took the security forces gearing up to counter PLGA week by surprise by carrying out massive arson a day before.

Sources said the road construction work was underway on Wattepalli Gattepali road at a site close to Halewra village in Etapalli tehsil. A large group of Naxalites came to the site during late night hours and rounded up all the labourers camping there.

They then took out diesel from the vehicles and set 10 JCB machines, 5 tractors and a pick-up van at the site on fire. Sources said that Naxalites stayed on the spot as the vehicles burned to ashes. The workers remained hostage at gunpoint till Maoists left.

Security forces rushed to the spot after the incident was reported in the morning. Combing operations have been launched in the area in search of the Naxalites.

In December 2016, Maoists had set on fire around 80 vehicles near Surjagarh hillock in one of the largest arsons in the history of the Maoists affected district.

Speculations are rife that the tactics could be the outcome of change in leadership after Nambala Keshav Rao alias Basavraju took over the reins of the banned CPI (Maoist) in the country.

Basavraj is learnt to be an aggressive leader and has been responsible for major attacks on security forces in rebel-dominated areas.

Maoists in Gadchiroli were on the backfoot after security forces killed around 40 Naxalites in Gadchiroli in April this year. Friday’s arson could be an attempt to bounce back under the new leadership, sources said.

Highlights Seven employees of IL&FS Transportation Network Ltd have been held hostage by unpaid workers in Ethiopia

These are a part of a group of 15 employees of a joint venture between IL&FS Transportation Networks and Spanish company Elsamex that is engaged in road construction

Representative Reuters photo

""Here (the) situation is very tense. May not be able to contact after one or two days... Local security hired by company are armed. They are with locals only."" It's an anguished cry for help from Neeraj Raghuvanshi, one of the seven employees of IL&FS Transportation Network Ltd held hostage by unpaid workers in Ethiopia .

Raghuvanshi, who TOI managed to contact, has been surviving on a diet of rice and potato for the last six days, with little help from his company. His colleagues, C Chandra Sekhar and KP Singh, who have managed to stay free in Addis Ababa, said the situation was very grim and they feared water supply would be snapped in the next few days. The seven employees are under ""house arrest"" and are not being allowed to venture out of their rooms, said one of their colleagues.

Raghuvanshi, Sekhar and Singh are part of a group of 15 employees of a joint venture between IL&FS Transportation Networks and Spanish company Elsamex that is engaged in road construction.

They are now facing the consequences of the mismanagement of former IL&FS chief Ravi Parthsarathy and his ousted team of executives. The Indian expats themselves have not been paid salaries for months, with some of the dues dating back to April.

With funds drying up, the Ethiopian Roads Authority has terminated the contracts and there is a fear that the joint venture may leave behind unpaid dues.

IL&FS Transportation Network was unable to pay salary to its 500-600 local staff in October and the dues for November, too, have piled up. The demand is for an immediate payment of around $300,000. ""But the problem will not stop there. Under local laws, the company has to offer severance packages for six months and there are unpaid dues of vendors,"" Chandra Sekhar, the country coordinator for ITNL Elsamex JV told TOI.

What has compounded the problem is that even Ethiopian authorities are worried that the company may not clear its dues, creating distress in the African country as the local employees are very poor and depend solely on their salaries for survival.

While the problem has been building up, the IL&FS management has refused to provide any help, alleged some of the employees taken hostage. IL&FS refused to comment on the hostage crisis, with a company executive saying that the issue was being handled by the external affairs ministry.

Can’t send funds

Asking for help

NEW DELHI: The external affairs ministry is investigating claims by expatriates in Ethiopia who say they are being held hostage by local staff that haven’t been paid after the financier Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd began defaulting on $12.6 billion in debt.Seven Indian workers from the shadow lender, which rocked financial markets after it began missing debt payments earlier this year, have been detained since November 25 at three sites in Ethiopia’s Oromia and Amhara states by unpaid local staff, according to an emailed letter from the employees.They said the possible termination of some road projects being built by Indian and Spanish joint ventures may have triggered local employees to panic. The workers said police and officials are taking the side of locals against the expatriate staff and that they were caught in the “middle of corporate disagreements, blame games and bureaucratic issues.”Oromia’s police commissioner general, Alemayehu Ejigu, the state’s deputy spokesman Deressa Terefe, and Amhara state’s spokesman Nigusu Tillahun didn’t immediately respond to two calls and two text messages.An official at the Indian embassy in the capital Addis Ababa said it was “closely following up with local Ethiopian authorities and IL&FS management to resolve the issue,” while a separate official in the foreign ministry in New Delhi confirmed they were looking into the matter. A spokesman for IL&FS declined to comment.“Concerns of project termination and absence of senior management from project camps might have triggered panic in local employees and led them to believe confining expat employees might force the organization to pay their salaries,” the employees wrote in a letter addressed to the Indian and Spanish ambassadors, as well as a number of Ethiopian ministries and the local World Bank representative.The son of detained IL&FS employee Sukhvinder Singh Khokher said his father has been in touch with the Indian embassy and there are efforts underway to try and get the local Ethiopian staff paid.""The local Ethiopian workers shut the gates and the local policeman support them,"" Satinder Pal Singh Khokher, who works for the Aditya Birla Group in Gujarat according to LinkedIn, said in an interview. “I have tweeted my concern to the Prime Minister of India.""According to the employees’ letter, management cited restrictions imposed by the Reserve Bank of India for its inability to send funds. IL&FS had defaulted on paying both taxes and local employee pensions for nine months, the letter said. Ethiopian Revenue Ministry spokesman Addis Yirga and Attorney General Office spokesman Zinabu Tunu said by phone they couldn’t comment on the employees’ concerns expressed in the letter.“We tried to reason with local employees and tried to assure that salaries will be paid in due course and restricting expat colleagues will not result in what they are trying to achieve.” the employees said in the letter.The detention of IL&FS employees in Ethiopia, who were reported to be working on road construction projects for joint ventures between IL&FS Transportation Networks Ltd and Spanish firms Elsamex SA and Ecoasfalt SA, illustrates the sprawling nature and global reach of the beleaguered infrastructure lender. The firm hasn’t stopped missing debt payments even after the Indian government fired the lender’s board and tapped well-known Indian banker Uday Kotak to help lead the firm’s recovery as the company reeled under $12.6 billion of debt.Representatives of Elsamex SA and Ecoasfalt SA in Spain were not immediately able to comment when contacted on their office numbers on Thursday.Several men identifying themselves as IL&FS employees in Ethiopia, who didn’t respond to requests for comment, have been tweeting Indian politicians asking for help.“We 7 employee from #ILFS are hostages by local labor/staff at in Ethiopia from last 4 days coz of nonpayment of creditors and local salaries,” Neeraj Raghuwanshi said in a tweet on November 27, in which he tagged Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “#ILFS denied to send fund from India. Kindly save us. Day2day situation worsening.”Raghuwanshi posted a screen grab of an email he wrote pleading for help, mentioning IL&FS’s local partner, the Ethiopian Roads Authority. He said the Authority would not take any action to help the detained employees before local staff were paid.Ethiopian Roads Authority director general Habtamu Tegegne didn’t immediately respond to two calls to his office phone. The Spanish ambassador to Ethiopia, Borja Montesino Martínez del Cerro, didn’t immediately respond to two emails seeking comment."

He had earlier put the number of children taken at 79, but later said one of their number was in fact a teacher, who remained with the kidnappers.

Fonki and the Cameroonian military have accused anglophone separatists of carrying out the kidnappings, but a separatist spokesman denied involvement.

In an inauguration speech following last month's election to extend his 36-year rule, President Paul Biya told the separatists to lay down their arms or face the full force of the law, offering no concessions to them.

Anglophone secessionists have imposed curfews and closed schools as part of their protest against Biya's French-speaking government and its perceived marginalisation of the English-speaking minority, although they had never kidnapped children before.

An FIR for robbery has been registered against criminals.

NOIDA: A doctor couple and three other family members were taken hostage in their own car by an armed gang on National Highway-91 and robbed off cash and valuables while the family was returning from Aligarh to Ghaziabad late on Tuesday night.

According to Garg, some five or six armed criminals started tailing them in a Maruti Swift car on the way. “When we reached near Luharni Toll, the criminals overtook our car and forced us to stop. They got down from their vehicle and asked us to open the door. When we did not open the door, the criminals smashed the windshield and forced us to open the door at gun point,” he said.

The criminals threatened the family of dire consequences if they resisted the robbery bid. Vishal Garg said they robbed two diamond necklaces, five gold rings, two gold bangles, and Rs 35,000. “Two criminals got inside our car. One of them took the driving seat and tried to drive. The car was automatic and had no keys. The criminals tried but could not operate it,” he said.

After some time the criminals fled with the valuables and cash worth Rs 7 lakh in their Maruti Swift car. The victims then drove their car to Dadri police station and registered an FIR.

MUMBAI: After a month-long stir on the campus, the TISS administration filed an “incident report” to inform police about the disruption and to prevent loss of documents and damage to property.

Students on the campus claimed the institute falsely accused them of vandalizing the registrar’s office, including breaking of CCTV facilities and other fixtures. A representation from the students said police entered the campus around 11.30am on Monday for a routine investigation.

“We assured police that we did not indulge in any vandalizing acts and the allegation against us was baseless as the protest has remained non-violent since the beginning,” said a student.

“This is perceived as an act of extreme moral deficit of the TISS administration. Instead of addressing our demands they have resorted to false narratives and intimidation tactics through the interference of police,” said the protesting students in a statement. They added that the students have gained higher resolve to continue the peaceful blockage of the administration block until the authorities agree to a ‘sincere’ meeting with the student body.

TISS authorities claimed the students encroached upon the registrar’s office on March 23 and held a senior professor hostage till the wee hours of March 24.

“The administrative wing of the institute is inaccessible to staff members. Keeping in mind the continuous disruptive tactics used by students, the institute filed the incident report. This is a preventive action initiated by the administration for the authorities to take note of the incidents and registered after nearly a month-long stir by a section of students. In view of the incident report, only one police officer visited the institute to take stock of the situation,” said the institute’s official statement. “It was an effort to prevent loss to property in the administrative office. We appeal to students not to disrupt normal functioning of the institute and desist from acts of vandalism,” it added. tnn

Highlights Not all attempts to rescue Indian hostages abroad have ended on a sad note

There have been instances in the past when India has managed to bring back hostages safely back home

NEW DELHI: Not all attempts to rescue Indian hostages abroad have ended on a sad note, unlike what happened with the 39 Indian labourers.

Two high-profile cases, both in Iraq, were the release and repatriation of Indian truckers in 2004 and that of 46 Kerala nurses around the same time the 39 Indian workers were abducted.

The nurses were kidnapped from a hospital in the Iraqi city of Tikrit. While foreign minister Sushma Swaraj contacted foreign ministers of almost every Gulf country to secure their release, a few Kerala businessmen are also said to have played a key role in convincing IS to free them.

Similarly, three Indian truckers were abducted by anti-US fighters while on their way to Iraq from Kuwait in 2004. The then Manmohan Singh government managed to get them released after protracted negotiations headed by then junior foreign minister E Ahameds. It helped that the kidnappers were not anti-India.

In another high-profile case, Father Tom Uzhunnalil of Kerala was released from Yemen with help from Oman in September 2017. Oman helped India secure his release after a request from the Vatican.

In July 2016, Judith D’Souza, an Indian NGO worker who was abducted from Kabul in Afghanistan , was rescued.

Ludhiana: High drama was witnessed during a demolition drive in various areas under Zone C, when a building inspector of MC was held hostage by encroachers on Wednesday evening. The MC team from Zone C had gone for demolition of illegal shops, and one of the shop owners interrupted the drive and held the building inspector hostage .

The MC staff demolished around 32 under-construction and already constructed shops in different areas like Daba Road, Giaspura, and Lohara. The officials were dismantling shops in Krishna Colony, when one of the owners, Rajnish Tiwari, held the building inspector hostage and started indulging in an argument with him over the demolition of his shops. All arguments by the building inspector to make him understand that the commercial activity could not be carried out in the area — and the norms were not being fulfilled, due to which the commercial building plan could not be approved — failed to pacify him. The inspector was made to sit there on the site, and was not allowed to move along with machinery and other staff. The owners and other locals indulged in an argument with him, while asking the inspector to compensate for their loss.

The assistant town planner of Zone C, Kuldip Mangat, said there was no building plan approval to these shops, and when they demolished the shops, some locals created a ruckus. He said the owner of these shops was not aware of the building bylaws, and moreover, he was objecting to the action by MC, saying the department had damaged their properties and caused a loss, for which they should be compensated. He said it was only when he reached the site and convinced the people, that the building inspector was released.

NEW DELHI: Forget Turkey and Argentina. The Indian rupee ’s real bugbear is the price of oil. India’s currency had its worst month in three years in August as crude rallied on speculation sanctions on Iran will shrink global supplies.

Brent, the benchmark of half the world’s oil including India’s, has jumped by more than 70 per cent from a low set in the middle of last year. The commodity is currently trading at $77.10 per barrel, a whisker below a three-year high of $80.50 reached in May.

Burgeoning oil prices have pushed up India’s monthly oil imports to more than $10 billion in each of the three months through July. They were as little as $5.8 billion in both June and July last year.

Elevated oil prices are exerting pressure on both the current account and the fiscal deficit, and that’s weighing on the currency, according to Commerzbank AG.

“Last week, there were reports of strong month-end dollar demand, which may have accentuated the rupee’s decline,” analyst Charlie Lay wrote in a research note published Monday. Commerzbank is in the process of revising its rupee forecast and will probably lower it, he said.

Rising oil prices will probably see India’s current-account deficit widen to 2.6 per cent of gross domestic product in the financial year through March 2019, from 1.5 per cent a year earlier, according to Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.

“With the rupee having reached our year-end forecast of 71.5, the question is how much lower it can go,” head of research Khoon Goh and strategist Rini Sen wrote in a note on Wednesday. “The currency is still on the expensive side” and current fair value is around 73 per dollar, which suggests it will weaken further, they said.

They threatened to slit his throat if Beenu did not hand over valuables kept inside the house. They took her inside one of the rooms and forced her to hand over all the jewelry she was wearing. The men also forced her to open an almirah and searched inside for valuables,” said Teotia. Beenu shouted for help after the men left following which Teotia’s older daughter-in-law rushed downstairs.

On the basis of a complaint lodged by Teotia’s family, Ghaziabad police registered an FIR under IPC section 392 (loot) in Kavi Nagar police station against unidentified persons.

“We are scanning CCTV footage of the area. From the description given to us about the robbers, it seems they are local youth,” said Kavi Nagar circle officer Atish Kumar Singh.

BHAGALPUR: Angry over non-functioning air conditioner (AC), passengers of the Delhi-bound 12367 UP Vikramshila Express, forcibly stopped the train for nearly half an hour at the Bhagalpur railway station by pulling the chain several times, on Sunday.

Irate passengers also held the station superintendent (SS), Onkar Prasad, hostage on running train after he came to inquire about the delay in train’s departure at the platform. The GRP and the RPF finally rescued the SS at Sultanganj, nearly 30 km from Bhagalpur.

Meanwhile, amidst ruckus the train moved ahead on its journey to Delhi (Anand Vihar terminal). Panic gripped railway authorities following the incident and soon the GRP and RPF were informed by local railway personnel besides higher authorities. Soon senior railway officers sent a technician on-board and got the AC repaired by the time the train reached Sultanganj.

Prasad said, “We are inquiring the coach maintenance department and the people responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of coaches.”

When asked whether the railways would be initiating legal action against the passengers, the SS said senior railway officials are aware of the situation and legal action would be taken as per the directives. Meanwhile, the railway passengers’ association has demanded an open public inquiry so that innocent passengers are not harassed. “The railways should be held responsible for poor maintenance of the coaches. One can only imagine how passengers would have suffered in the closed AC coach without an air conditioner.

Avadesh Yadav held six people, including kumar and his daughter, hostage at gunpoint in Etah's Yadavnagar area... Read More

AGRA: Suresh Kumar , 56, owner of the house in Etah ’s Yadavnagar area where a former havaldar with the 1871 Rocket regiment of the artillery, Avadesh Yadav , held six people, including Kumar and his daughter, hostage at gunpoint, can’t get over those 20 nerve-shattering hours. One of the first things Kumar did after their ordeal came to an end was to lodge an FIR against his tenant, who was on Wednesday booked under IPC sections 307 (attempt to murder), 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement).

“I’ll never forget those 20 hours. It was terrifying and chaotic. On Monday afternoon, Yadav forced us upstairs at gunpoint and locked us up. He said that the enemy had surrounded us and it was time to retaliate. We tried to calm him down, but he did not listen to us,"" Kumar said, recalling events of the day before.

After his retirement in January 2014, Yadav’s family had been living in Kumar's two-storey house as tenants. Though he worked in Delhi, he often visited his wife and children there. ""The whole family was always very polite and humble. I don’t know how such a peaceful man suddenly turned into a maniac,” Kumar told TOI on Wednesday.

Kumar owns two houses — one in Jodhpura village where he lives with his wife and another in Yadavnagar where his two children, 20-year-old Poonam and 8-year-old Sachin, share the premises with Yadav's family. “It is a two-storey building. The ground floor is occupied by my children, the first floor by the Yadav family and the second one by another family, which was not present in the house on Monday. I have already sent my children to my other house and have asked the Yadav family to look for another place on rent,” Kumar said.

On Monday, Kumar had come to his Yadavnagar house to check on his children. “Thankfully, Sachin was still in school. I and my daughter were about to have lunch when I heard gunshots. When I looked up, I saw Yadav holding his .315 bore rifle which was aimed at me. He locked every door in the house. He made his father, wife, two children, me and my daughter sit on the staircase and didn’t let us move. He ordered us to stay quiet.”

The hostage situation had ended after a SWAT team aided by 60 policemen from Etah eventually managed to enter the house and restrain Yadav, who has now been sent to jail."

CHENNAI: Two men from the city died and four were injured in road accidents involving government buses on Sunday when the strike called by transport workers’ unions entered a fourth day.

State transport minister M R Vijayabhaskar urged employees to return to work even as the government and trade unions that called the strike prepared for a key hearing in the Madras high court on Monday.

While one casualty was reported near Santhome Church in Chennai, the other accident took place in Vriddhachalam, Cuddalore district, where the victim’s family was on a holiday. Police said David Seyon Kumar, 37, a resident of Kilpauk, had travelled to Cuddalore with his family to attend a function. He was travelling with his brotherin-law Samuvel, 35, and his seven-year-old daughter Sharon on a two-wheeler and when their vehicle reached the Vriddhachalam bus stand a government town bus hit him from behind.

“Losing control of the bus, the driver ran over David’ s motorcycle and hit another government bus in front,” a police officer said. “If not for the other bus, the driver would have killed 10 others at an eatery near the bus stand.”

The driver, J Ezhumalai, 35, from Erumanur of the same district usually drives tractors on agricultural fields and was unable to control the ill-maintained bus at the sharp curve ahead of the entrance of the bus stand,” said a transport department official. Ezhumalai has been remanded and an FIR lodged, said police.

Police said all three accident victims were rushed to the local government hospital where David was declared brought dead. Others were referred to Villupuram Government Hospital and later to Royapettah Government Hospital in Chennai. Samuvel sustained a head injury but was recovering, said hospital sources.

Soon after the accident, commuters and other union members protested against deployment of inexperienced drivers to operate government buses. Regional transport officer Santhoshini Chandra arrived at the spot as protestors had started to block buses operated by temporary staff. A dozen protestors were detained.

In the accident near Santhome, an MTC bus knocked down an 18-year-old biker around 3 pm. The victim, identified as Ajith Kumar R from Dummil Kuppam, was crossing the road when the accident happened, said a traffic investigation officer.

Police said the bus was plying between Broadway bus terminus and Kannagi Nagar and its driver sped away with the vehicle after hitting the biker. Police said there were no witnesses but have procured security camera footage from nearby to identify the vehicle and the driver.

The Mylapore traffic investigation police have filed a hit-and-run case and has launched a hunt for the driver of the bus. Kumar’s body has been sent to Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital for autopsy.

Following their complaints, our team went to the society and vaccinated the dogs. As per guidelines, we have to leave dogs back in the area. We can keep stray dogs under observation only if they show symptoms of rabies. ” Pratap Rathod, superintendent of Cattle Nuisance Control Department

For over two weeks now, septuagenarian Dipti Shah has been in self-imposed house arrest of sorts. As far as possible, she avoids going out of her residence. Reason: stray dog menace. She is not alone. Occupants of each of the 75 houses in Tulsi Row House inarea share her fear. Their fears are not unfounded.A fortnight ago, Shah had to leave forby an early morning flight when she was bitten by a dog. ""Just after I stepped out of my house to get into the car, a dog came running from nowhere and bit me hard even before I could register anything. I had to rush to the doctor and my travel plans fell flat,"" reveals Shah. Ever since, she is reluctant to step out, especially if she is alone.Residents claim that at least 10 people have been bitten by stray dogs since December last year. Repeated requests to thehave fallen on deaf ears. Such is the terror that even domestic helps, newspaper and vegetable vendors and cooks refuse to enter the society, they say.Revealing his ordeal, Anant Vaidya (65) says, ""I was going out with my wife when a bunch of dogs attacked me. My wife used her presence of mind and shooed them away."" He avers that the menace affects their society more as majority of the residents are senior citizens.Recalling another incident of dog bite which also became a huge embarrassment, he said that one of the guests at a wedding ceremony in the society was attacked. ""He was the son-in-law of the family. They were to go on a leisure trip to, but had to cancel the trip because of the incident,"" says Vaidya. He claims he had made several complaints to AMC about this menace but nothing happened about it. ""Being senior citizens, we would love to take a stroll in the society and outside. We could do that six months ago, but now we don't dare to walk around anymore. We also do not allow children to play in the society,"" he adds.Manoharsinh Rathod, a cook at one of the houses in the society for last 10 years, had a narrow escape when he was chased by a dog. ""After finishing my work on May 25, I was coming out of the house. A dog jumped on my bike and bit my leg. The dog refused to leave my leg. Due to the impact, I fell off the bike. Fortunately, my head was safe,"" he said. While he has resumed work at other places, he has refused to go back to this society, at least for now.AMC officials said that they can hardly do anything about it. Confirming receipt of the complaint, Pratap Rathod, superintendent of Cattle Nuisance Control Department (CNCD) of AMC, said, ""Following their complaints, our team went to the society and vaccinated the dogs. As per guidelines, we have to leave dogs back in the area we pick them from. We can keep stray dogs under observation only if they show symptoms of. In this case, we did not observe any such symptom and so we left them back in the area.""The number of dog bites in the city has seen an increase over the years. In 2015, AMC registered 50,209 cases of dog bite.The number rose to 52,639 in 2016 and to 56,180 in 2017. In the first four months of 2018, as many as 22,593 cases were reported."

CHANDIGARG: Smog kept air and train passengers on tenterhooks for the fourth consecutive day on Friday. While 12 trains and nine flights arrived late at Chandigarh, timings of 10 flights from Chandigarh International Airport had to be rescheduled due to poor visibility.

Kalka Shatabdi Express was once again late by around three hours. The train arrived at Chandigarh at 1.55pm against the scheduled arrival time of 11.05am.

Unchahaar Express running between Lucknow and Chandigarh reached the city beautiful after a delay of over 13 hours. Kalka Mail, Lucknow-Chandigarh Express and Bandra-Chandigarh Express reached six, three and five hours late, respectively.

The officials at Chandigarh Railway Station said the long distance trains have been running late for the past three days. The dense smog in Delhi has been delaying all the trains, added an official.

Out of nine flights which arrived late at the airport, seven flights were from Delhi. The other two flights were from Mumbai, said the spokesperson of Chandigarh International Airport Limited (CHIAL).

The officials said that bad weather conditions prevailing since the onset of winters have reduced the visibility and Delhi is the worst affected.

The poor visibility at Chandigarh airport also delayed the departure of 10 flights out of which six were Delhi-bound flights. GoAir, Jet Airways , Vistara flights saw late departure by 10 minutes to 54 minutes, said the spokesperson.

Bad weather has been giving hiccups to the airline operators at Chandigarh as the Airport Authority of India is yet to upgrade the CAT-ILS (Instruments Landing System) at the airport.

Delay in installation of CAT-ILS at the airport adds up to the delayed flight operations. The Airport Authority of India has extended the Notam (notice to airmen) till February 27, after the instrument landing system (ILS) installed on the runway developed a problem last week. Notam disallows aircraft to land with visibility below 2,400m, said an official.

NOIDA: Three criminals disguised as tenants entered a house on Thursday afternoon and held an elderly woman and her five-year-old granddaughter hostage, and fled with jewellery and valuables in Sector 19. According to police, the house owner Nitin Singhal is an engineer while his wife also works at a private company. They were at work when Singhal’s mother Suman Singhal (60) and daughter Manya (5) were at home at 2.30 pm.

The family members told police that the robbers went to Singhal’s house and asked his mother if there was a room available for rent. She told them that they do not give rooms on rent. The criminals then sought a glass of water but as soon as Suman turned around to fetch water, they entered the house and held her and her the child hostage.

A neighbour said the robbers locked the room from inside and held the victims hostage. “They scanned the entire house for half an hour and fled with gold, silver jewellery and Rs 40,000 cash,” he said. The woman informed her son and daughter-in-law after the criminals fled. Nitin Singhal rushed back home and informed police. The list of stolen items include gold bangles, rings, bracelet, among other items. A police team arrived at the house to gather evidence. There was no CCTV camera on the premises. The two victims were also rushed to district hospital for medical examination.

The family alleged that the police personnel registered a case of theft instead of robbery . Ajay Pal Sharma, SSP GB Nagar, said, “Action will be taken against accused official/clerk if the case was not registered under relevant sections,” he said.

HYDERABAD: A series of fatal accidents reported in the recent past has yet again turned the spotlight on Hyderabad's unruly traffic situation that, road users fear, is only getting worse by the day . Enraged by the frequency of violations, residents say how a sizeable population of the city's motorists not only pay little heed to traffic rules but also have no fear of the law.

Be it over speeding, particu larly during late hours of the day , jumping lanes without the use of indicators, drink and cellphone driving or not using safety gears (helmet, seatbelt etc), motorists in the city are spotted resorting to all forms of violation, the traffic personnel's routine checks and challans notwithstanding.

Hyderabad figures among the top 10 cities in India that record the highest number of road accidents every year, comes as no surprise. According to the Accidents India Report of 2016, the year saw as many as 3,000 (approx.) road accidents being reported from the city .

“Driving through most parts of Hyderabad is a nightmare. Motorists have no respect for traffic signals or the cops posted at these junctions. They do not even care about other motorists on the road. I have lived in multiple cities and nowhere have I seen such rash drivers who have no sense of lane driving or speed limits,“ said a Prateek Prakash , a banker who moved to the city three years ago.The Madhapur resident added: “And it isn't just cabs and buses that violate norms, even those driving private cars, many of them top-end brands, behave much the same way .“

Experts working in the area of road safety , couldn't agree more. Venting their angst against those resorting to such unruliness on the roads, they said how such occurrences show Hyderabad ­ aspiring to be a world-class city ­ in very poor light. “This is supposed to be a cosmopolitan city . But unless the people of the city realise that such attitude is unacceptable and must be amended, it is going to be difficult for Hyderabad to progress,“ said KRM Hari, assistant city planner, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC).

And it isn't the busy and congested stretches of the city alone that report rampant traffic violations. Even pockets with sufficient carriageway ­ including the expressways and ring road ­ are ridden with the same menace.

“The Paradise Junction in Secunderabad is particularly horrifying. Almost every day I feel insecure while driving through this junction that has cars coming in from all directions,“ said Alpa Gupta , a TATA projects employee.

Stressing the need for a change in attitude of commuters, traffic policemen say that it is the only way to address the situation. “We need to adopt defensive driving techniques and be aware of the pockets in the city where the traffic flow is generally heavy . Citizens have to be more proactive to ensure that the rate of accidents is curtailed,“ said A V Ranganath , deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Hyderabad.

Vadodara: Around a dozen robbers broke into a house in Ishwarpura village of Waghodiya taluka on Sunday midnight and escaped with cash and ornaments worth Rs 93,000.

The family members were held hostage and beaten up while the robbers were ransacking the safes and cupboards in the house.

According to police, the robbers entered the house of Natwar Vasava from the backdoor around Sunday midnight. Natwar and his wife Nandi were sleeping in the neighbouring house and his sons and mother were sleeping in the house that was targeted.

The robbers thrashed Natwar’s son Ravi and Ankit and his mother Vidya and snatched their gold and silver necklaces. Police said that Rs 2,000 cash and gold and silver ornaments worth Rs 62,000 that were kept in a safe were also stolen. They also broke into Natwar’s shop which is also on right beside of the house and stole Rs 1,000 from there.

When the family members shouted for help, their neighbours came out of their houses, some of the robbers pelted stones at them. As more number of people started coming out of their houses, the robbers started rushing out of the house to flee.

While fleeing also, the robbers thrashed three women on their way and stole their gold necklaces and earrings. “It was a large group and when they were fleeing, one group was targeting women, while another group was pelting stones,” said a police official.

In response, villagers too pelted stones at the robbers who were armed with sticks and similar objects. While fleeing towards Gajadra village, they also broke windshield and windows of a car.

Police sources said that six persons were injured in the attack and all of them were rushed to a private hospital in Waghodiya.

Eye-witnesses told police that the robbers were aged between 20 and 30 years and were talking in Hindi. Some of the robbers had worn woollen clothes and some of them had tied their pants to their waist and were donning shorts.

Highlights Pakistan has prevented a US diplomat, involved in a fatal road accident in Islamabad, from leaving the country

Hardline elements in Pakistan are insisting that American diplomat be prosecuted in the country

File photo

WASHINGTON: Pakistan is virtually holding an American diplomat hostage after preventing him from boarding a US military plane sent to bring him out of Islamabad, where he is sequestered at the US Embassy while the two sides are locked in a dispute over his diplomatic status and immunity issues.

Fraying ties between once-close allies saw a few more threads snap this weekend after what appeared to be a failed American rescue mission aimed at airlifting Col Joseph Emanuel Hall, a defence attaché at the US Embassy in Islamabad. Hall is accused of running a red light on April 7 while driving an SUV and knocking over a Pakistani national on a motorcycle, killing him.

When Hall’s credentials describe him as a diplomat, thus implying he enjoys immunity, Pakistan is contesting it even as the issue has become mired in local courts. At the very least, if Washington cannot waive the diplomatic immunity to enable him to be prosecuted in Pakistan, Islamabad wants a commitment that he will be tried in the US courts after he returns to America.

However, hardline elements in Pakistan are insisting that he be prosecuted in Pakistan. On Saturday, the Trump administration appeared to have won a reprieve from the more moderate elements in Pakistan who are keen to repair the damage the dispute has caused, and a C-130 military transport plane was sent from Bagram Air Force Base in Afghanistan to the Nur Khan Air Base in Chaklala outside Rawalpindi , to extricate Col Hall.

But word of the mission was leaked to the Pakistani media, and the jihadi press ran amuck with wall-to-wall coverage of what was virtually a rescue effort. When Col Hall reached the airbase with eight people from the U.S Embassy accompanying him, he was refused permission to board the aircraft, ostensibly under instructions from hardline elements of the Pakistan establishment. The aircraft eventually returned to Bagram.

Both sides have declined to comment on the matter, but the Dawn newspaper reported on Sunday, under the headline ''US diplomat’s bid to fly out of Pakistan foiled,'' that the Islamabad high court had a day earlier turned down a petition by the victim Ateeq Baig’s father seeking a direction for the government to put the diplomat’s name on the Exit Control List. Noting that Hall enjoyed diplomatic immunity, the court, however, asked the government to decide within two weeks whether or not Col Hall should be placed on the Exit Control List.

Col.Hall’s credentials, widely reproduced in the media, shows his diplomatic credentials are set to expire on May 31, 2018. The effort seems to be to keep him in Pakistan till that time.

The latest spat comes amid deteriorating ties between the two countries, with both sides restricting the movement of each other’s diplomats in their respective capitals, and the Trump administration seemingly determined to punish Pakistan for its terrorist infractions.

Earlier in the week, Islamabad made a song and dance about the UN Al-Qaida/ISIL Sanctions Committee not approving Pakistan’s proposal to list Umer Khalid Khorasani, aka Abdul Wali, the leader of Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, ostensibly because of US objection, although Pakistan itself continues to shield terrorists such as Hafiz Saeed and Masood Azhar.

The figures could not be independently confirmed.Police said the gunmen attacked the Holey Artisan restaurant in the Gulshan district of Dhaka, popular with expatriates, in an assault that began around 9pm local time on Friday. The assailants exchanged sporadic gunfire with police outside for several hours after the attack.The hostage crisis marks an escalation from a recent spate of murders claimed by Islamic State and al-Qaida on liberals, gays, foreigners and religious minorities, and could deal a major blow to the country's vital $25 billion garment sector.The restaurant assault also comes after Bangladesh hanged an Islamist party leader, Motiur Rahman Nizami, on May 11 for genocide and other crimes committed during a 1971 war of independence from Pakistan. That has drawn an angry reaction and some scattered violence from supporters. Nizami, 73, was a former legislator and minister during opposition leader Khaleda Zia's last term as prime minister.Last year, several Western retailers temporarily halted visits to Dhaka following the killing of two foreigners.Earlier on Friday, a Hindu priest was hacked to death at a temple in Jhinaidah district, 300km (188 miles) southwest of Dhaka.Both Islamic State and al Qaeda have claimed responsibility for many of the killings, although local authorities say no operational links exist between Bangladeshi militants and international jihadi networks.Bangladesh security officials say two local militant groups, Ansar-al-Islam and Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen, are behind the violence. Ansar pledges allegiance to al-Qaida, while Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen claims it represents Islamic State.""The bottom line is Bangladesh has plenty of local, often unaffiliated, militants and radicals happy to stage attacks in ISIS 's name,"" said Michael Kugelman, South Asia associate at The Wilson Centre in Washington DC, using an acronym commonly used for Islamic State.Islamic State had claimed more attacks in Bangladesh than in Pakistan or Afghanistan, he said.In Video: 20 killed in Dhaka cafe attack, 13 rescued"

GHAZIABAD: Armed assailants allegedly robbed a BSP worker’s wife of cash and valuables in broad daylight after holding her hostage at gunpoint when she was alone at home in Ghaziabad on Wednesday. The men allegedly looted Rs 5 lakh in cash and 1.5 kg of gold ornaments from the house of Amit Garg (42) and his wife Meenu (39).

The robbery took place at Garg’s residence in Nehru Nagar around 12 noon on Wednesday. Amit, a BSP worker who is also a contractor, had left for Bareilly on some work early in the morning, while their two sons were in school. According to family members, three men forcibly entered the ground-floor house when Meenu was talking on a mobile phone near the main door after seeing off her maid.

Amit is known to be a close confidante of former BSP MLA Suresh Bansal.

“The men held her at gunpoint and placed a knife against her throat. They inserted a pin-like thing in her arm that made her feel dizzy. They then took her to the kids’ washroom, where they tied her up with a rope. One of the men stood guard at the washroom. His accomplices ransacked the house, and they escaped with valuables through the rear door, which opens into a service lane,” Garg told TOI.

Meenu regained consciousness after around half-an-hour and began crying for help. Neighbors entered the house through the rear door and freed her. They then informed police.

Cops have recovered CCTV footage from the house, which has captured images of the men while they were escaping. A complaint has been lodged at Sihani Gate police station.

Ghaziabad police were yet to register an FIR at the time this report was being filed.

“We are trying to compute the exact quantum of loss of valuables after gathering details from the family. Images of two people have been captured in the CCTV footage that we have procured. An FIR will be registered under relevant sections of the IPC,” said Vinod Pandey, SHO of Sihani Gate police station.

Ferozepur: A field officer of Punjab Agriculture Development Bank (PADB) was allegedly taken hostage by nearly 300 farmers on Saturday, when he had gone to Mehma village, 22km from here, to recover installments from cultivators who had defaulted on farm debts.

The field officer, Peeyush Bansal, was released a few hours later, after police intervened and assured the farmers of the bank not sending any more officials to recover overdue loan amounts.

On the basis of a complaint submitted by PADB manager Ved Parkash, a case was registered against Mehma-based farmer Harnek Singh, who allegedly led the mob, and several unidentified people at Lakho Ke Behram police station on Sunday, according to SHO Ashok Kumar, the investigating officer of the case.

The cop confirmed that no arrest had been made so far. The SHO said they could not take any action against the mob because just getting Bansal out of the hostage situation was difficult. “We could not have made any arrests at that time. People were angry, and police action at such a time could have led to a law-and-order situation,” he said.

The farmers have said the bank official was insensitive and used “indecent language”, and this angered them so much that they took him hostage. Farmers from the village claimed that the government had asked bank employees not to go to houses of farmers for forcibly recovering loans, but they had not stopped visiting them.

The case has been registered under sections 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions) and 342 (wrongful confinement) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

In his statement to the police, the bank manager said Harnek Singh had already been booked by the police for detaining bank officials by locking a bank from inside at Guru Har Sahai in January. However, no arrest was made in that case too.

A security guard at the crime spot

GREATER NOIDA: A group of criminals stole copper wires worth several lakhs from an under-construction site after holding two security guards hostage at gunpoint in Kasna area of Greater Noida on Saturday night. The theft took place at Beta Plaza, an under-construction mall, in Sector Beta I.

Ankur Mittal, the site owner, said that the construction of six-storey building is nearing completion. He had hired two security guards from a private company three months ago.

On the intervening night of Saturday-Sunday at 1:58am, site manager Brajesh Singh received a call from one of the security guards informing that some criminals have attacked the premises. “The criminals have dumped us after tying our hands on our back,” the security guard said on phone.

The manager immediately dialed the site supervisor's number, but failed to connect. He then informed the owner and reached the spot. The officials found the two security guards’ hands tied on their back. Their legs were also tied and they were lying on the floor.

Soon around 20-30 workers gathered at the spot after receiving information. They inspected the site and found copper wires worth Rs 7.5 lakh missing from the warehouse. The investigation revealed that the CCTV camera wires of the warehouse were snapped at around 12:52am. The camera was moved in another direction to evade identification of suspects.

The two security guards soon fled the spot and also switched off their mobile phones. Goyal said that he suspects the involvement of security guards in the theft as how one of them managed to call the site manager when his hands were tied on his back. “We have serious doubt on them. They are also not cooperating in the investigation,” he said.

Jitendra Kumar, SHO Kasna police station, said that a police team visited the spot and took footage of CCTV cameras of other areas for investigation. “Investigation revealed 6-7 criminals in two cars had visited the construction site and decamped with valuables. Police have registered a case and investigating the matter. We are interrogating two security guards to know how the incident took place. We will take action against them if they are found involved in the crime,” he said.

Muslim militants have threatened to kill three more hostages in their jungle base in the southern Philippines,... Read More

MANILA: Muslim militants have threatened to kill three more hostages in their jungle base in the southern Philippines more than a week after beheading a Canadian man when their multimillion dollar ransom demands were not met.

In a video circulated on Tuesday by the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors jihadi websites, the captives from Canada, Norway and the Philippines pleaded for the Canadian and Philippine governments to heed the Abu Sayyaf militants' demand.

Six heavily armed Abu Sayyaf jihadists stood behind the hostages, who were made to sit in a clearing and spoke briefly before a camera. A black flag hang in the backdrop of banana trees and lush foliage.

Norwegian hostage Kjartan Sekkingstad said that if the kidnappers' demand was not met, ""we will be executed like our friend John.""

The militants beheaded John Ridsdel on April 25 in the southern Philippine province of Sulu, an impoverished Muslim province in the south of the largely Roman Catholic country, after they failed to get a ransom of 300 million pesos ($6.3 million).

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned the killing but vowed not to give in to the kidnappers' ransom demands. Following the beheading, the Philippine military launched an offensive, which security officials believe have killed more than a dozen gunmen so far.

Canadian captive Robert Hall asked the Philippine government to ""please stop shooting at us and trying to kill us. They're gonna do a good job at that."" He asked his government to heed the militants' demand.

Holding back tears, Filipino Marites Flor asked several officials and prominent Philippine personalities, including local presidential candidates, for help ""because we want to be freed alive.""

A masked militant warned Canada and the Philippines that the three remaining hostages would be killed ""if you procrastinate once again.""

It was the first time, the three captives were shown in a video after Ridsdel's killing.

The four were seized from a marina on southern Samal Island and taken by boat to Sulu, where Abu Sayyaf gunmen continue to hold several captives, including a Dutch bird watcher who was kidnapped more than three years ago, and eight Indonesian and Malaysian crewmen who were snatched recently from three tugboats.

The militants freed 10 Indonesian tugboat crewmen a few days ago reportedly in exchange for ransom.

The United States and the Philippines have separately blacklisted the Abu Sayyaf for kidnappings for ransom, beheadings and bombings. The brutal group emerged in the early 1990s as an extremist offshoot of a decades-long Muslim separatist rebellion in the south.

ALLAHABAD: A gang of eight armed robbers looted Rs 8 lakh from the Gramin Shakha of Bank of Baroda in Sahrua in Pratapgarh district after taking staff and customers hostage at gun point on Wednesday afternoon.

The robbers also threatened the bank staff of dire consequences when they resisted to hand over the cash to the outlaws.

Senior police officials, including SP (Pratapgarh), along with forces of three police stations and forensic experts rushed to the spot and carried out investigations.

Additional DG (Prayagraj Zone) SN Sabat said, “A gang of armed and masked robbers came to the bank on three or four bikes and looted around Rs 8 lakh cash. He added that special police teams have been constituted to crack the case.

Pratapgarh police, meanwhile, maintained the robbers had entered bank at around 2.37pm and escaped after looting the cash within 15 minutes.

“Apart from the bank staff, as many as three or four customers were inside the bank when the robbers struck. However, no security guard was on duty. The robbers, who were carrying country-made pistols, damaged a computer monitor and one of them even entered into cash counter. The robbers had brought two bags to carry the cash and put entire money into these bags.

The entire bank dacoity was recorded in the CCTV.

“Cops are scanning the CCTV footage to compile clues regarding the bank dacoity” said a senior cop adding “police have already quizzed the bank staff to ascertain the identities of robbers and found that two of them were middle-aged” he added.

“We have obtained some CCTV footage and sought the assistance of police from neighbouring districts. As many as three police teams have been constituted to crack the bank dacoity. A series of raids have been carried out in Vishwanathganj and adjoining areas,” he added.

Eyewitnesses told police two of the robbers stationed themselves near the main gate, the others held the bank staff and customers captive at gun point. All of them had covered their faces expect eyes and were talking in local dialect. They threatened to open fire if anyone dared to raise alarm.

The robbers were well acquainted with the layout of the bank and escaped unchallenged.

NEW DELHI: The IL&FS hostage crisis in Ethiopia appeared far from over despite the distressed group on Monday transferring money to pay one month’s salary. The Indian expats held hostage were not released as the local workers are demanding that IL&FS Transportation Network Ltd-Elsamex clear dues for two months — October and November.Sources told TOI the company is in contact with local authorities and Ethiopian police to arrange for a safe passage for its Indian employees who are under house arrest in their camps, while IL&FS arranges for more funds to settle the salary dues.At least five Indian expats working for two road projects in Ethiopia have now been captive for over a week as ITNL and Elsamex have failed to clear salary and other statutory payments for several months. The Indian expats also have unpaid salary claims since July with some of the arrears dating back to April.An IL&FS spokesperson declined to comment.Sources, however, said that efforts have been mounted to arrange funds at a war footing. On Friday, Exim Bank of India asked Commercial Bank of Ethiopia to come to the rescue of IL&FS.“Exim Bank is agreeable to permit the withdrawal from the accounts, after they are adequately funded, towards meeting immediate pressing dues, that is, payment of salary, statutory and local dues in Ethiopia,” Exim Bank deputy managing director Debasish Mallick told TOI.Exim Bank had invoked guarantee amount $31.7 million and guarantee commission of over $285,000 due to the problems at the IL&FS Group, which have led to a series of repayment defaults. But the amount in the bank account was not sufficient with just around $230,000 at the end of November."

Strap: Had Raided Village To Nab Cattle Thieves, Rescued By Additional Police Force

Meerut: A four-member Delhi Police team, led by an ASI, and two dairy farm owners from the national capital were on Friday attacked and held hostage for hours in a Meerut village after they went there looking for cattle thieves. ASI of Delhi’s Samaypur Badli police station, Lakhan Singh, a head constable and two constables raided Madiyayi village near Meerut’s Sardhana town to arrest suspected cattle thieves. Two owners of dairy farms, from where the cattle were stolen, were also with the raiding team.

“The police team, which included two constables in plain clothes, were overpowered by the villagers and held captive at an undisclosed location. Later, additional force was sent from Sardhana police station and the policemen were rescued,” said Rajesh Kumar, superintendent of police (rural). A suspected cattle thief, Ramzaan, was also arrested.

Later in the day, an FIR was registered on the basis of a complaint filed by the Delhi Police team for the attack on them.

“An FIR under IPC sections 307 (attempt to murder), 336 (acts endangering life and safety of others), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 7 criminal law amendment act was registered at Sardhana police station,” the SP said.

Dehradun: A group of four masked men wielding pistols barged into the office of a finance company in the heart of Rajpur Road on Friday afternoon and held eight people, including customers and staff, hostage for over an hour. The unidentified men decamped with a gold chain, Rs 47,000 in cash and the digital video recorder of CCTV cameras installed inside the office of the company.

SP (city) Pradeep Rai told TOI, “We are scanning CCTV footage from nearby places. A team of Special Operations Group (SOG) will also investigate the matter.”

According to police, at 11.45am a masked man entered the office of the firm in Meedo Plaza near Behl Chowk and pointed a gun at the receptionist. A few seconds later, three of his accomplices also entered the building and held the staff and customers hostage. The hostages were asked to kneel down and put their hands on their heads.

The miscreants then snapped the wires of all four CCTV cameras installed inside the office premises. They took Rs 47,000 in cash from the main counter but were unable to access a safe that required a code to open. The branch manager refused to give them the security code, upon which the men rained blows on him. They thereafter fled with the cash and a gold chain.

Police officials said that forensic experts had been called to collect evidence related to the crime and an investigation was ongoing.

Greater Noida: A contractor , who works with Noida Authority , and his friend were waylaid, taken hostage and robbed at gunpoint by a gang of three men while they were returning from Aligarh to Noida in a Hyundai Verna car on Thursday night. The victims, Ravindra Singh (45) and his friend Hoshiyar Singh (44), were ambushed by criminals near Tilapta Chowk in Dadri area. Ravindra, a resident of Sector 71, was returning after meeting his sister in Aligarh. Abhishek Singh, Ravindra’s son, said his father and his friend had left Aligarh at around 8pm and reached Tilapta Chowk at 10.45pm.

“There were a number of potholes near the chowk and it was difficult to navigate through. After some time, I applied brakes and stopped the car. Hoshiyar Singh got down from the car to check the road. Suddenly three criminals appeared in front of us and took us at gunpoint,” Ravindra said. The criminals, who came there on foot, dumped both of them in the rear seat of the car and took control of the vehicle. Ravindra said they snatched his two mobile phones—Apple and Intex—a RADO wrist watch, ATM cards, pan card, aadhar card and Rs 800 cash. They also snatched Hoshiyar’s Samsung mobile phone, Rs 600, ATM card and driving licence. The criminals then drove the vehicle to some agricultural field and held them there for some time. Later they took the two to Lal Kuan area in Ghaziabad in the same car and stopped near an ATM kiosk of Punjab National Bank.

“The two criminals took me to the ATM while one stood guard to my friend in the car. They withdrew Rs 23,000 in four transactions after asking PIN from me. When they were busy in transactions, I fled from the ATM kiosk and raised an alarm to alert local people. The two criminals got scared and immediately got into the car and drove away with Hoshiyar,” he said.

On the way, they thrashed Hoshiyar Singh and later dumped him in a deserted location near Amka village.

Meanwhile, Ravindra found two police personnel on patrol duty on the roadside and informed them about the incident. The policemen immediately launched a search and located Hoshiyar Singh and informed Surajpur police. The duo said they were united at around 3.30 am. Later they reached police station and filed a case against unknown criminals.

Amit Kishor Shrivastava, circle officer 1, Greater Noida , said a case of robbery has been registered under Section 392 of IPC at Surajpur police station. “We have formed a team and started investigation. We are scanning footage of CCTV cameras in the area to identify the criminals,” he said.

BHOPAL: A trigger-happy husband allegedly took a student and guard hostage at gunpoint in a school in MP’s Bhind because his wife refused to drop her class and leave with him. He fired shots in the air as he walked out of campus, threatening a massacre, witnesses have told police.

The shooter, Kishan Shakya , is on the run with a .315 rifle and, by the looks of it, plenty of ammunition. He, too, is a teacher. Guns — even gunfire — are an everyday sight for the people of Bhind, a district in Chambal region with the largest number of licensed firearms (22,800), but the school shooting rattled them as well.

Police said Kishan and his wife Aradhna Verma have a strained relationship and are living separately for the last few months. On Saturday, Kishan landed up at Gata Middle School, where Aradhna teaches. It was 11am and the school was holding an exam. Aradhna was in a classroom when she saw her husband barge in, armed with a rifle and shouting for her. She tried to run but he grabbed her and demanded that she come with him, say police.

Aradhna refused and fled to the teachers’ room where she locked herself in. Furious, Kishan allegedly tried to go after her but guard Nathuram Bothom blocked him, only to have the rifle barrel poking his chest. A Class IX student, Jaiveer Gurjar, bravely came forward to defend his teacher and told Kishan point-blank to “stop terrorizing the school”.

In reply, Kishan allegedly placed the barrel on his chest and told him to step aside. The guard and student stood their ground. Frustrated, Kishan allegedly fired a few shots in the air and walked out, warning that he would return and “kill everyone”.

“I was in the classroom when he stormed in, grabbed my wrist and tried to drag me along. I resisted and rushed into another room and bolted it from inside. He created a scene outside the room and took the guard and a student at gunpoint,” his wife Anuradha told mediapersons. Jaiveer said: “He was trying to take our teacher forcefully. When I objected and reminded him that it was a school, he pointed his gun at me.”

Mehgaon police station in-charge Narendra Tripathi said that a case has been registered against Kishan on the basis of the statements of his wife, the guard and student. “It seems that there are differences between the husband and wife. We are investigating it and hope to nab him,” Tripathi told TOI.

When the news spread in the region, some parents approached the school authorities and said that they won’t send their kids until security arrangements are made.

The MS Complex where the robbers attacked the victims and held them hostage before robbing them.

AGRA: Police initiatives to curb crime in the city are being challenged by the criminals, as a group of armed robbers barged inside a local businessman home and held him and his mother hostage at gunpoint before making away with valuables and cash over Rs 3 lakh.

The incident took place in Bombay Market (M S Complex) area of Jagdispura on Sikandra-Bodla Road at around afternoon.

Manoj Sharma, who lives on the second floor of M S complex along with his mother, said, “On Monday, a couple of men came to our apartment for a permission to set up ‘ bhandara ’ in front of our building. The same men along with two others barged inside our home and robbed us. In the confrontation, one of the robbers suffered bullet injury after his pistol misfired, but all the four managed to run away.”

“They locked us in the bathroom and took away Rs 1.5 lakh cash, four gold rings, one chain and other items,” said Sharma.

According to superintendent of police Agra city Kunwar Anupam Singh, “It was a pre-planned robbery. The robbers had recced the victim’s apartment and surrounding area. They knew that currently only two people live in the apartment and the victim is a businessman who owns the complex as well.”

“Police have cordoned off the area and teams are working to nab the accused. It is very much possible the robbers may visit any private clinic or hospital for first aid, as one of them have suffered bullet injury. As soon any lead is received, we will act accordingly,” he said.

Last year, 278 home break-in and 129 loot incidents were reported, including at least three cases of armed robbers attacking family members to rob them in their home.

BHUBANESWAR: With cash in short supply, a group of villagers in Kalahandi district decided to take matters into their own hands.

Villagers in Kasibahal on Saturday took sarpanch Balabhadra Patel hostage, demanding kerosene in exchange of paddy. The villagers freed him after a five-hour drama and only after getting assurance from block development officer ( BDO ) Raghunath Mundary that he would facilitate the sale of paddy so that the villagers could buy kerosene.

Reports claimed the villagers had gone to the local panchayat demanding that they be given kerosene in exchange of paddy since they don't have money to buy it. They are mostly labourers who don't have their own farmland. They get paid in cash and a portion of the paddy they help harvest in the agricultural fields of big landlords. Since money has been a problem this time, landlords have been unable to hand them cash and the marginal farmers had to settle for paddy instead.

In Kasibahal 98 per cent of the people depend on farming. The panchayat comes under Koksara block, where there are three ATMs, including one operated by the State Bank of India. Kasibahal village is about 20 km from the block headquarters, and is serviced by only one ATM.

""As landlords too are struggling to arrange funds, they have been unable to give cash to the marginal farmers. Moreover, the ATMs too have been unable to meet the requirement otherwise the villagers would have had some cash to buy essential items like kerosene,"" Mundary told TOI.

The villagers demanded that they be given kerosene in exchange of paddy. But the panchayat doesn't indulge in barter system. Enraged, the villagers then took the sarpanch hostage.

""We have never given kerosene by taking paddy in return. This is against the rule,"" said the BDO adding he has discussed the issue with the Primary Agricultural Credit Society (Pacs), which buys paddy from farmers on minimum support price (MSP) fixed by the government, since marginal farmers are not registered to sell their paddy in PACS mandis.

AGRA: As a havaldar with the 1871 Rocket regiment of the Artillery, Avadesh Yadav 's job was to provide cover fire to the infantry. In the 20 hours that he held his wife Meena, daughter Priya, son Ankul, wife Meena and father Ramadin hostage at gun point along with two members of his landlord's family in Etah, those images must have played on his mind. He kept saying, ""Dushmano ne gher liya...piche haato...mein cover fire deta hoon (Enemies have surrounded us, step back, I will give cover fire)"". And then he would fire a round.The long, frightening night for the family of Yadav and his landlord at Yadavnagar, Etah (UP), that began on Monday came to an end on Tuesday after a SWAT team quickly scrambled together by the administration and aided by 60 policemen slithered down the terrace and apprehended him. The security personnel had refrained from taking more drastic action against the former soldier as he was trained and armed with a 315 bore rifle from which he had fired 11 shots.Priya, 18, and Ankul, 15, meanwhile established contact with cops outside, who told them to try and somehow hide their father's gun. The moment they did that, the SWAT team that had already made its way to the terrace came down and pinned him to the ground.After a preliminary investigation, police said Yadav, who retired in January 2014 from Nasirabad, seemed to have ""lost his mental balance that may have been triggered by something"". Sanjay Kumar, deputy superintendent of police, Etah, told TOI: “On Monday, at around 2.30 pm, Awadesh Yadav held hostage six persons, including his family members and landlord, at gunpoint. He fired shots (in the air) after which personnel from five police stations, fire brigade and a SWAT team were roped it. We tried to persuade Yadav, but he refused to listen. It took 60 cops to capture him and end the drama.”Kumar added,“Yadav, who was working with Bharat Petroleum in Delhi, seemed to be mentally unstable so we had to rule out offensive measures. That was also because six innocent people were being held hostage by him. We finally managed to contact his two teenage children and asked them to hide his rifle. Once the kids confirmed to us that they had successfully done that, our teams barged in from the roof and later the ground floor. We were ready with grill cutters and all men entered the house at one go.”On the condition of anonymity, an immediate neighbour of Yadav said, “Yadav came to Etah on Sunday evening by bus as his family followed him in a car. Yadav had fired shots in his Delhi residence too. On Monday afternoon, he suddenly picked up his gun and fired again. Before anyone could understand anything, he took his family and landlord hostage. The family is in trauma.”Station officer of Kotwali Nagar police station Pankaj Kumar Mishra said, “On Saturday, too, Yadav had fired in his rented home (in Delhi). He was working for Bharat Petroleum at their Dwarka office. His landlord panicked and called for the ex-Armyman's family in Etah to fetch him from Delhi. While heading home, Yadav took his gun along and boarded a UP roadways bus. He believed his family would kill him.”Kamlesh Yadav, the younger brother of Awadesh, said, “Nearly a decade ago, a similar incident had forced us to take him to hospital, but after brief a period of medication he was normal. However, he would often say that enemies have surrounded us and we need to retaliate.”A military source said, “Since Awadesh retired nearly four years ago, we don’t know about his medical record during service in the Army.”"

AGRA :The family of a 28-year-old man, Azad Khan, from Aligarh , who is being allegedly tortured and kept captive by a sheikh in Saudi Arabia has approached the Union minister of external affairs, Sushma Swaraj , to seek his release. Khan’s family has also filed a police complaint in this regard.

According to Azad’s wife, Ghazala, who is pregnant, he was recruited as a driver by Delhi based agency, Al Jiara International, for a sheikh in Saudi Arabia. She said that Azad had sent a video in which he is pleading his family to “rescue” him from his employer, who allegedly tortures him and forces him to do menial household jobs. He also stated that he is not being paid or fed properly. She said that her husband’s passport and visa has also been “seized” by the sheikh.

Talking to TOI, superintendent of police (Rural), Yashveer Singh said that matter is being inquired. Azad’s wife told police that the Delhi based company had sent him to Saudi and the same is being verified.

She told TOI that her family’s financial condition was bad and one of their relatives in Aligarh suggested her husband to go to Saudi for better earning. She said, “his condition is bad, he has a head injury and no one is there to take care of him”.

Gazala said that her husband had opened a hardware shop in Aligarh after borrowing money but the business did not take off. “We are 11 members in the family including our three small children and he is the eldest son of his parents and has the responsibility of all,” said Gazala adding that they had paid Rs One lakh to the agency after borrowing money from friends and relatives.

When contacted, Imtiaz Ul Islam, proprietor of Delhi based agency, Al Jiara International refused to comment on Azad’s matter and said he can not provide any details of him.

NEW DELHI: When the white Indica drew near their white Swift Dzire, the two men holding a scared Delhi University student hostage inside got out to get their hands on the ransom they had demanded. For half an hour that Thursday night, Mohammad Rafee and Akash, fearing a police trap, had got the Indica to follow them from the original ransom drop spot at Shastri Nagar to a lonely park in Bhajanpura. When the door of the Indica opened, out stepped a child, or so it seemed. As the two parties eyed each other warily, the young hostage loosened himself from his abductors’ grip, and before they could react, gun shots rang out.On the other side, Ayisha Falaq, 33, trembled, her .32 bore pistol still hot in her hand. The national-level shooter-cum-coach had shot one of the men on his waist, the other in his foot. She had instinctively pulled out the licensed gun she habitually carried in her purse and shot at the men who had held her 21-year-old brother-in-law Asif hostage for five hours. “When we got the ransom call, Ayisha was afraid, but insisted that it would be she who would hand over the money to Asif’s abductors,” Falaq Sher Alam, Ayisha’s husband, told TOI on Saturday.Recalling the frantic moment, Ayisha said, “Asif was shocked to see me shooting at the men. He immediately ran towards me and held me tight. He was shivering with fear, and so was I.” Police, who had been following Ayisha and her husband, swooped in and collared the injured Rafee and Akash before they could hobble their way to the Dzire.The cops have seized the pistol from Ayisha. “Investigation is in progress to establish whether Ayisha fired the shots in self-defence to save Asif’s life. If it is so, she will be protected under the law,” said Ravindra Yadav, joint commissioner (Eastern Range).Asif had been taken hostage by the two men earlier that night. A student of Delhi University by day, Asif earned some pocket money by driving a cab after classes. On Thursday night, he got a booking in Daryaganj and left his home at Minto Road to pick up Rafee and Akash. Halfway, they asked him to take a different route and he protested, but they brusquely told him to shut up.“I immediately stopped the car and refused to go ahead from that point,” said the 21-year-old. One of the men shoved him to the front passenger seat and threatened to kill him. “The men laughed in an evil manner and asked me to enjoy the last moments of my life,” said Asif, still shivering at the memory.At Bhopra border, the men stopped the car and took Asif’s wallet, only to find it held just Rs 150. Angered that their efforts had yielded so little, Rafee and Akash beat the youngster and forced him to make a ransom call to his family.“Around 1 am we received a call from Asif’s phone,” remembered Ayisha. “Someone asked us to reach Shastri Park in an hour with Rs 25,000 if we wanted to see Asif alive.” Family members first thought Asif was playing a prank on them. But the seriousness of the situation quickly sank in and they immediately called the police control room.“The cops asked us to go to Shastri Park with the money. They said they would deploy plainclothes men at the designated spot,” said Alam. When Ayisha and her husband reached there, the kidnappers suspected the presence of cops and drove away. Alam tailed the car, and was, in turn, discreetly followed by the cops.Police were on the spot almost as soon as Ayisha had shot the goons. “Officer Anant Mittal, an IPS trainee, and his team arrived when the shooting was taking place,” said Joint CP Yadav. “The two men tried to escape despite being injured, but they were nabbed.” Senior police officers applauded the bravery of the woman shooter in rescuing her relative.In Video: Delhi: Woman shoots abductors, rescues hostage"

LUCKNOW: Eight armed robbers attacked the house of a property dealer, took the family hostage and fled with cash and jewellery worth lakhs in Vivek Khand, Gomtinagar , on early Monday. The robbers took Rs 2.50 lakh and jewellery worth Rs 20 lakh, said police.

The robbers, who wore masks, struck at 3/38 in Vivek Khand. The two-storey house belongs to Chaman Lal Diwakar, who stays with his wife Sunita and their four children, Komal, Priya, Kajal and Piyush.

“The robbers scaled boundary of the house for entry. They trained guns on us and asked us to stay in the bed. They assaulted me when I tried to resist them,” Chamanlal said, adding, “The robbers tied me with a string and held my wife Sunita at gunpoint and took her to search for areas stashed with cash and jewellery.”

Circle officer, Gomtinagar, Satyasen Yadav said an organised gang, which escapes to other districts after executing robberies in the city, could be involved in the crime.

Opposition creating ruckus only to be in headlines, chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi said at a press conference... Read More

LUCKNOW: Infuriated over continuous disruption of proceedings of the state assembly by protesting members of the Samajwadi Party for the second consecutive day on Friday, an agitated chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi warned them for holding the House hostage and pleaded Speaker Hridaya Narain Dixit to take serious note of it.

Yogi said the Opposition is running away from the House as they fear that their scandals and corruption in their regime would get exposed. “Why this behaviour when they all decided at the all-party meeting to let the House function smoothly,” asked Yogi.

Earlier, amidst slogan shouting and uproarious scenes despite repeated reminders from the chair and parliament affairs minister Suresh Khanna to keep calm, SP MLAs led by Ram Govind Chaudhary and Azam Khan demanded withdrawal of the increase in power tariff and refused to retreat leading to adjournment of house till Monday.

The first two days of the winter Assembly session have been consigned to pandemonium with SP and Congress MLAs running into the Well of the House.

On the first day of the Assembly on Thursday Yogi left the House amidst display of banners slogan shouting by the Opposition, after having failed to address the House.

On Friday, as portests broke out again, Yogi mounted an attack on them by warning that this is not the way to run the House. “How can just a handful od 47 members (of the Samajwadi Party) hijack the entire functioning. This is denial of democratic rights of others and issues related to people. I would request the Speaker to take note of it seriously,” the CM said.

“When the government is ready to face any question from the Opposition and give replies, why are they running away from a debate? Are they Afraid of their scams getting exposed?” he asked.

Yogi said the Opposition is unnecessarily blowing the issue of power tariff increase out of proportion as the state government is providing cheapest electricity with increased supply hours.

Later, in an informal interaction with mediapersons, Yogi said the Samajwadi Party led-Opposition was indulging in slogan shouting and raising the power tariff issue merely to hog headlines.

KOLKATA: A cave-in in the western flank of Diamond Harbour Road in Thakupukur around 6am on Thursday led to a massive snarl on the vital north-south corridor. A retinue of engineers and police personnel swung into action to salvage the situation. The road was already distressed due the construction of the Joka-BBD Bag Metro corridor.

Currently, both-way traffic is directed along the western flank of the road as the eastern flank being concretized. More than 20sqft area of the road sunk in around 5ft deep on the 90ft flank, leaving only one lane left for the movement of vehicles. Even after the cops diverted the office-bound vehicles around James Long Sarani the snarl lasted the entire day.

Prima facie it seems the cave-in might be a result of the subsidence of sand after the laying the sewage line under the Kolkata Environment Improvement project. “A void might have been created due to water leakage. We are trying ascertain the exact cause and come up with a remedy,” said an engineer.

Jitesh Roy of Dakshinpara, whose house is not far from the spot, left his home in panic till the KMC engineers assured him of no further possibility of cave-in. “I feared the house would collapse with us inside,” said Roy. A KMC engineer said the cave-in might progress southwards. “We have taken all precautionary measures.”

Local councillor Ghanashree Bag said the collapse may be due to improper landfill.

MEERUT: Even when the total count of dengue deaths in Delhi stood at 32, this village in Meerut claims more than 50 people have succumbed to the deadly fever here this year so far. With district administration being in denial mode and saying that not a single dengue death has been reported in the district, angry residents of Kastla village held a six-member team of doctors who visited the village to take a stock of the situation on Tuesday hostage for several hours. The chief medical officer has now ordered a probe.

Deepak Kastla, a villager, said, “Hardly two doctors visit the primary health centre here. Instead of the pharmacist who hardly shows up, the sweeper distributes medicines among us. The villagers were seething with anger. So when the team of doctors visited us, we held them hostage until senior health authorities came here and listened to our grievances.”

The team of doctors remained were released only after the additional chief medical officer reached the village and pacified the locals.

Situated 20 km away from Meerut, Kastla village has a total population of 5,000 and villagers say there is hardly any house which does not have a dengue patient. A family of 25 persons drawn from three generations claimed that everybody in their house was suffering from dengue.

The village head, Gajendra Nagar, said, “I was myself admitted to a private hospital when I had dengue. At least 50 people have died here due to dengue in the last two months and over 400 persons are suffering from the disease. But not even a single health official visited us.”

Additional chief medical officer Sanjay Jodha, who rushed to the village to procure the release of doctors, told TOI, “We inspected the village hospital which was found to be deplorable. I have transferred the medical officer and suspended the pharmacist for being absent from his work for a long time. Also, instructions have been given for fogging and cleaning of the village.”

District malaria officer Rajesh Sharma denied the reports of dengue deaths and said, “Hardly two cases of dengue have been reported from Kastla village. Even those two are not confirmed.”

Chief medical officer Ramesh Chandra said, “An inquiry has been set up to find out the truth. If any such death is confirmed, necessary action will be taken against the concerned authorities.”

Sunita Goyal shows her ransacked house

LUDHIANA: Seven armed robbers held a family of three hostage and escaped with cash and jewellery in Durga Colony, Focal Point, in the small hours of Friday.

Pankaj Goyal, a garment trader, was in Delhi for a business work and his wife Sunita Goyal was alone at home with her two sons, aged 14 and 10, when the robbers struck. ""Our tenants live on the ground floor and we on the first. I was sleeping with my children when around 12.45am seven masked men woke us up.""

The burglars placed a ladder in a neighbouring house to gain entry to the Goyal's lobby. The open door of one of the rooms made their task easy. Two of them were armed with pistols and as many with knives. ""One of them pointed a gun at me and the other at my children. They asked me to give them Rs 5 lakh. When I told them that we don't have the amount, one of them said, 'Goyals have enough money'. Then the five others started searching my house. They took away Rs 1.50 lakh cash, 10-tola gold , 1.5kg silver from the almirah and an LCD. Before fleeing, they removed the SIM card from my mobile.""

Neighbours rushed to their house and called up the police after the family raised the alarm. Assistant commissioner of police (Sahnewal) Gurmeet Singh Kangra said the CCTV cameras installed in the locality have captured the robbers. ""The footage shows the burglars climbing down the ladder with the loot. All of them were masked and are yet to be identified.""

WASHINGTON: US President Barack Obama has appointed a diplomat to the newly created post of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs which will analyse and find effective remedies to hostage issues.

Jim O'Brien , a seasoned diplomat, was appointed as the First Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs after government's comprehensive hostage policy review which was completed earlier this summer.

""That review recognised the need for fully coordinated action across US agencies in responding to hostage situations and to the military, diplomatic, legal, and humanitarian issues that such situations generate,"" Secretary of State John Kerry said.

Kerry said that O'Brien is exactly the right person for a job that demands a high level of diplomatic experience and the ability to analyse and find effective remedies to complex problems.

""In his new position, Jim will be focused on one over riding goal: using diplomacy to secure the safe return of Americans held hostage overseas,"" Kerry added.

To that end, he will be in close contact with the families of American hostages, meet with foreign leaders in support of our hostage recovery efforts, advise on options to enhance those efforts, participate in strategy meetings with other senior US policymakers, and represent the US internationally on hostage-related issues.

The new Special Presidential Envoy will work closely with the inter agency Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell that was also created as a result of the hostage policy review.

O'Brien is currently vice chair of the Albright Stonebridge Group, a global strategy and business advisory firm.

Previously, he served as Special Presidential Envoy for the Balkans in the late 1990s, helping to chart a path out of the military and political strife that divided the region.

He also served as Deputy Director of the State Department's Office of Policy Planning and as a senior adviser to UN Ambassador and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.

He helped to formulate the 1995 Dayton Accords, which ended the war in Bosnia; and guided US support for the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, which helped bring to justice persons responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity."

NOIDA: Four men took a driver hostage at gunpoint and snatched a Toyota Innova from him near Gardens Galleria mall on Friday. The SUV belonged to a leading Hindi daily and used by its chief general manager Nitendra Shrivastava.

The four accused overpowered the driver near the mall around 4.30pm on Friday. While one accused drove away in the SUV, three others held the driver hostage inside their car, a white Maruti Ertiga. They roamed around the city in the Ertiga for three hours before ditching the driver in Raj Nagar Extension, Ghaziabad, at around 7.30pm.

The driver, Ramu, lives with his family in Mayur Vihar Phase I in Delhi. He has been working as a driver with the Hindi newspaper for 20 years.

Ramu said that his boss’s family was visiting the Gardens Galleria mall for shopping. “I was waiting outside for the family. At around 4.20pm, four persons approached me in a white Maruti Ertiga. They wanted me to show them the route to Greater Noida,” he said. As he was explaining the route, the criminals caught Ramu’s hand and pulled him inside the Ertiga. “They immediately overpowered me and held me hostage in the backseat,” he said.

One of the accused snatched the Innova’s key from him and drove away in it while three others remained with Ramu in the Ertiga. He said that soon, his boss’s family was calling him on his mobile number. “The criminals snatched away my phone and received the call before disconnecting it. The family called again and the criminals disconnected the phone again. The third time they got angry and removed the SIM card from the mobile phone and threw it outside,” he said. According to Ramu, the criminals started driving on the Noida-Greater Noida expressway.

“The criminals put some toxic substance in a handkerchief and pressed it against my nose till I became unconscious,” Ramu said. The men allegedly drove the car to Noida and Greater Noida before throwing him out in Raj Nagar Extension, Ghaziabad.

After gaining consciousness, Ramu took a lift from a biker to a nearby police chowki. The police took him to Dainik Jagran’s Noida office at 9 pm. The management of the newspaper soon lodged a complaint at Sector 39 police station.

Avnish Dixit, SHO, Sector 39 police station, said a case of robbery was registered. “We have formed three teams and launched a search to arrest the criminals,” he said.

Highlights The US media had expressed skepticism about the rescue story dished out by the Pakistani military

Half a dozen drone strikes have rained missiles in Pakistan’s Kurram Agency following the rescue

Foreign minister Khwaja Asif said that the strikes are in indeterminate territory since the borders with Afghanistan are poorly demarcated

WASHINGTON: The Trump administration has dramatically ramped up drone strikes on Pakistan in the past week after the rescue of a Canadian-American couple and their three children, purportedly with Islamabad’s help. High-intensity and frequent strikes -- of the kind not seen since 2010, when they averaged two a week -- have resumed, amid signs that things are not all hunky-dory between the two countries despite both sides talking nice on the rescue issue.

Half a dozen drone strikes have rained missiles in Pakistan’s Kurram Agency following the rather shady “rescue” of the Canadian-American couple by the Pakistani military, which initially claimed that they were freed after a firefight with Taliban when they were being transported across the Pak-Afghan border. The “rescue” was reportedly based on US intelligence inputs, resulting in the interception of the vehicle on the Pakistani side of the border, and culminating in a clash in which all the hostage-takers were conveniently either reported killed or escaped.

But the Trump administration embarrassed Islamabad by publicly calling out Pakistan’s lies, with both Vice President Mike Pence and CIA Director Mike Pompeo saying the couple (and their three children) was being held in Pakistan, and not Afghanistan. “The Vice President thanked (Pakistan’s Prime Minister) Abbasi for his government's assistance in recovering US and Canadian hostages that were being held captive by the Haqqani Taliban Network in the tribal areas of Pakistan,” a White House readout of Pence’s call to the Pakistani leader said.

There was no mention of Afghanistan or their crossing the border into Pakistan, and CIA director Mike Pompeo, too, confirmed the hostages were being held inside Pakistan, while demanding that Pakistan deny safe havens to the Taliban.

There was also an ominous note in the Pence readout. “Vice President Pence noted this effort as an important development in Pakistan's support to the US strategy against terrorism in the region, but highlighted that cooperation against militant groups must be continued and sustained,” it said. “Just as he did during the meeting the two had in New York last month, the Vice President again discussed ways that Pakistan could work with the United States and others to bolster stability and security for all in South Asia.”

The US media had expressed skepticism about the rescue story dished out by the Pakistani military, given its long and close ties with the Haqqani network, which is alleged to have kept the Canadian-American couple hostage for more than five years. One explanation for their “rescue” soon after the return from U.S of Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Khwaja Asif was the ultimate he received in Washington, following up on the blunt warning issued by the President and his senior advisors that the time had come for punitive action against Islamabad.

A panicked Pakistani establishment appears to have decided not to push its luck while engineering the “rescue” of the hostages, including three infant and toddler children, much to the delight of a Trump administration that has had little success to boast of. Trump then publicly thanked tweeting: “Starting to develop a much better relationship with Pakistan and its leaders. I want to thank them for their cooperation on many fronts.”

The tweet sent alarms among regional experts, most of them deeply skeptical of Pakistan’s anti-terrorism credentials, with questions of how little it would take for the U.S President to over-turn a new Afghan policy that has been arrived at after much deliberation.

But in the week since the rescue, Pakistan has been battered by Drone strikes, even as its foreign minister Khwaja Asif has maintained that the strikes are in indeterminate territory since the borders with Afghanistan are poorly demarcated in the Kurram region.

These are the first drone strikes by the Trump administration after such attacks by unmanned aircraft reached a peak in 2010 (122 strikes) under the Obama administration and gradually petered out with 70 (in 2011), 48 (2012), 26 (2013), 22 (2014), 10 (2015) and 3 (2016).

The sudden resumption this past week with six strikes comes after both President Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned Pakistan that it is best to end its support for terrorist groups in its own interest. Tillerson is scheduled to drop by in Islamabad later this month before visiting New Delhi.

Highlights Pakistan Army had said in a statement that the hostages ""were captured by terrorists from Afghanistan during 2012 and kept as hostages there.

Caitlan Coleman, an American citizen, and her husband Joshua Boyle, a Canadian citizen, were kidnapped in 2012 in Afghanistan while on a backpacking trip.

Caitlan Coleman with her Canadian husband Joshua Boyle

WASHINGTON: CIA chief Mike Pompeo has said a US-Canadian couple kidnapped by terrorists in Afghanistan had been held for five years inside Pakistan before being freed, contradicting the Pakistan Army's claim that the hostages were rescued shortly after entering the country from Afghanistan.

""The couple had been held for five years inside Pakistan,"" Pompeo yesterday said during a wide-ranging discussion at the Foundation for Defence of Democracies, a Washington-based thinktank.

His remarks contradicts the Pakistan Army which had said in a statement that the hostages ""were captured by terrorists from Afghanistan during 2012 and kept as hostages there.""

Caitlan Coleman, an American citizen, and her husband Joshua Boyle , a Canadian citizen, were kidnapped in 2012 in Afghanistan while on a backpacking trip.

Coleman, 31, was pregnant at the time of abduction. All of the couple's three children were born in captivity.

The Pakistan Army statement issued on October 12 did not identify the group which had held the family captive, but the US leadership have blamed Haqqani Network as the perpetrators.

After the recovery of hostages, the Pakistan military officials emphasised the importance of co-operation and intelligence sharing by Washington.

""The success underscores the importance of timely intelligence sharing and Pakistan's continued commitment towards fighting this menace through cooperation between two forces against a common enemy,"" the Army statement said.

The operation came at a time when Pakistan is trying to rebuild bilateral ties frayed after President Donald Trump accused the country of sheltering terror groups.

Trump, in August, had accused Pakistan of harbouring ""agents of chaos and terror"" and the ""very enemy US forces have fighting in Afghanistan"" for the past 17 years.

Last week, Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif had said his country was ready for a joint operation with the US to destroy the Haqqani Network if it provides evidence about the presence of safe havens of the dreaded terror outfit in Pakistan.

The Haqqani network has carried out a number of kidnappings and attacks against US interests in Afghanistan. The group is also blamed for several deadly attacks against Indian interests in Afghanistan, including the 2008 bombing of the Indian mission in Kabul that killed 58 people.

US officials believe Pakistan's spy agency ISI maintains close ties with the Haqqani Network and provides safe havens to its top leadership.

""I think history would indicate that the high expectations for the Pakistanis' willingness to help us in the fight against radical Islamic terrorism should be set at a very low level,"" the CIA chief said.

President Trump has ""made it very clear that we are going to do everything we can to bring the Taliban to the negotiation table. To do that, you cannot have a safe haven in Pakistan. The intelligence is very clear,"" he warned.

Pompeo said ""to achieve the objective that the president has set forth in Afghanistan, the capacity of terrorists to cross along the Afghan border and freely hide in Pakistan is prohibited in our capacity to deliver that and so mission is to ensure that safe haven does not exist"".

A husband-wife's day long scuffle took violent proportions when the man held a knife to his daughter's throat as a threatening gesture .The girls, who sustained minor injuries , were immediately rushed to the hospital. Their mother took the matter in her own hands and filed a complaint against her husband at the MIDC Bhosari police station on Friday.On February 17, Vijay Vayal (33) and his wife, Sheetal (28) entered into a spat, which the neighbours informed were occurring quite regularly and over different issues. On Friday afternoon, the couple's argument left a bitter Vijay writhing in anger for the entire day.Around 8.30 pm, he threatened to slit his daughters' throats before Sheetal, in a bid to tell her that “she cannot have her way in a dispute“.The yelling continued for a while, where he reportedly asked her to mend her ways.Sheetal and Vijay have been married for seven years now. What seemed to be a blissful marriage initially, turned sour over half a decade. The couple, who resides in Indrayni Nagar, Bhosari, owns a laundromat business.Their first daughter, Sharvari, was born a year after a marriage. Five years later, Sheetal gave birth to their second daughter, Sai.Over the span of time, the neighbours said that the marriage was falling apart. When the cops questioned them, they were told that Sheetal and Vijay would end up having a big quarrel every month over impending money issues or differences over minor things.However, they added that the attempt to injure the girls had occurred for the first time. The Vayal family claimed that Vijay loved his daughters.The cops reached the spot as soon as the complaint was registered. “We arrested Vijay from his home. Currently, he seems to be in a state of shock for holding a knife against his daughters' throat. He will be in the police custody for next four days,“ said Hemant Kokni, police sub-inspector of MIDC Bhosari.He added that Vijay's family has told the Bhosari police (and the act itself is proof enough, feel cops), that there is a possibility that he did this in a fit of rage. “We have been told that he has had temperamental issues for a while now,“ Kokani said.Vijay has been charged for attempt to murder and intent to provoke breach of the peace under sections 307 and 504 of the Indian Penal Code. Sharvari and Sai are currently recovering and will get discharged from the hospital soon."

CAIRO: An affiliate of the dreaded Islamic state miltant group in Egypt on Wednesday claimed to have beheaded a 30-year-old Croatian hostage and posted a picture of his body at the end of a 48-hour deadline.

The Croat, Tomislav Salopek, was abducted last month west of the capital Cairo.

Sinai Province, an Islamic State affiliate based in Egypt, released a photo on its Twitter account that shows the Croatian hostage beheaded and included a caption charging Croatia with participating in the war on IS.

The caption said that Tomislav Salopek, a married man and a father of two, was killed for his country's participation in the war against the Islamic State.

The incident comes a week after the IS demanded the Egyptian government to free female Muslim prisoners in exchange for the Croatian hostage.

On August 5, Sinai Province, which was previously known as Ansar Beit el-Maqdes militant group, had released a video of Tomislav in which he indicated that he worked for the Cairo branch of a French company, and was kidnapped on July 22, 2015.

In the video, he said that the group wants to substitute him for the Muslim women arrested in Egyptian prisons.

He also added that this has to be achieved before 48 hours from the time of the video or he will be killed.

BHUBANESWAR: While the Prime Minister Narendra Modi has started a massive campaign to promote cashless transaction in the country post demonetisation move, a group of villagers in the state’s backward Kalahandi district on Saturday held the sarpanch as hostage asking for kerosene in lieu of paddy.

The villagers of Kasibahal freed their sarpanch Balabhadra Patel after a five hour high-voltage drama. The block development officer (BDO) Raghunath Mundary intervened and promised that he would facilitate sale of their paddy and get them cash to buy kerosene. The villagers get kerosene on subsidized rate under National Food Security Act (NFSA) from the panchayat every month.

According to reports, the villagers rushed to the panchayat with the paddy they had earned by working in the agricultural field of big landlords. The landlords usually pay in the shape of paddy and cash also. But this time because of cash crunch , they were paid only the paddy for the labour they lent.

Kasibahal is one of the largest panchayats having 98 per cent people dependent on farming. The panchayat comes under Koksara block, where there are three ATMs including the one of SBI. The Kasibahal village is about 20 km from the block headquarters, where there is one ATM.

""Since the big landlords for whom the marginal farmers work don’t have enough cash as the ATMs are not able to meet the requirement. Otherwise, the villagers would have some cash at least for buying essential item like kerosene,"" Mundary told TOI.

He said the panchayat doesn’t provide kerosene in lieu of paddy. “We have never given kerosene by taking anything in kind. This is against the rule,"" said the BDO adding he has discussed with Primary Agricultural Credit Society (Pacs), which buys paddy from the farmers on minimum support price (MSP) fixed by the government. But, the villagers, who held the sarpanch hostage , are not registered as to sell their paddy in Pacs’ mandi.

Addressing a meeting of MPs from several opposition parties on the eve of the presidential poll , Sonia said the election represented “a conflict of disparate values” and the battle should be fought hard.Admitting that the ruling BJP-led alliance had an edge in the presidential and vice-presidential poll, Sonia appealed for a conscience vote. “In these contests, the numbers may be against us. But the battle must be fought and fought hard. We cannot and must not let India be hostage to those who wish to impose upon it a narrow-minded, divisive and communal vision,” she said.“This election represents a clash of ideas, a conflict of disparate values. The election demands a vote of conscience to preserve the India that the Mahatma and that illustrious generation of freedom fighters, joined by thousands upon thousands of ordinary men and women, fought for,” she added. The opposition’s presidential candidate Meira Kumar and vice-presidential candidate Gopalkrishna Gandhi were present at the meeting.JD(U), which supports the NDA candidate for the presidential poll, was not present. The vice-presidential poll will be on August 5. Both elections take place through secret ballot and electors are not bound by any whip.“Our meeting marks not only our coming together to protect and preserve our pluralistic democracy, but also our shared vision for our nation.What is at stake is our future, and the values we cherish and must uphold especially at this time of grave disquiet.” Stressing that parliamentarians must have confidence in the values they believe in, she said, “We must stand more aware than ever of who we are, what we fought for in our Independence struggle and what future we want for ourselves.“The presence of so many of you from so many different parties to support our distinguished candidates confirms that the fight for an inclusive, tolerant and pluralistic India is being truly waged. It is a fight we will never give up.”In Video: Prez poll a fight against narrow-minded communal vision: Sonia Gandhi"

LUDHIANA: In a broad daylight robbery, two armed assailants struck at the house of an ex-serviceman and decamped with cash and gold worth lakhs of rupees after holding his wife hostage at gunpoint in Hazuri Bagh Colony of Bhatiyan on Friday afternoon.

Gurdev Kaur, wife of Dharam Singh , a retired hawaldar from the army, told police that her husband and son had gone to the market when she heard the doorbell ring at around 1pm. When she opened the door, she found two persons who introduced themselves as cops from Ladowal police station.

The complainant said since there was a case against her husband at Ladowal police station, she allowed them inside. They asked for a glass of water, and while she was going towards the kitchen, the duo pounced on her and threw a rope around her neck, due to which she fell down.

One of them pointed a pistol at her head and asked her to sit down with her face towards the wall. He also held a big knife in another hand and brushed it against her neck. His accomplice in the meantime, broke the locks of almirahs in three rooms and store and collected gold jewellery weighing around 15 tolas and worth Rs1.5 lakhs.

The complainant said one of them even asked his accomplice to kill her, but she somehow managed to save her life by giving them two gold bangles and earrings, while begging for her life. The accused then fled after locking her inside a room. Police said it was later when Bhupinder Singh — nephew of Dharam Singh came to meet her uncle for some work that he found his aunt locked in the house.

He informed his uncle, following which a complaint was lodged with the Ladowal police station. Gurdev Kaur said there was jewellery in the house as the marriage of her son Karamvir Singh Saini, who runs a garment store in the area, was scheduled after ten days, and the family was on a shopping spree.

SHO Ravinderpal Singh said cops had got CCTV footage of the area, and were scanning it. He added that the assailants seem to have come on two bikes. They could have been followed by a vehicle, as they were suspected to have escaped in it after committing the crime. Police said the miscreants also took away the recording of CCTV installed in the house.

An Indian Catholic priest missing since a suspected Islamic State (IS) attack last Friday on a care home in Aden, Yemen, is reportedly being held captive by the assailants. An Indian nun was among 16 people killed in the strike on the Missionaries of Charityrun establishment, while another is reportedly missing.

External affairs minister Sushma Swaraj announced on Saturday that Father Tom Uzhunnalil, a native of Kottayam who lived at the home, had been abducted. He had arrived there from an unsafe place in Yemen for refuge.

“Our camp office in (Yemen’s neighbour) Djibouti is trying to ascertain the whereabouts of Father Tom Uzhunnalil so that we can secure his release,” Swaraj added in a Twitter post. India shut down its mission in Yemen after evacuating most of its citizens last year.

According to local reports, the 56-year-old priest was handcuffed before being driven away to an undisclosed destination. Kerala CM Oommen Chandy said there were no clues about Uzhunnalil’s whereabouts. “She (Swaraj) expressed doubts about the efficacy of the government there, but has assured that the Centre will do its best,” he added. Chandy was also quoted as saying that Swaraj had mentioned an Indian nurse being missing since the attack.

Yemeni authorities have blamed IS for the attack. “We are aware that no group has claimed the attack... but information points to... Daesh (an Arabic acronym for IS),” said a security official.

THRISSUR: A group of people belonging to the SC/ST colony at Thamaravellachal near Peechi held eight forest officials including the DFO hostage for about four hours on Tuesday. The officials claimed they had gone to the colony as part of the investigation on the theft of wood from the forest areas. However, the agitating tribals and dalits alleged that the police officials were harassing them in the name of the theft of wood, though three of their colony members were arrested in the case.

The colony members including women and children first blocked the vehicle of the forest officials in the mroning, and encircled the officials when they stepped out the of the vehicle. The forest officials said the colony members did not cause any hurt to them. The agitating group released the forest officials i n the afternoon after the police officials from Peechi station held talks with their leaders and the forest officials.

According the DFO George Mathew, the forest officials had received complaints saying that some trees in the compounds of the residents in the colony, forming part of the forest areas were cut and removed. He said it was not clear how many trees were cut, but the visit was to collect such details.

However the Vasu , leader of the agitating tribals and dalits clarified that they were not opposed to any investigations and booking of the accused involved in the wood theft. ""We want those culpable must be punished. In fact we ourselves had spotted three people in our colony and the police had arrested them. We had cooperated with the forest officials when they came to the colony on seven occasions earlier for investigation. Now they are coming repeatedly to harass us, and want to lay the blame on us for all the illegal activities happening here’’ he said.

``Everyone knows that transporting of wood from the forest areas cannot happen without the connivance of the forest officials. So we have told them further raids can be conducted by the forest officials only if the police are accompanying them,’’ Vasu said. The DFO denied the charges that the forest officials are harassing the residents in the colonies. ``We are just searching in their compounds to locate whether any evidences like remains of wood trunks are there in the compounds. We are not even entering their houses,’’ he said. The DFO said the forest officials would go to the colonies along with the police.

KOLKATA: Three employees of an NGO were held captive at a local club in Tollygunge till late into Friday by family members of an 18-year-old boy who had gone with the NGO to attend a training programme at Delhi but had died after he had allegedly opened the door of an air conditioned compartment of Rajdhani Express and fell off the train .

The death took place on Tuesday morning, while the train was travelling Past Etawah in Uttar Pradesh around 7.30am. According to a senior official of the NGO - Kolkata Hope Foundation - Roshan Kumar Singh, had complained of feeling suffocated and opened the door to have some fresh air, when he lost balance and fell on the tracks. Roshan was a first year student of South City College who had got 91 percent marks in Higher Secondary this year.

The NGO official informed his family over phone about his death and after post mortem examination was done, his body was brought back to Kolkata in a coffin and handed over to his parents on Wednesday. His funeral was completed the same night. On Friday, the NGO officials had gone there to get some signature on documents that the Government Railway Police at Uttar Pradesh had asked the NGO to get done by the boy's parents when they held them captive.

Police had tried to rescue them and although they succeeded in rescuing a woman, two others -- a middle aged woman and a man in his late 30 were still held captive inside a local club as local residents of Chandra Mondal Lane in Mudiali agitated before the police demanding a thorough explanation of how the boy died and demanded arrest of the NGO director.

""An accident case has been initiated by the GRP at Uttar Pradesh. Our employees were not at fault. The boy had fell down by himself. It is a tragic incident to which several other train passengers are witness to,"" said Geeta Venkadakrishnan, the NGO director.

The boy's mother, Devanti Devi Singh however refused to believe it was just an accident. ""The NGO authorities never took our permission before taking my son to Delhi. They did not explain how he died and left his dead body in a coffin outside our house and had left. I think my son was either killed or he died because of their negligence. A thorough investigation in this case should be done,"" she said.

The NGO, Kolkata Hope Foundation runs a free coaching institute for slum dwellers at the Tollygunge Police Station under the project Nabadisha. According to the NGO authorities, Roshan used to take coaching here from a very early age and was one of the brighter students. ""So he was selected for the training. In fact this was the third time he was going to Delhi for a similar training programme in the last four years,"" said the official. The official added Roshan had boarded the train to Delhi on Monday with another student and two of the NGO officials.

On Friday night, the family lodged a complaint with Tollygunge police station.

BENGALURU: A private bus was waylaid and its 42 passengers held hostage for three hours by seven men at a private parking lot in Rajarajeshwarinagar on Friday night just to recover a loan from a travel company. While four of the accused have been detained, three are on the run.

Around 10pm on Friday, the bus, owned by Bengaluru-based Lama Travels , left Kalasipalya for Kannur in Kerala. Within minutes of its departure, the bus was waylaid by two bike-borne men posing as cops. The men asked the driver to deboard as they wanted to search the bus. One of them took to the wheel while the driver was forced to ride pillion with the biker.

The clueless passengers, including 10 women, were driven to a private parking lot in Pattanagere. Five other men joined the duo which had waylaid the bus and locked the vehicle. For the next three hours, the passengers were held hostage until police came to their rescue and apprehended four of the seven men.

Police said the miscreants were from Fullerton India Credit Company Limited , which had lent money to Lama Travels. They devised such a plan in a bid to recover the loan from the travel company.

“We identified the travel company owner as Rafiq. He has been asked to appear before us and give a statement. The persons detained were not directly involved in waylaying of the bus. We’re looking for three more men, including the two who stopped the bus,” he said.

“As soon as they saw policemen, the men and their associates fled. We were relieved when cops took control of the situation,” the bus passengers said.

GURUGRAM: More than a week after two men kidnapped an insurance executive at gunpoint on Sohna Road and robbed him of Rs 1,95,000, the accused were arrested in Iffco Chowk on Friday night.

The 32-year-old employee of AIG Insurance, Samarth Kohli, was rescued by police on May 23 from Pali in Rajasthan, a day after the abduction, as cops tracked the location of the ATMs where robbers forced Samarth to withdraw money. The accused were produced in a city court on Saturday and have been sent on a three-day police remand.

Identified as Rahul Yadav and Jitender Joshi, the two men have also been involved in cricket betting and gambling over the last few months, said police. While Jitender is a school dropout, Rahul pursued BEd after finishing his graduation; however, both of them are unemployed.

On May 22, Samarth was held hostage by the accused when he stopped his Honda City on Sohna Road around 10pm. Police said the robber-duo had lost a lot of money in gambling, and they were planning a heist to pay off the debts. The duo got into an argument with Samarth on the pretext of getting injured by the old car lights that Samarth dumped after halting the car. He was then thrashed, kidnapped at gunpoint and forced to withdraw money from his different ATM cards during the 15-hour ordeal.

“They not only thrashed him but continued to use his ATM cards for withdrawal of cash,” said Deepak Saharan, DCP (east) told TOI.

After Samarth was kidnapped, his brother, Dhruv, informed the police about the SMSes of ATM transactions on the mobile that he had left back at home.

While several transactions were carried out in Gurgaon from ATMs in Sector 14 and Sector 49, an SMS gave details about payment of Rs 2,360 made at a petrol pump in Rewari. Police confirmed that Samarth had been kidnapped by recovering CCTV footage from the petrol pump. Samarth was rescued 15 hours later from Pali in Rajasthan, about 500km from Gurgaon, where the accused left him and fled.

The case, registered at Sadar police station under section 365 (kidnap) of the IPC, was handed over to crime unit, Palam Vihar. On Friday night, the crime unit team headed by inspector Sajjan Singh Dalal finally nabbed the duo after receiving a tip-off.

Police said most of the amount has been recovered; however, the weapon which was used to threaten and kidnap Samarth has not been found yet.

NOIDA: Three unidentified men escaped with an SUV after taking its driver hostage at gunpoint in Greater Noida on Thursday night. The victim, Arun Kumar , works for a security services agency in Sonia Vihar in Delhi.

“Our agency had provided security services for an event in Mihir Bhoj Park in Greater Noida. I came inside the venue to meet some officials while the driver stayed with the car outside. When I returned an hour later, the driver and the vehicle were not there,” said Ram Babu, owner of the agency. A few passers-by told him that three men had forced the driver on to the back seat and fled with the car.

The driver, Arun Kumar, reached a police chowki on Friday morning and told policemen that three men had abducted him at gunpoint and dumped him at a deserted location. “I had parked the vehicle on roadside and ordered some food from a stall. The men reached there and pointed a country-made gun at me. One of them quickly pushed me inside the car and another one took to the driver’s seat,” he said.

The victim said that the criminals tied a handkerchief on his face and drove off. They had also tied his hands and legs with a piece of cloth and threatened to shoot him if he raised an alarm.

Some passersby approached him hearing his cries when he was dumped by the criminals near Dadri. The passers-by helped him in untying his hands and feet. Kumar later reached NTPC police chowki and registered a complaint against the criminals in the morning.

Abhishek Yadav, SP (rural), Gautam Budh Nagar, said that a case has been registered. “We have formed a team to investigate the matter. The criminals will be arrested soon,” he said.

KOLKATA: From Kidderpore to Raigunj, the campus scene looks like an action-packed crime thriller. For elite institutions like Presidency University and Jadavpur University , it is liberty unlimited. Caught between extremes, the silent majority of the students do not know what to do.

Bengal has witnessed many upheavals in educational institutions since the Naxal days. The context and issues may have changed, with the recent ones failing to establish a social connect, but the vacuum has encouraged the ruling party and the libertines to act as they wish.

Parents are getting jittery and so are sections of students. But this voice of silence is going unheard in the power game. Like realtors breaking up the city into syndicate zones, the ruling politicians are concentrating on college campuses to establish party hegemony. This belies what Mamata Banerjee had promised before coming to power.

The Mamata government decimated the erstwhile college governing bodies, senates, syndicates and executive councils -the democratic structures in education institutions - claiming they had become wings of the Left Front to exercise control. What it did instead was pack the units with their own men and plugged the scope of representation of university stake holders. The government also made amends to the process to select the vice-chancellor by dropping the UGC nominee from the selection panel. The result is clear. Vice-chancellors and principals now love to be seen on the dais with the chief ministers. The VC has become all-powerful and there is little space for dialogue. Such a system has bred misgivings, mistrust and lack of patience among students, often with ugly manifestations.

This atmosphere is impeding education reforms that Bengal needs. A case in point is former education minister Bratya Basu's failed effort to introduce a centralized online admission system. The local satraps didn't like this transparency because it could end the admission syndicates in many colleges. The corruption is inherent to a party command system where loyalty gets precedence over merit. It has roots in the Left Front regime. Young Trinamool leaders took this further and monetized it.

Those who got admission on their own either withdrew themselves from the social sphere, or joined the chorus to buy peace.Few enjoying the immunity of elite institutions raised their voice, often to prove they were different from the rest. They started abusing the system and disrespecting individuals as if that was enough to show their dissent. In the process, they misused democracy, defamed institutions and in a way are helping those who want to run education institutions like sweatshops."

GURUGRAM: A 32-year-old insurance executive from Delhi was kidnapped by two armed men in Gurugram on Monday night and held hostage in his car overnight as he was driven from one ATM to another to withdraw as much cash as possible before being rescued by police from Rajgarh in Rajasthan , nearly 200km away, on Tuesday afternoon.

Samarth Kohli’s 15-hour ordeal began at Subhash Chowk late on Monday when he was driving home to Tilak Nagar in Delhi. Kohli, an employee of AIG Insurance whose office is in Sector 48, had stopped around 10pm near Subhash Chowk to throw out old car headlights, which he had recently got replaced, from the boot of his silver-coloured Honda City, when two men with guns appeared and held him hostage. They forced him to lie down between the front and back rows of his car, and drove off, Kohli told police.

The abductors stopped at various locations, forced Kohli to provide pin numbers of his three ATM cards, and made several withdrawals from his accounts. Luckily, the withdrawal SMS alerts were being sent to a number being used by Kohli’s sister-in-law, which the kidnappers were unaware of.

On Monday morning, Samarth’s brother Dhruv filed a complaint at Sadar police station, about his brother not returning home, while multiple withdrawals were being made from his account, including a credit card payment at a petrol pump in Sector 14. Dhruv also said there were three withdrawals of Rs 10,000 each, and one of Rs 5,000 from an ATM in Universal Tower. One more withdrawal was made at Jaipur, raising suspicion Kohli had been abducted.

A case was registered under Section 365 (kidnapping) of IPC. Police soon confirmed the abduction by checking CCTV footage from the petrol pump. A police team was immediately dispatched to Rajasthan. “We narrowed down their route with the help of locations of ATMs they withdrew from, which indicated they were moving along the Jaipur-Ajmer highway. We immediately got in touch with the Jaipur IG and the Ajmer SP, and had barricades set up along the route,” said ACP (Sadar) Anil Yadav, who headed the rescue operation.

At around 8am, the kidnappers got Kohli to call his family to inform them he was safe. By this time, they had withdrawn around Rs 1.5 lakh from Kohli’s account. The kidnappers went past a few barricades near Beawar on the highway, but were finally signalled to stop near Rajgarh in Rajasthan around 1pm. The kidnappers drove through the barricade, stopped meters ahead and ran away on foot, leaving Kohli and the car.

“We have some strong leads on the kidnappers, who have been identified. One of them is from Rajasthan, the other from Haryana,” added Yadav..

HARIDWAR: Swami Ramanand Puri, a prominent seer from Haridwar who went missing a couple of months ago and resurfaced some days ago, has alleged that he was “kidnapped and held hostage by his own people.”

Alleging that there is a threat to his life, the seer met senior police officials in Dehradun on Sunday and requested that security be provided to him since he feared for his life. Puri was head of the Mansa DeviTemple Trust which administers the famous Mansa Devi temple in Haridwar. However, sometime back, another seer Ravindra Puri , a mahant of the Niranjani akhara took over the chairmanship of the trust as well as the control of Ramanand Institute of Management and Pharmacy which had been set up by RamanandPuri.

In a press conference in Dehradun, Ramanand alleged that Ravindra Puri had kept him as a hostage and forcibly occupied the posts to gain control of the properties of the trust and the institute. “The total worth of the properties of the institute and the temple trust is around Rs100 crore, for which the conspiracy against me has been hatched,” he alleged.

Providing details of his ‘captivity’, the seer alleged that he was kept confined in his ashram by RavindraPuri from September last year onwards. “In November, I was shifted to an ashram in Allahabad and my mobile phones were taken away and I was not allowed to interact with anyone,” he said. He added that “in March this year, one of my disciples, Surendra Kumar (who is the MLA of Manda in Allahabad) somehow managed to take me out of the ashram and bring me to Delhi.” “It was in Delhi that I learnt I had been removed from the posts I held at the ashram, trust and institute on the basis of my forged letters of resignation.”

After Ramanand Puri’s allegations, a few other ascetics came out in his support. “Ravindra Puri has not acted alone in hatching the conspiracy against Ramanand. He has acted in connivance with the Akhil BharatiyaAkhara Parishad in this matter,” said Brahmarishi Kush Muni, an ascetic from Allahabad.

TOI made several attempts to reach Ravindra Puri for his comments but he remained unavailable."

LONDON: Islamic State terrorists have released a horrific new video that shows five boys, including one said to be from the UK, aged between 10 to 13 years shooting prisoners in Syria.

The boys are seen shooting dead five men identified as captured Kurdish fighters who are kneeling.

A caption claims the white boy in the video is Abu Abdullah al-Britani, who is allegedly British.

All the boys are pictured in full military fatigues and a black hat alongside the four other boys.

Five hostages are shown dressed in familiar orange jumpsuits seen in previous ISIS propaganda videos, 'The Times' reports.

""No one can save the Kurds even with the support of America, France, Britain, Germany, the devils in hell,"" the British boy is heard to say in Arabic.

He then calls for the 'takbir' -- the term referring to the phrase 'Allahu akbar' -- which the other boys shout in unison, raising their pistols to the sky before shooting the hostages dead.

The video then pans to gunshot wounds to the men's heads as they lie dead in the sand.

The four other boys in the footage are captioned as being Tunisian, Kurdish, Egyptian and Uzbekistani in origin.

There is no confirmation of the identity of the British boy from the UK Foreign Office but it is believed he could be the son of a white-British woman convert and was taken to join ISIS at the age of 10.

The name Abu Abdullah al-Britani may refer to his adopted father - a young British terrorist who married in Syria and was killed in a drone strike.

Children have featured prominently in ISIS propaganda in which the militant group boasts about preparing the next generation of fighters.

Greater Noida: Three officials of Noida Power Company Limited ( NPCL ) were allegedly held hostage for over four hours by villagers of Luksar village in Echotech 1, Greater Noida, on Thursday.

NPCL officials had on Thursday morning held a camp for the collection of dues in the village as part of an ongoing drive.

While the villagers claimed the charges levied on them were arbitrary, the NPCL officials claimed that some villagers were indulging in power theft . The villagers have threatened to stage a sit-in outside the NPCL office in Greater Noida in the coming days if their grivances were not heard.

Sandeep Kumar, a resident, said he had shut down the meter at his residence before moving out of town on July 29, 2016, and even handed over the meter to NPCL, and yet the family has been billed the fixed charge of Rs 288 and user charge of Rs 1,307 every month since then.

“We don’t understand how we are being charged when there is no meter in our house,” Kumar said.

Similarly, another resident., Rajpal Singh, had shut down and surrendered his meter 10 years ago when he sold his house and shifted to another place. He is still being billed a pending amount of Rs 4,000.

Agitated over the lack of a response from NPCL, some residents of the village held the three NPCL officials hostage from 10am to 2.30pm. According to the villagers, the village is only getting about six hours of power supply at night. However, Sarnath Ganguly, general manager (Operations), NPCL, told TOI that when Rajesh Mishra, NPCL assistant manager, went to Luksar village with two junior staff members to hold a camp for dues collection many cases of power theft came to light.

“Four-five residents lost their cool in the heat of the moment and detained the officials. As a result, the dues collection camp’s mission failed,” Ganguly said, adding that it was not true that power was supplied to the village only for six hours. “We are supplying power for 14 hours to the village and neighbouring areas,” Ganguly said.

SONARPUR: An upper-middle-class locality in the southern fringes of the city has been inundated for over a fortnight, forcing many to move in with relatives elsewhere. Those who remain, live in perpetual fear as the water level continues to inch up with every bout of heavy shower.

Mission Palli, located around 3km from Kamalgazi off the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and not far from Sonarpur rail station, has beautiful bungalows and smart low-rise apartment blocks. Its proximity to the city and an abundance of greenery attracted many to set up residence here. But come monsoon, the dream locality turns nightmarish. The first heavy shower drowns the area and maroons residents for days.

The situation has worsened this year, with Mission Palli being under water since July 9-10. It has been nearly three weeks but the water seems far from receding.

Prawn exporter Suhas Sarkar, who spent a fortune on a palatial bungalow here, has not been able to step out ever since nightlong rain flooded the locality. As the meteorological office issues another warning of heavy rainfall in south Bengal, Sarkar is contemplating whether to stick on or move out.

“I built this house with a lot of passion. It was adjudged the best bungalow in Bengal by Lafarge Cements. But now, I wish I hadn’t invested so much emotion in it. Every time it rains, I peep out of the window, tracking the rise in water level. We can’t breathe fresh air as the windows have to be kept shut to keep the stench of putrefying stagnant water out. I can’t go to my office in Hastings and LIC agents are refusing to collect policy premiums from my residence. The neighbourhood shops are all shut and provision is slowly getting exhausted. I have become a hostage in my own home,” said Sarkar.

What is usually a lively locality has sunk into despair. Even in homes that are still occupied, there is no sign of life. With nothing to look at but the sea of still water, residents stay indoors. Only those who have no other option venture out, wading through waist to knee-deep water.

Sayantani Gupta, a first year student at Andrews College in Garia, has to wade through the filthy water and then travel an hour to reach college. The first thing she does there is wash her legs vigorously to avoid scabs. “There’s a constant itch till I have a thorough wash. The thought of having to wade through the water again at the end of the day gives me shivers,” she said.

Parents of students at Teghoria Primary School spend the afternoons casting anxious glances at the overcast skies. As Srabanti (Class IV) waded through the water with her friend Baisakhi (Class V), her mother prayed for their safe return. If it rains for three-four hours, they will get stranded.

Dental surgeon Debasis Maitra hasn’t been able to open his chamber since July 10. With water shutting out the area from the rest of the world, he has no hopes of getting a patient till the water recedes. “I am marooned and helpless. Barring a couple of emergency patients, there’s nothing to do but wait hopelessly,” he said.

Hopeless it really is with the municipality and state irrigation department offering no solution to the crisis. About 70% of the 35 wards of Sonarpur-Rajpur Municipality is inundated and some residents were moved into schools in Kamrabad and Chanditala.

Municipality chairman Pallab Kumar Das said he tried to find a way out but has failed. “We are trying to pump out water but to no avail. Till it continues to rain, it will not make any difference as there is no drainage line linking the affected localities with Begumpur canal,” he said.

Sonarpur MLA Firdousi Begum echoed him, saying, “Three pumps have been installed to drain out the water. But unless the rain stops, the situation is unlikely to change.”

Irrigation minister Rajib Banerjee, who toured the inundated localities, including Mission Palli, admitted the situation was critical but had no solution to offer. “Sections of the canal are encroached upon. People have set up homes and shops there. These need to be cleared immediately,” he said.

Former state election commissioner Mira Pandey, who lives in Ramkrishna Palli, next to Mission Palli, is bearing the situation with fortitude. But each time she drives through the perpetually waterlogged streets, she wonders how long it is going to be.

“I can’t deny the sinking feeling when I return home. People are living in hell,” she said.

ISLAMABAD: The Afghan Taliban released the six-member crew, including a Russian, of Pakistan's Mi-17 transport helicopter on Saturday. The chopper was heading to Russia for repair via Uzbekistan when it made an emergency landing in Taliban-controlled Logar province due to technical problems on August 4.

Both the Pakistan and Russian governments had been making efforts for the release of the hostages. The crew ""was released in an inter-tribe exchange on the Pakistan-Afghan border (and) arrived in Islamabad today"", foreign ministry spokesman Nafees Zakaria said. Some security analysts believe the exchange could be a result of the influence of ISI on the terrorists.

Thrissur: A group of people belonging to the SC/ST colony at Thamaravellachal near Peechi held eight forest officials, including the DFO , hostage for about four hours on Tuesday.

The officials claimed they had gone to the colony as part of the investigation on the theft of wood from forest areas.

However, the agitating tribesmen and dalits alleged that the officials were harassing them in the name of theft of wood, though three of their colony members have been arrested in the case.

The agitators released the officials by afternoon after the police officials from Peechi station held talks with their leaders.

According the DFO George Mathew, the forest officials had received complaints saying that some trees in the compounds of the residents in the colony, which come under forest area, were cut down.

However Vasu, leader of the agitating tribesmen and dalits clarified that they were not opposed to any investigation and action against accused involved in the wood theft.

""We want those responsible for cutting trees to be punished. Everyone knows that transporting of wood from the forest area cannot happen without the connivance of the forest officials. So we have told them further raids can be conducted by the forest officials only if the police accompany them,'' he said. The DFO denied the charges that the officials harassed the residents .

ISLAMABAD/NEW DELHI: Pakistan on Sunday rejected reports that an Indian woman married to a Pakistani man was being held hostage at the Indian High Commission building in Islamabad .

Tahir Ali, a resident of Buner town in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in the northwest, had lodged a complaint at Islamabad’s Secretariat police station to help him recover his Indian national wife, Uzma, who had gone into the Indian embassy but did not return.

Local media, however, said that foreign office spokesperson Nafees Zakaria had rubbished reports that the woman was being held hostage inside the Indian High Commission building.

Ali had met Uzma in Malaysia eight months ago where he was working as a taxi driver. Police said Uzma came to Pakistan on May 1 via Wagah border and the two contracted a court marriage two days later in Buner.

Later, Uzma called her brother in New Delhi and informed him that she had tied the knot. According to Ali, her brother asked her to visit India on honeymoon and told her that to contact a person named Adnan at the Indian embassy who would sort out their visas issue for the trip.

In his complaint to the police, Ali alleged: “At the Indian embassy window she asked for Adnan. A while later, a man came out and took her inside through gate number six. I waited and waited, and then at 7pm, I asked the embassy staff at the gate if my wife was inside. They told me no one was inside.”

“I then returned to the main gate on a shuttle bus,” he said, adding that none of the three phones surrendered to the embassy by them at the time of entrance were returned to him.

When police contacted the Indian High Commission, the officials there said Uzma was in their office but refused to release her, saying that negotiations on the matter will be held through the foreign office. The foreign office said it was in contact with the Indian High Commission and the issue would be resolved soon.

An Indian government source said the woman had sought help from the Indian mission on May 5. “The high commission is providing necessary consular assistance to the woman and is in touch with the Pakistan foreign office and her family in India,” he said.

GURGAON: A teenage girl was lured by two of her acquaintances to Delhi, held hostage for over two days, repeatedly gang-raped and videographed during the act, before being released on Monday. An FIR was filed on Monday after the rape survivor approached police along with her parents, but no one has been arrested so far.

According to the police complaint, on Saturday afternoon, the 15-year-old girl, a student of Class X in a government school in Badshapur, was lured out of her school by her acquaintance Karan Singh, a resident of Palra village. Singh convinced her to accompany him to Delhi on a private bus plying from Sohna to Delhi, along with the other accused, Sanjay, an unemployed youth from Dhani Shikohpur village. Once they reached Kalkaji in Delhi, she was held hostage in a room where the duo raped her.

The next day, they raped her again, while two others, Mahesh and Kala, both residents of Palra, allegedly made an objectionable video to be used to blackmail her. In her complaint, the girl had initially named Mahesh as the videographer. She later changed her version while submitting the recorded statement before a magistrate under CrPC Section 164, including Kala as Mahesh's assistant in making the video.

After two days in captivity, the accused allegedly put her in a Gurgaon-bound bus on Monday morning and sent her back to her parents. She broke down and told them everything, and was taken to the police station. Based on her complaint, a medical examination was conducted, which confirmed rape. Police subsequently registered an FIR against the three, under sections 363 (abduction), 365 (abducting with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine person), 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC and Section 6 of POCSO Act.

""She was taken to Delhi by Karan Singh and his friend Sanjay on Saturday by a bus. After raping her for two days and making a video of it, the accused allegedly threatened to kill her if she disclosed anything to anyone. Karan was known to the girl, which is why she trusted him, under the impression they would return to Gurgaon in two hours,"" police said the survivor had told them.

""Based on the complaint, an FIR has been registered against three persons. A fourth has now been added for criminal conspiracy. All four are aged between 23 and 25, and are unemployed. We're probing the matter. They are at large, but we are conducting raids and hope to nab them soon,"" said Praveen Malik, SHO, Badshapur.

AGRA: Agitated anganwadi workers on Tuesday took SDM and ADM of Mainpuri hostage, locking them inside their room for almost half an hour, to protest against the administration's failure in taking action on their demand of higher remuneration.

According to Sarita Shakya, vice-president of UP Aganwadi Association, they had been agitating for their demands for the last one month but no one from the administration was paying heed to them. She said they tried to serve a memorandum on the officials on Tuesday and when they refused to accept it, they locked the SDM and the ADM in their offices.

“It was only after the administration gave us a written assurance and fixed our meeting in Lucknow that we allowed the ADM and the SDM to come out”, she said adding that they were also demanding action against a DPO who had threatened to sack a colleague, who subsequently died due to a hear attack.

She said the association’s demands include increase of their honorary payment from existing Rs 3,200 to Rs 15,000.

When contacted, district magistrate PC Gupta denied that the ADM and SDM were kept hostage. “They just locked their back room for a short while”, he said adding that a meeting of the angawadi workers has been fixed with the department’s director and secretary for resolving their demands.

Pune: The three students kidnapped and later released by Maoists in Chhattisgarh last week returned to Pune on Wednesday afternoon.

The trio was questioned by top police officials before letting them go home. Two of them hail from Karad in Satara district while the third one is from Wagholi in the city.

""The youths narrated their experiences in captivity. We did not find anything suspicious in their version of the kidnapping,"" said joint police commissioner Sunil Ramanand.

Deputy commissioner of police (special branch) Shrikant Pathak questioned the students who were escorted by a policeman from Gadchiroli.

The three students - Shrikrishna Shewale, Adarsh Patil and Vikas Walke - had decided to visit the remote areas of Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Telangana as part of their 'Bharat Jodo' campaign. They left Pune on bicycles on December 22, 2015. They were kidnapped while crossing Chintalnar and Sukhma villages, which are Maoist strongholds. The four of them were held captive for four days and released unconditionally on Sunday.

Pathak said the Maoists forced them to sleep in open fields and eat whatever the villagers offered them. ""The students were released unhurt because they followed all the instructions,"" Pathak said.

The three students were first spotted by villagers. ""The villagers did not understand Hindi, English or Marathi while the youths did not know didn't know the tribal language. The villagers took them along. The next day, a man in green uniform, questioned them, but the language barrier remained,"" Pathak added.

The students were then taken to another village where they were kept for two more days. ""Another man in uniform, who looked like their boss, questioned them with the help of an interpreter. This cleared the confusion and they were finally released,"" Pathak added.

Adarsh and Shrikrishna have left for Karad, their native village in Satara district, while Vikas went to his house in Perne Phata near Wagholi.

Vikas's sister Madhumati said a team of Chhattisgarh and Gadchiroli police brought the three boys to Pune in a special vehicle. ""My brother and his friends are okay,"" she said.

LUCKNOW: A cancer patient held hostage by a private hospital on Kursi Road was rescued by a health team on Friday evening. The authorities also found that the private hospital was running without any documents and extending services in general surgery and gynaecology besides cancer care.

The relative of another patient anonymously complained to chief medical officer Dr GS Bajpai that the hospital authorities had held a patient hostage as the latter was not able to pay treatment bills.

“We got the complaint late evening and acted immediately,“ said Dr Bajpai.

“We found seven patients admitted but no doctor present. Even nurses and paramedics ran away in a jiffy on seeing us,“ the CMO said. Initially, the team did not find any patient held hostage.Seeing a few rooms locked, the team decided to break open into them. “We were shocked to see a middle-aged woman locked in a semi-conscious state in a room. When she gained conscious, she revealed that she was suffering from cancer and her relatives had gone to arrange for money to pay bills,“ Dr Bajpai said, adding that the woman has been admitted to KGMU.

The team examined patient files and seized all documents present. “The premises have been sealed under law.An FIR has been lodged against the owner and manager,“ the CMO said.

Patients who appeared serious were shifted to KGMU, Avanti Bai hospital and RML hospital.

The team comprised Dr Rajendra Chaudhury, Dr SK Rawat, Dr PK Mishra and staff Saurabh. An additional city magistrate-rank officer and local police accompanied the team. A high court order empowers the CMO to raid any medical establishment working in an unauthorized manner.

Panaji: The disciplinary committee of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) is expected to come down hard on FC Goa after the match commissioner urged action “to save Indian football from being taken hostage by a few people”.

AK Mamukoya, who was the match commissioner for Sunday’s calamitous Indian Super League ( ISL ) final clash between FC Goa and Chennaiyin FC at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda, has submitted an explosive two-page report to the AIFF that possibly seals all escape routes for the Goan franchise.

“The image of Indian football has been jeopardized as a whole due to irresponsible and illogical behaviour of some officials of FC Goa that brought disrepute to the game of football in India,” the match commissioner wrote in his report to the AIFF.

FC Goa’s boycott of the prize distribution ceremony, the fracas that ensued after the match between FC Goa president Dattaraj Salgaocar and Chennaiyin FC captain Elano Blumer, besides the ill-treatment of match officials has all been covered in detail.

The match commissioner, though, appeared most perturbed that Japanese referee Yudai Yamamoto and his two assistants were abused in filthy language and threatened with physical assault.

“It may not be out of place to mention that referees from other countries may not like to travel to India for any of the matches held under AIFF in future, as message of ill treatment would be known to the world,” said Mamukoya.

The match commissioner said FC Goa co-owners Shrinivas Dempo and Dattaraj Salgaocar— who he knows for long due to their association with football — “should have calmed down the situation (but) instead became part of the undesirable atmosphere.”

The confrontation between Elano and Dattaraj Salgaocar has also found mention.

“I have seen one player of Chennaiyin FC, Elano Blumer (Brazil), was surrounded by many players and officials of FC Goa who were pushing him. He somehow came out of the melee and ran to join his team. It was a chaotic scene all around,” said Mamukoya, who makes no mention of the alleged assault and abuse that led to the Brazilian midfielder being arrested by Margao police.

The match commissioner noted how referees were tensed after the final, and at around 10.30pm when they were ready to leave the stadium, he was told by a police official that “they cannot give police protection to the referees group.”

Later, armed escort was arranged to ferry the match officials to a separate hotel.

“The referees reached the other hotel traumatized,” notes Mamukoya.

“In my opinion, the behaviour of FC Goa after the final whistle was unreasonable, indisciplined, bullish and frightening to say the least. It was surely unsporting behaviour of the highest order. FC Goa should have accepted the defeat with dignity and shown respect for laws of the game.

“In the contrary, the behaviour of Chennaiyin FC was much dignified and respectful to their opponent as seen from their limited and controlled celebration after the win,” said the match commissioner.

The AIFF has forwarded the match commissioner’s report to its disciplinary committee for necessary action.

NEW DELHI: An elderly woman, her granddaughter and their maid were held hostage at knifepoint in their house in west Delhi’s Kirti Nagar on Monday afternoon by their cook and two other men and robbed of Rs 40 lakh in cash and jewellery.

The cook was hired three days ago.

The incident took place between 1pm and 3pm when the woman, Tajender Kaur (60), was at home with her 11-month-old granddaughter and a maid. Kaur’s son and his wife were away at work and her husband, Swarn Singh, had gone to his factory in Kondli.

“The cook arrived at the house around 1pm. After about 15 minutes, two other men entered the house with his help and straightaway went to the elderly woman’s room. They tied her arms with a piece of cloth and locked her in a room. The three men then locked the maid and the infant in another room,” said a senior police officer.

The robbers snatched the cellphones of the victims to stop them from calling for help.

The three men then ransacked the house and fled with cash and jewellery. Kaur somehow managed to free herself. She then unlocked the room that had the maid and the baby and untied the hands of the maid.

“Kaur called up her husband and son who informed the police. A crime and forensics team was sent to the house to collect samples. CCTV footage near the house is being checked to establish the sequence of events and identify the other robbers,” the officer said.

DCP (west) Pushpendra Kumar said that a case has been registered on the victim’s statement.

“Probe has revealed that the cook, Vinod, is a native of Gonda in Uttar Pradesh. Teams have been formed to raid his hideouts,” he said.

DHAKA/NEW DELHI: Bangladeshi police stormed a restaurant in the capital Dhaka and rescued 13 hostages on Saturday, one official said, after an attack claimed by Islamic State .Gunmen attacked the upscale cafe in the diplomatic area of Dhaka late on Friday and had been holding about 20 hostages, including foreigners, before police poured into the building to try to free those stuck inside. At least two police were killed.A police officer at the scene said that when security forces tried to enter the premises at the beginning of the siege they met a hail of bullets and grenades.Television footage showed a number of police being led away from the site with blood on their faces and clothes. Heavily armed officers were seen milling on the street outside.The number of hostages still in the restaurant was unclear, Mizanur Rahman Bhuiyan, a deputy director at the Rapid Action Battalion force, said.Bhuiyan said one foreigner, probably Japanese, was among those who escaped after more than 100 commandos launched an operation to secure the restaurant.Islamic State, which has claimed the attacks, posted photos of what it said were dead foreigners killed in the assault on the cafe, where police believe eight to nine gunmen are holed up and armed with assault rifles and grenades.Gowher Rizvi, an adviser to Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, told Reuters that security forces had tried to negotiate a way out of the crisis.Police said the gunmen attacked the Holey Artisan restaurant in the Gulshan district of Dhaka, popular with expatriates, in an assault that began around 9 p.m local time on Friday. The assailants exchanged sporadic gunfire with police outside for several hours after the attack.Islamic State said 24 people had died. Bangladesh police denied that, saying two police officers had been killed and at least 20 people wounded.Italian and Indian nationals were among the hostages, said a duty officer at Rapid Action Battalion's (RAB) control room.Italy's ambassador to Bangladesh, Mario Palma, told Italian state TV seven Italians were among the hostages. A Japanese government spokesman, quoting Dhaka police, said 12 people had been rescued but it was not known if any Japanese were among them.The hostage crisis marks an escalation from a recent spate of murders claimed by Islamic State and al-Qaida on liberals, gays, foreigners and religious minorities, and could deal a major blow to the country's vital $25 billion garment sector.The restaurant assault also comes after Bangladesh hanged an Islamist party leader, Motiur Rahman Nizami, on May 11 for genocide and other crimes committed during a 1971 war of independence from Pakistan. That has drawn an angry reaction and some scattered violence from supporters. Nizami, 73, was a former legislator and minister during opposition leader Khaleda Zia's last term as prime minister.Last year, several Western retailers temporarily halted visits to Dhaka following the killing of two foreigners.Earlier on Friday, a Hindu priest was hacked to death at a temple in Jhinaidah district, 300km (188 miles) southwest of Dhaka.Both Islamic State and al Qaeda have claimed responsibility for many of the killings, although local authorities say no operational links exist between Bangladeshi militants and international jihadi networks.Bangladesh security officials say two local militant groups, Ansar-al-Islam and Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen, are behind the violence. Ansar pledges allegiance to al Qaeda, while Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen claims it represents Islamic State.""The bottom line is Bangladesh has plenty of local, often unaffiliated, militants and radicals happy to stage attacks in ISIS 's name,"" said Michael Kugelman, South Asia associate at The Wilson Centre in Washington D.C., using an acronym commonly used for Islamic State.Islamic State had claimed more attacks in Bangladesh than in Pakistan or Afghanistan, he said.Rizvi, the Bangladesh prime minister's adviser, said the hostage crisis began when security guards in the diplomatic enclave noticed several gunmen outside a medical centre.When the guards approached, the gunmen ran into the restaurant, which was packed with people waiting for tables, he added.An employee who escaped told local television about 20 customers were in the restaurant at the time, most of them foreigners. The restaurant has a seating capacity of around 25 people.Some 15 to 20 staff were working at the restaurant at the time, the employee said.In Video: 13 hostages rescued from Dhaka restaurant"

WASHINGTON: In a bizarre case, an American couple called police claiming they have been taken hostage by their pet cat.

The pair from Wisconsin decided to call the authorities to deal with the out-of-control cat, who minutes before had attacked the husband.

Talking to the operator, the woman said: ""This is gonna sound like a strange question but we have a cat and it's going crazy and it attacked my husband.""

""We're kind of hostage in our house and we're just wondering who we should call to do something, get rid of the cat or help us?""

In the end, the officers came over, the feisty cat was taken away and husband and wife escaped unharmed, almost.

The cat attacked the woman's husband last week. They put it in a room to calm down, but after they let it out, it attacked him again.

Police turned the cat over to animal control, WISN Milwaukee reported.

""There's been weirder (calls), but this is one of the more unusual ones. This one was unusual with the circumstances, but it's not unusual for us to handle animal complaints,"" Greenfield police Sgt Matt Borchardt said.

Animal control officer said the cat is currently in quarantine.

The incident kicked up a storm after Mumbai police alleged that the youngster intended to assassinate a prominent Mumbai politico, sparking criticism across the country.And while that's where Saurabh, who admits to being shaken by the incident, got the idea for his upcoming investigative thriller, 7 Hours to Go, he is quick to point out that the film is an amalgamation of several other real events, bound by fictional characters. ""My film has no political representation but the hostage crisis is the same. Someone who is new to Mumbai enters the city and holds it at ransom"".While that was a bus, my film is set in a courtroom in the High Court,"" the filmmaker points out, adding that the film could be described as an Ittefaqmeets-Neerja and also draws extensively from a case that can be likened with a mouse trapped inside a cage and making demands to the cats outside"".The case Saurabh is referring to was another widely-reported incident from November 2015 when the employees of a food ordering start-up took the co-founders of the firm, Gaurav Choudhary and Harshvardhan Mandad , hostage for two days after they were handed the pink slip through a mass e-mail. After police and politicians intervened to diffuse the crisis, over 20 employees received two months' salary and references for future jobs.""These pressure tactics don't make sense but symbolise the helplessness of the hostages and the man taking them hostage.

The police had come there to rescue two workers being held hostage by the strikers since two days. Mormugao police said two interns of a private auditing company, Dammor Joshi and Manish Bohest had been sent from the WISL head office two days back to carry out auditing work. Senior auditors were to join them later. The striking workers held Joshi and Bohest hostage at the shipyard for two days. On Saturday, when Mormugao PI Kapil Nayak, PSI Patil, along with some eight constables, entered the shipyard to release the auditors, the workers locked the gate from inside and sat in front of it shouting slogans against the company and the government. PI Nayak immediately telephoned the leader of the workers Ajit Singh Rane and warned of strict action. Rane arrived by 3pm and urged the workers to release the interns and co-operate with the police. He said the company had done the workers injustice by not paying them salaries in spite of assurances. He also blamed the chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar, local MLA and power minister Milind Naik and the government for not fulfilling their duties. Both Joshi and Bohest were taken to the police station, but they refused to lodge a complaint against the workers.

Samal and the other Indian were employed with a hospital in Sirte. Samal had earlier been reported to have called his sister in Odisa and told her that he had been released after he signed a bond saying that he was going to continue to work with the hospital.

Samal was flown back to India Thursday. He is said to have met NSA Ajit Doval after his return.

?While MEA was tight-lipped about his release, Samal himself thanked PM Narendra Modi and MEA for his release.

“I was deeply traumatized; every moment was a moment between life and death. It is only after coming here that I realized that the Prime Minister, the defence secretary and the whole security set up was so closely involved in saving me,” Samal was quoted as saying.

He said he and his colleague never thought something could happen to them as they were health workers. He said his kidnappers were from IS as the Sirte region is dominated by that terror group."

CHENNAI: Tension prevailed at the Central Prison in Puzhal on Friday evening after several inmates brutally attacked five prison officials and detained two of them at the high security block for nearly five hours. After prolonged negotiations by deputy inspector general of police (prisons) A G Maurya and DIG (prisons) in-charge S Rajendran, the attackers, including Al-Umma operatives, released assistant jailer Kumar and warden Ravi, police said.

All five officials, including warden Muthumani who is a regular member of teams assigned to search for mobile phones and contraband on the campus, jailer Ilavarasan and warden Mohan, are recovering at the Stanley Medical College and Hospital. They were attacked with iron rods and plates sharpened into weapons, allegedly because they continuously hindered the prisoners’ access to mobile phones and other banned stuff.

Prison sources said that at least 19 people, including suspected Al-Umma operatives Bilal Malik, Panna Ismail, S ‘Police’ Fakruddin and Mannadi Abdullah, had been detained in the high security block that is close to block 1.

Just before the various blocks were battened down for the evening, some of the prisoners who had access to block 1 sneaked into the place where warden Muthumani was. They dragged him out and beat him up black and blue, officials said. Hearing his cries, Ilavarasan, Kumar, Ravi and Mohan rushed to his side. The inmates set upon the four too and ‘locked up’ Kumar and Ravi in one of the cells. They were released only after talks with senior officials.

Based on the complaint from jailer Ilavarasan, the Puzhal police registered a fresh case against the 19 people detained in the high security block.

Inquiries revealed that those responsible for Friday’s assault allegedly came to know that several inmates of Coimbatore Central Prison, including some Al-Umma operatives and members of a few fundamentalist groups, were enjoying free access to many banned articles, including mobile phones, because of the ‘blessings’ of a senior official there. Furious that they were being denied the same access due to the adamant attitude of some officials at the Puzhal prison they resorted to violence, a senior prison official said.

MEERUT: Catching them off the guard, three criminals on Thursday afternoon took a two-member police team hostage at their rented home in Meerut’s upmarket Yashoda Kunj colony when the unsuspecting cops went there to cross check credentials of the tenants. The three men later fled in a car with a flat tyre, leaving behind a pile of ammunition, SIM cards and the two embarrassed policemen.

The cops had gone to the house to check record of the tenants after getting complaints from neighbours about their suspicious behaviour.

According to police, the suspects overpowered the policemen and fled in a car, leaving another car. Close to two dozen cartridges, a magazine and 12 SIM cards were found in house number 160 of posh Yashoda Kunj colony.

The house, owned by Vivek Shamra , a Lucknow-based banker, was rented out to Harjeet Singh on December 1 last year.

When contacted, Sharma said, “The man (Harjeet) told me that he, along with his younger brother, was preparing for competitive examinations. I rented out the property after procuring requisite documents for verification and rent agreement.”

Amid uncertainty over profile of the suspects, senior police officers have pressed several teams in action. Services of local unit of special task force (STF) are also being taken, police said.

“We don’t know background and criminal history of the suspects. A manhunt is on, we will soon get a breakthrough,” superintendent of police (Rural) Rajesh Kumar said.

Police have also secured CCTV DVR of the main entrance of the colony.

The incident has sent shock waves among the local residents in the gated colony.

Bhopal: A 17-year-old youth from Nepal was rescued from Chauhan Tiffin Centre in Harshwardhan Nagar where he was working since past three years without any wages.

As soon as the video was received, SJPU with a team of TT Nagar police station raided the spot within 20 minutes and rescued the teenager. In the video, Ajay (name changed) told that he came to Bhopal with his two friends and was initially working as a cook at a hostel. Later, when the hostel was shut and he was searching for work Sahdev Singh Chauhan, owner of Chauhan Tiffin Centre, lured him with a ""good salary job"". The tiffin centre is being run in a residential building illegally. When Ajay joined Chauhan's tiffin centre he was told that he would be paid the salary after six months, but he never got it. According to Ajay, an amount of about Rs 1 lakh for three years is due, which Chauhan owes it to him.

Ajay used to cook food for about 100 people, set up tiffins every day and also serve those who would come for lunch or dinner at the tiffin centre. In the video, he also sought help, as he wanted to go back home now. His two friends, with whom he came to Bhopal, had already left. Rajesh Tiwari, member of SJPU and head constable who led the rescue team, said, ""When we met him he told us that he did every possible work at the centre and was never allowed to move out of the house.""

BHOPAL: In a brazen display of muscle power, timber mafia allegedly took hostage a forest ranger and two forest guards in Damoh district on Thursday night. The three forest department employees were released when a tractor loaded with logs felled in a reserved forest area was freed forcibly by a group of 100 armed people.

More than 24 hours after the incident, the police have not registered an FIR because of usual slugfest over police jurisdiction.

Explaining the incident, sub-divisional officer (forest) Vidhyabhushan Singh told TOI, “There were six of us on the spot in a radius of 500 metres. When we confiscated the tractor loaded with logs, more than 100 armed men mobbed us. They must have been hiding in bushes and keeping a watch on us.”

“Sensing the danger, I ran for my life for almost a km. I somehow managed to sms my superiors and narrated them the incident,” Singh said. Of six forest department personnel on duty, deputy ranger CN Choubey and two forest guards Prabhat Pateria and Sanjeev Shakya were taken hostage as they were near tractor trolley, he said.

In the high-voltage drama lasting 3 hours, the mob did not allow trio to move from the spot. They were released when the tractor was taken away forcibly and reached its destination, he said.

The SDO said he and his teammates were sitting at Tendukheda police station till 10.30 pm, but the case was not registered.

Damoh police said there was a dispute over jurisdiction of two districts-whether the incident took place in Jabalpur or Damoh.

The SDO forest said: “Jabalpur is 1 km away from the place where the incident took place on Thursday.”

SP Damoh district Tilak Singh said, “The forest department was not able to explain the location where the incident took place and names of the people involved in it. “I have sent my officers to the spot again to find out facts.”

It is not an isolated case when the forest mafia manhandled the forest department employees. In fact, there has been a rise in number of cases of assault on forest department officials since 2014 by sand and forest mafia across the state.

GHAZIABAD: Three unidentified men robbed a house in Ghaziabad late on Monday evening after taking the owner, who is a trader, and his wife hostage at gunpoint. They fled with around Rs 10 lakh in cash, jewellery worth Rs 18 lakh, an SUV and other valuables.

The robbery took place in Agrawal’s second-floor apartment in Nehru Nagar-3 of Ghaziabad. The trader, Narendra Agrawal (57) and his wife Malti (57) were alone at home at the time of the incident. His son Abhisek (29), daughter-in-law Akanksha (26) and three-year-old granddaughter were on a return flight to Delhi from France where they had gone on a holiday around one week ago.

The robbers allegedly tied up Agrawal and his wife with trouser strings and strips of clothes after they took them at gunpoint. The couple was then dumped in one of the rooms, following which the robbers ransacked the entire house for around three hours.

On Monday, Agrawal, who trades in steel, had driven home from his office in Bulandshahr Road in his SUV around 8.30pm. His driver, Ashok, had left early. Abhisek, who reached Ghaziabad on Tuesday morning, told TOI that the men were lying in wait and ambushed his father when he reached home.

“Two men were already hiding near the staircase that leads from our main door to the terrace when my father reached home. They pointed a gun at his head as soon as he rang the doorbell and forcibly entered inside when my mother opened the door. Another man, who had probably been waiting downstairs, also entered the house. After tying up the hands and legs of my parents, the men dumped them in one of the rooms. They spent around three hours inside the flat and left after threatening my parents of dire consequences. The men consumed alcohol that was kept in the house and had some snacks during the time they were inside,” Abhisek told TOI.

Agrawal lodged a complaint in Sihani Gate police station of Ghaziabad on Tuesday, on the basis of which cops have registered an FIR under Section 394 (robbery) of IPC. According to family members, the robbers decamped with around Rs 10 lakh in cash, gold and silver jewellery worth Rs 18 lakh, a .32 bore licensed revolver, several bottles of liquor and 10 mobile phones, as well as the SUV.

Police susects this to be an insider’s job who knew the couple would be home alone.
