0,3,"Sanghamitra Deb scored 77 per cent in her HSLC exams

A 19-year-old girl from Tripura, who was ""married"" at 15 and is mother to a two-and-a-half-year-old son, has not only passed her Class 12 exams but has secured a top rank.

Sanghamitra Deb was ranked in the top ten in results released by the Tripura Board of Secondary Education on Friday. A student of the Arts stream, she scored an incredible 92.6 per cent to finish ninth amongst students of all streams and seventh in her own.

Ms Deb lives with in-laws in the northeastern state's Gandhigram town, which is located around 10 km from state capital Agartala. Her husband, Raju Ghosh, is a BSF (Border Security Force) soldier stationed in Kashmir.

""I studied (in) the time I got after managing household chores and taking care of my child. My in-laws helped of course. I am very happy with the results. Now I wish to complete graduations too in this manner,"" an elated Ms Deb, the daughter of a farmer in the same region, said.

The student of a local school, she secured 77 per cent in her HSLC (high school leaving exams), which she sat for a year after she was married.

Ms Deb's academic success does not, however, mask widespread concern over child marriages, which remain a serious and perennial problem in rural parts of the state.

According to a report by Young Lives, an agency that studies childhood poverty, data from the National Health and Family Survey indicates Tripura ranks second in terms of child marriages in India; around 21.6 per cent of all marriages here involve those between the age of 15 and 19.

2,10,"Union Minister G Kishan Reddy said there is 84 per cent recovery rate in Delhi (File)

All states should follow the ""Delhi model"" to control the spread of the COVID-19 virus, Union Minister of State (Home) G Kishan Reddy said Saturday, in a moment of praise for the Arvind Kejriwal government that has frequently found itself at odds with the centre over managing the outbreak in the national capital.

""You know, Delhi (is) a union territory (that) I am personally monitoring. There is 84 per cent recovery rate in Delhi. All the states should emulate the Delhi model,"" Kishan Reddy said at an event in Hyderabad's Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (TIMS).

Mr Reddy's comments - he also referred to Delhi's 84 per cent recovery rate, which compares favourably with the national average of 64.52 per cent - comes a day after Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal rejected two moves by Mr Kejriwal's government as part of the third phase of easing the lockdown.

The COVID-19 situation continues to be ""fragile"" and the threat is still ""far from over"", which is why this decision has been taken, news agency PTI quoted sources in his office as saying in response to questions over his latest reversal of Delhi government orders.

The rejection prompted Mr Kejriwal's AAP (Aam Aadmi Party) to demand the centre stop interfering in its decisions, particularly since coronavirus cases in the national capital appear to be on the decline; the city has now dropped to 11th place on the list of active cases.

""The centre derives sadistic pleasure by inflicting pain and misery on people of Delhi and undermining the democratically elected government of Delhi,"" AAP spokesperson Raghav Chadha said.

Mr Baijal, who represents the centre and chairs the Delhi Disaster Management Authority, has in the past scrapped a number of others orders pitched by the Delhi government.

In June he cancelled a decision to reserve hospitals (except those run by the centre) for residents of Delhi. He also reversed a decision to test only those showing symptoms and said asymptomatic cases and high-risk contacts of a virus patient should also be tested.

Meanwhile, Mr Kishan Reddy also called on Telangana to increase coronavirus testing.

""I am requesting state government to focus on testing, tracing and treatment. There is a need to increase the number of tests. The more number of the tests, the faster the containment of the disease,"" he added.

Mr Reddy's call to increase testing was the subject on which the Delhi High Court grilled the Kejriwal government this week; the court demanded to know why the less accurate RAT (rapid antigen test) was being favoured over the RT-PCR test.

Delhi, which can conduct 11,000 RT-PCR tests a day but did not carry out more than 600 per day between July 15 and July 23. The drop in RT-PCR tests also coincided with a drop in the number of new cases reported in the city every day.

Mr Reddy also assured Telangana, which has reported over 62,000 COVID-19 cases so far, of support from the centre, pointing out that 1,200 ventilators and large consignments of N95 face masks and PPEs (personal protective equipment) were being to the state.

India is hurtling towards 17 lakh coronavirus cases, of which over 36,000 are deaths and more than 5.65 lakh are active cases. The country took just 73 days to go from one lakh cases to 16 lakh; it reached that mark yesterday. Over 60 per cent of the cases and 50 per cent of deaths have been recorded in July.

3,11,"Sushant Singh Rajput case: Investigation will follow money trail, Bihar Police has said

The Bihar government is willing to order a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation into actor Sushant Singh Rajput's death if his family requests the state to do so, sources have said. The actor's family had filed a cheating case against his girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty.

Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has said he is open to recommending the CBI probe into Mr Rajput's death if the actor's father wants it and requests the state government for it.

The investigation has flared into a tug of war between the Bihar and Mumbai Police, while the Enforcement Directorate, which probes financial crimes, filed a money laundering case against Ms Chakraborty, also an actor, and her family.

""The Chief Minister will definitely act if demand for a CBI inquiry comes from the family of Rajput,"" said Bihar minister Sanjay Kumar Jha, who's a close aide of Nitish Kumar, according to news agency PTI.

Nitish Kumar's willingness to recommend a CBI probe a month after the actor's death comes amid criticism from Rajputs in Bihar, mostly the youth, who are angry over the issue.

The clamour for transferring the police probe to the CBI is growing. Ms Chakraborty on Friday issued a statement on video, refuting the allegations against her, saying, ""Truth will prevail"".

Her statement came hours after the ED filed the money laundering case based on a First Information Report (FIR) by Mr Rajput's father KK Singh against Ms Chakraborty and her family. The police complaint mentions ""suspicious"" transactions in tranches up to Rs 15 crore.

Ms Chakraborty and some others are expected to be called for questioning in the case soon, ED sources have said.

The investigation into the death of the actor will follow the money trail, the Bihar Police has said.

Mr Rajput created two companies with Ms Chakraborty and her brother as directors, the police said. The registered addresses of the two firms are a flat in Raigad's Ulwe town in Maharashtra, owned by Ms Chakraborty's father, investigators have said.

The Bihar Police are checking how money transferred from the actor's account was used. A police team visited several banks in Mumbai and looked into transactions and investments of the companies.

The investigation focusses on whether the investments made by the actor and his girlfriend were clean.

""For a good 45 days, they (Mumbai Police) did not do anything to unravel the mystery shrouding Rajput's death, except for using the time to indulge in photo-op and event management... and now when the Bihar Police team is doing a sincere probe they are creating hurdles for them,"" said Mr Jha, state Water Resources Minister.

The Mumbai Police are conducting a detailed investigation into other angles like professional rivalry and unfair treatment, leading to the actor being sidelined. They have also looked into his finances.

The Bihar government is already supporting the bereaved family in court, with a caveat in the Supreme Court blocking Ms Chakraborty's efforts to transfer the case against her to Mumbai.",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/if-sushant-singh-rajputs-father-wants-can-recommend-cbi-probe-says-nitish-kumar-2272530,2020-08-01T00:00:00+00:00,"If Sushant Rajput's Father Wants, Can Recommend CBI Probe: Nitish Kumar",Murder,/Rajput:Mumbai,Rajput,Mumbai

Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram has criticised the centre for extending the detention of former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti under the stringent Public Safety Act (PSA) for three more months. This would make the duration of her detention longer than a year; she was detained for the first time on August 5 last year, the day the centre scrapped special status to Jammu and Kashmir and divided the state into two Union Territories.

9,21,"Top US official said he hopes that China and Russia are actually testing the vaccine. (Representational)

America's top infectious diseases official has raised concerns over the safety of COVID-19 vaccines being developed by China and Russia as the world scrambles for answers to a pandemic the WHO warned will be felt for decades.

Six months after the World Health Organization declared a global emergency, the novel coronavirus has killed at least 679,000 people and infected at least 17.9 million, according to an AFP tally.

As countries across Western Europe announced new lockdowns and reported historic economic slumps, the UN health body said the pandemic was a ""once-in-a-century"" crisis and its fallout would be felt for decades.

Several Chinese companies are at the forefront of the race to develop an immunity to the disease and Russia has set a target date of September to roll out its own vaccine.

But US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said it was unlikely his country would use any vaccine developed in either country, where regulatory systems are far more opaque than they are in the West.

""I do hope that the Chinese and the Russians are actually testing the vaccine before they are administering the vaccine to anyone,"" he told a US Congressional hearing on Friday.

""Claims of having a vaccine ready to distribute before you do testing, I think, is problematic, at best.""

As part of its own ""Operation Warp Speed,"" the US government will pay pharma giants Sanofi and GSK up to $2.1 billion for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, the companies said.

In east Asia, territories which saw success in tackling the early wave of the coronavirus are now confronting worrying new spikes.

Japan's Okinawa declared a state of emergency Saturday after a record jump in cases on the island -- many linked to US military forces stationed there -- while Hong Kong opened a new makeshift hospital to house COVID-19 patients.

The finance hub had been a poster child for tackling the coronavirus, with local transmissions all but ended by early summer.

But since July daily cases have risen to record highs, partly brought in by the tens of thousands of people who were exempted from a mandatory quarantine imposed on most arrivals.

Fresh lockdowns

France, Spain, Portugal and Italy all reported huge contractions in their economies for the April-June quarter, while Europe as a whole saw gross domestic product fall by 12.1 percent.

In a sign of the trade-offs being forced on European governments, Britain imposed new lockdowns Friday on millions of households in northern England.

With large Muslim populations in those areas, the ban was painfully timed, on the eve of the Eid-al-Adha festival.

Meanwhile, in the United States -- the world's biggest economy and hardest-hit nation -- jobless Americans were bracing for an end to extra unemployment payments after Congress failed to reach a deal on extending benefits.

It came just a day after the US posted a second-quarter GDP drop of 9.5 percent from the same period a year ago, the worst it had ever recorded.

Sect leader arrested

Fresh off a bout of COVID-19, Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro said Friday nearly everyone will probably end up catching the new coronavirus, urging Brazilians to ""face up to it"" and saying there was nothing to fear.

His comments came as Brazil's death toll closes on 100,000 and as Latin America's biggest airline LATAM said it was laying off at least 2,700 crew over the coronavirus.

In South Korea the elderly leader of a secretive sect at the center of the country's early coronavirus outbreak was arrested Saturday for allegedly hindering the government's effort to contain the epidemic.

People linked to Lee Man-hee's Shincheonji Church of Jesus accounted for more than half of the South's coronavirus cases in February and March, when the country was enduring one of the worst early outbreaks in the world.

The South has since been returning largely to normal, appearing to have brought the outbreak under control with an extensive ""trace, test and treat"" program.

Veteran BJP leaders LK Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi will ""definitely be invited"" to the ground-breaking ceremony for building of a temple in UP's Ayodhya on August 5, sources in the trust set up to oversee the construction said on Saturday, hours after it seemed that neither would receive such an invitation.

Both will be invited via phone calls, as all other leaders have been too, sources added. The invitations are being co-ordinated by Champat Rai, the General Secretary of the Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust, which was set up by the Supreme Court after its landmark verdict in November last year.

Former Union Minister Uma Bharti and former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Kalyan Singh, who told NDTV he had no regrets over the events of December 6, 1992 - when the Babri mosque was destroyed - and that he had already paid the price, got their invitations today.

They have said that they will be at the event, for which Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also been invited and will attend.

Last week Mr Advani appeared before a special CBI court in Lucknow via video link to answer questions relating to the mosque's razing. Mr Advani, 92, who is among the accused in the case and was asked more than 1,000 questions over four-and-a-half hours, has denied all charges, according to his lawyer.

Mr Joshi, another senior BJP leader who recorded his statement before the same court, said that those who had deposed against him done so for political reasons and that all allegations against him were false.

Mr Advani, Mr Joshi and Uma Bharti are among the BJP leaders accused of conspiracy.

Uma Bharti, who is also an ex-Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister, also recorded a statement. She declared that the judgement in the hugely contentious case did not matter to her.

""I was called by the court for my statement and I have told the court what was true. It does not matter to me what the judgement will be. If I am sent to the gallows, I will be blessed,"" she told NDTV

The groundbreaking ceremony for the Ram Temple will be held in Ayodhya next week

In the 1990s, Mr Advani was the face of the movement to build a Ram temple in Ayodhya, where the 16th century Babri mosque stood till it was pulled down on December 6, 1992.

The CBI has said Mr Advani, and other leaders like Mr Joshi, Uma Bharti and Kalyan Singh made incendiary speeches from a dais close to the mosque, which motivated the razing of the structure.

Meanwhile, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, whose Shiv Sena broke away from long-time ally BJP in dramatic fashion after Assembly elections, has yet to be invited.

His party has demanded an invitation, saying it had given ""blood and sweat"" for the temple.

Last week Mr Thackeray, who said he did not need an invitation to attend the ceremony, sparked criticism after suggesting the ceremony could be conducted via video links due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Mr Thackeray's Bihar counterpart, Nitish Kumar, whose Janata Dal (United) is in a tenuous relationship with ally BJP ahead of Assembly elections in the state later this year, is also expected to be invited but no formal invitation has been sent, so far.

An elaborate guest list has been trimmed to around 50 VIPs because of restrictions on travel and gatherings during the coronavirus outbreak, the trust has said.

Grand preparations have been made for the ceremony next week, which will revolve around the installation of a 40 kg silver brick as the foundation stone; this will be set by the Prime Minister.

In November 2019, the Supreme Court ruled that the then disputed 2.77 acres in Ayodhya would be given to a government-run trust for the building of a temple for Lord Ram and Muslims will be given a five-acre ""suitable"" plot elsewhere in the district.

The verdict, in a case that has been and continues to be a religious and political flashpoint, was passed unanimously by a five-judge constitution bench amid appeals for peace by political and religious leaders and heightened security across the country.

All states should follow the ""Delhi model"" to control the spread of the COVID-19 virus, Union Minister of State (Home) G Kishan Reddy said Saturday, in a moment of praise for the Arvind Kejriwal government that has frequently found itself at odds with the centre over managing the outbreak in the national capital.

""You know, Delhi (is) a union territory (that) I am personally monitoring. There is 84 per cent recovery rate in Delhi. All the states should emulate the Delhi model,"" Kishan Reddy said at an event in Hyderabad's Telangana Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (TIMS).

Mr Reddy's comments - he also referred to Delhi's 84 per cent recovery rate, which compares favourably with the national average of 64.52 per cent - comes a day after Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal rejected two moves by Mr Kejriwal's government as part of the third phase of easing the lockdown.

The COVID-19 situation continues to be ""fragile"" and the threat is still ""far from over"", which is why this decision has been taken, news agency PTI quoted sources in his office as saying in response to questions over his latest reversal of Delhi government orders.

The rejection prompted Mr Kejriwal's AAP (Aam Aadmi Party) to demand the centre stop interfering in its decisions, particularly since coronavirus cases in the national capital appear to be on the decline; the city has now dropped to 11th place on the list of active cases.

""The centre derives sadistic pleasure by inflicting pain and misery on people of Delhi and undermining the democratically elected government of Delhi,"" AAP spokesperson Raghav Chadha said.

Mr Baijal, who represents the centre and chairs the Delhi Disaster Management Authority, has in the past scrapped a number of others orders pitched by the Delhi government.

In June he cancelled a decision to reserve hospitals (except those run by the centre) for residents of Delhi. He also reversed a decision to test only those showing symptoms and said asymptomatic cases and high-risk contacts of a virus patient should also be tested.

Meanwhile, Mr Kishan Reddy also called on Telangana to increase coronavirus testing.

""I am requesting state government to focus on testing, tracing and treatment. There is a need to increase the number of tests. The more number of the tests, the faster the containment of the disease,"" he added.

Mr Reddy's call to increase testing was the subject on which the Delhi High Court grilled the Kejriwal government this week; the court demanded to know why the less accurate RAT (rapid antigen test) was being favoured over the RT-PCR test.

Delhi, which can conduct 11,000 RT-PCR tests a day but did not carry out more than 600 per day between July 15 and July 23. The drop in RT-PCR tests also coincided with a drop in the number of new cases reported in the city every day.

Mr Reddy also assured Telangana, which has reported over 62,000 COVID-19 cases so far, of support from the centre, pointing out that 1,200 ventilators and large consignments of N95 face masks and PPEs (personal protective equipment) were being to the state.

India is hurtling towards 17 lakh coronavirus cases, of which over 36,000 are deaths and more than 5.65 lakh are active cases. The country took just 73 days to go from one lakh cases to 16 lakh; it reached that mark yesterday. Over 60 per cent of the cases and 50 per cent of deaths have been recorded in July.

12,30,"Delhi BJP MP Gautam Gambir hit out at the AAP government over the Covid situation in the capital.

BJP MP Gautam Gambhir on Saturday hit out at the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi over its handling of the coronavirus situation in the capital. The cricketer-turned-MP referred to the state government's earlier estimation that there will be 5.5 lakh COVID-19 cases in Delhi by July 31.

""Yesterday, it was being said that people should stay safe or else the (coronavirus) cases would touch 5.5 lakh. Today they're saying don't interfere, or else, they will take (you) to court,"" Mr Gambhir tweeted in Hindi.

The tweet comes a day after Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal rejected two moves by the Arvind Kejriwal government as part of the third phase of easing the COVID-19 lockdown.

Mr Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party government had allowed hotels to reopen from Saturday and a one-week trial for the weekly markets in the city as part of ""Unlock 3"". Mr Baijal, who represents the central government and chairs the Delhi Disaster Management Authority, has ruled that these orders cannot be implemented.

Delhi registered 1,195 new coronavirus cases on Friday, taking the capital's tally past 1.35 lakh. The number of deaths has risen to 3,963.

The Dellhi BJP on Friday said Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia tried to ""scare"" people by claiming that COVID-19 cases in the city will reach 5.5 lakh by July 31, but that the situation was brought under control with the intervention of Union Home Minister Amit Shah.

13,31,"Media reports of that period show that ""Dr Death"" had committed more than 100 murders

An ayurvedic doctor jailed for life for murdering truck drivers and feeding their remains to crocodiles has been caught after jumping parole while on release for good behaviour, police said.

Devendra Kumar Sharma, 62, was arrested by Delhi police in the capital late Tuesday. In January he failed to return from a weeks-long parole after serving 16 years behind bars.

Sharma was given a life sentence in 2004 in Rajasthan after being found guilty of several murders between 2002 and 2004, earning him the nickname ""Dr Death"" in the media.

""(He) was involved in dozens of cases of kidnapping and murder of truck and taxi drivers in Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan,"" Delhi Police Deputy Commissioner Rakesh Paweriya said in a statement.

Police alleged that Sharma first came to the attention of authorities two decades ago over his involvement in an illegal kidney transplant racket between 1994 and 2004.

Sharma, with help from other doctors and middlemen, allegedly arranged at least 125 transplants in an organ trafficking racket.

Police also accused him of being part of a gang that hired taxis and trucks before killing their drivers, robbing them and selling the vehicles.

""They used to dump dead bodies in Hazara canal in Uttar Pradesh's Kashganj, which had crocodiles, (and) there was no chance of retrieval of any body,"" Mr Paweriya said.

Sharma was later convicted of at least six murders, police said, but Mr Paweriya added that he had admitted to carrying out many more.

""He disclosed to have been (the) mastermind of more than 50 such murders,"" the statement said.

""Media reports of that period show that he had committed more than 100 murders of taxi drivers for which cases were registered in Delhi, UP, Haryana and Rajasthan.""

“We are from a very simple family. My brother had no Godfather when he was in Bollywood nor do we have anyone right now.

“My request to you is to immediately look into this case and make sure that everything is handled in a sanitised way and no evidences are tampered with. Expecting justice to prevail,” she wrote.

Sushant was found dead at his Bandra residence last month. The actor’s untimely demise was followed by a high-profile investigation by Mumbai Police during which many big names from Bollywood, including filmmakers Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Aditya Chopra, recorded their statements.

Over a month after the actor’s death, his father lodged a police complaint in Patna on Tuesday against his girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty, accusing her of abetting the suicide.

In his complaint, Krishna Kumar Singh, who had been maintaining a stoic silence over the tragic death of his 34-year-old son, sought to invoke the provisions of the Mental Health Care Act, alleging that the “machinations” of Ms. Rhea and her family members had caused his son to crack up, despite a successful career in films, and ultimately drove him to suicide.

In her post on Instagram, Shweta also said that she believes in the judicial system and expects “justice at any cost“.

Ankita Lokhande, who dated Sushant for over six years till 2016 after working with him on hit TV soap “Pavitra Rishta”, commented #satyamevajayate on Shweta’s post.

On Friday, Ms. Ankita told a news channel that she stands with Sushant’s family in these testing times and wants to know the reason behind his death.

“I’m saying he was not depressed and if somebody is saying it’s suicide, I want to know why. If somebody is saying he was murdered, I want to know who did it?

“I am standing with Sushant’s family. I also want to know what happened. One thing I am sure is that depression, is impossible for me to believe that it happened,” she said.

Meanwhile, Ms. Rhea broke her silence on Friday evening and released a statement through her lawyers, saying that she had “immense faith” in the judiciary and believes she will get justice.

“Even though a lot of horrible things are being said about me on the electronic media, I refrain from commenting on the advice of my lawyers as the matter is sub-judice. Satyamev Jayate, the truth shall prevail,” the actor added.
