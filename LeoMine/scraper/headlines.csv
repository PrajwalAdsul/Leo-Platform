0,10,16,"Khammam: He waited 40 days as the lockdown kept getting extended, and when the special trains were announced it seemed like a ray of hope. But his village was nowhere near the train routes decided by the Centre. So 25-year-old Kasa Madakami and other migrant labourers began a 500-km walk from Hyderabad to Pandripani village in Malkangiri district in Odisha. After four days in the scorching heat, his journey ended abruptly in Bhadrachalam where he collapsed and died.
Madakami had been employed as a construction worker in Hyderabad. For him and his companions there was no hope left in the city after all the construction work had stopped. The only thing left to do was to go home to their families in their native villages, where everybody knew their names, where somebody cared for them.
 
It was just four days ago, after 40 days of being unemployed and stranded that they decided to start walking, with no hope of getting any government arranged means of transport. Left to their own means, they did not carry enough water and food with for the journey, Madakam Naresh, Madakami’s co-traveller, said.
Walking an average of 80 km a day, they had covered a distance of 320 km and reached Bhadrachalam in 40-degree Celsius heat on Tuesday.
All of a sudden, Madakami collapsed.
He was immediately taken to a hospital but doctors declared him dead on arrival. It was sunstroke, they said.
The long walk without water and food in the punishing heat had claimed its victim. “It is a very sad incident in our lives,” Naresh said.
Shocked by his death, Madakami’s friends asked the police for help to take his body home. They hired a vehicle and travelled to Pandripani village in Odisha.
Finally it was the youngster’s dead body that reached home.

1,11,17,"Mumbai: Big ticket releases such as Amitabh Bachchan’s Gulabo Sitabo may bypass theatres and premiere directly on digital platforms, being seen as a potential saviour for the film industry in a year marred by the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertainty over when cinemas will open.
Faced with the question of going ‘direct to digital’ or waiting for theatres to open after the situation improves, many filmmakers and production houses are exploring the option of heading to streaming platforms, industry insiders said.
 
Shoojit Sircar’s Amitabh-Ayushman Khurrana starrer Gulabo Sitabo, Anu Menon’s eponymous biopic on math genius Shakuntala Devi, with Vidya Balan in the title role, as well as Chehre, another Amitabh film, are among the films likely to be released soon on a streaming platform.
“The deal of releasing ‘Gulabo Sitabo’, a quirky comedy set in Lucknow, and ‘Shakuntala Devi’ on Amazon Prime Video has been locked. The official announcement for both the films is most likely to be made this week,” a source close to the streamer told PTI.
Ronnie Lahiri, producer on “Gulabo Sitabo”, neither confirmed nor denied reports when PTI reached out to him but asked journalists to wait for an official statement.
An insider on the team of “Shakuntala Devi” also did not comment about the film’s digital release.
“Chehre” producer Anand Pandit said a digital release was under consideration.
“Given how the lockdown is panning out, a digital release for ‘Chehre’ is being mulled,” Pandit said, adding they would wait till the first week of June to take a final call.
The one official announcement was the release of Nawazuddin Siddiqui’s film “Ghoomketu”, which streamed on ZEE5 last week.
Most other plans are shrouded in secrecy with officials reluctant to come on record. But the list of 2020 films that will be released on streaming platforms is long, said insiders.
Top on the list is Laxmmi Bomb, featuring Akshay Kumar and backed by Fox Star Studios, which has reportedly been picked up by the recently launched service Disney+ Hotstar. However, Hotstar representatives maintained a “no comment” stance as did producer Tusshar Kapoor.
The movie, directed by Raghava Lawrence, was scheduled to be released on May 22 in theatres. That is unlikely to happen with no signs of cinema theatres opening even if the lockdown ends.
The other 2020 releases—Varun Dhawan-starrer Coolie No 1, Bachchan’s Jhund and Jahnvi Kapoor’s ‘Gunjan Saxena’—are also likely to head to different OTT platforms.
Kiara Advani-starrer Indoo Ki Jawani, co-produced by Nikkhil Advani and Bhushan Kumar, is also reportedly looking for a digital release.
However, Advani said the film is currently being edited “despite physical constraints” and the team is optimistic it will be ready “very soon”.
“We are exploring all possible avenues. Nothing stands confirmed or committed. As soon as we are clear about the way ahead, we will make a statement,” he said.
Bhushan’s T-Series’ has two other films, Ludo and Jhund.
While questions sent to Bhushan on the slate of his films were unanswered, a source from the production house confirmed that T-Series is planning to release its films digitally and talks are currently on.
There are also some producers who want to wait it out.
Producer Jackky Bhagnani, who was looking forward to the theatrical release of  Coolie No 1 on May 1, said he is not thinking about films right now.
“Let us overcome this crisis and we will announce in happier times,” Bhagnani said when asked about whether he was looking at releasing the film digitally.
Reliance Entertainment said it will wait to release two of this year’s most awaited films — Akshay starrer Sooryavanshi, and ‘83’, fronted by Ranveer Singh.
The team will wait for the lockdown to be lifted and release these movies in theatres.
“We will first complete the film then we will wait. If six or nine months down the line the situation becomes much worse we will take a call at that time. There is no hurry. Same is the case with Sooryavanshi and our other films,” Reliance Entertainment Group CEO Shibashish Sarkar told PTI last month.
Irrfan Khan’s last film Angrezi Medium headed to OTT platforms soon after its theatrical release as the lockdown led to cinema halls being closed.
“There is a lot of big money involved. Also, if you release on OTT you cannot release it in theatres. If you release a film in theatre it will come on satellite as well as digital later,” said trade analyst Taran Adarsh.
Last week, the Multiplex Association of India (MAI) appealed to studio partners, producers, artistes and content creators to support the cinema exhibition sector by holding their films and releasing them in theatres once they reopen.
The statement followed reports that several films were looking at a direct to digital release amid the lockdown.
The combination of “pent-up demand” and the promise of new movies would boost film business and contribute massively in reviving the industry, the association said.
“The collective, social experience of watching films on the big screen needs to be preserved and it can be done so only with the collective support of all stakeholders,” the statement from the body read.
“One can’t say the film will lose or gain from a digital release, because when you release a good film in theatres, the sky is the limit,” Adarsh added.

2,12,18,"Hyderabad: The relative of a person who died of Covid-19 on Sunday has refuted the Telangana government’s claim in its official daily Covid-19 media bulletin that there were no Covid-related deaths on Sunday. The death was not reported in the bulletin issued on Monday as well.
Aditya Belde, a resident of Ziaguda, said his 51-year-old paternal uncle died of the disease at Gandhi Hospital at around 10 am Sunday. “I want to know why his death has not been reported in the official bulletin which was released much later in the day. I think the officials had enough time to update the information,” he said.
 
Belde took to Twitter on Monday to report the death and sought an explanation from the government on the omission of his uncle’s demise from the health department’s report on the Covid-19 situation on Sunday.
Belde’s uncle had been suffering from a heart ailment for a few years. On Thursday, May 7, his health deteriorated, so the family took him to a private hospital. There, they were asked to get him tested for Covid-19 at a government hospital.
“My relatives took my uncle to Fever Hospital the same day. He was taken inside for just around 10 minutes, after which they said he didn’t have Covid-19 and could be taken home,” he said.
The patient’s health continued to deteriorate, and on Friday evening, the family took him to a corporate hospital in Begumpet, where he was treated previously. The doctors at this hospital informed the family that the patient needed to be on a ventilator and that he should be tested for Covid-19.
Accordingly a sample was collected and sent to Gandhi Hospital. “On Saturday night, the test results came back and we found he was Covid-19 positive,” said Belde.
Almost immediately, his uncle was processed for a transfer to Gandhi Hospital. Belde was told to accompany his uncle to do the formalities there. “We reached Gandhi Hospital at around 4:30 am and it took an hour before he was admitted. I wasn’t allowed to be near him but I could observe from a distance,” he said.
He returned home after a couple of hours. At around noon on Sunday, he got a call from a policeman who told him his uncle had passed away at 10 am on Sunday. By evening, the cremation had been arranged at a local crematorium, which no family member was able to attend.
Nine members of the deceased man’s family, including Belde, were transported to an isolation facility at the Government Ayurvedic Hospital at Erragadda as they lived together as a joint family.
Their swabs have since been taken for Covid-19 tests. Belde wonders why the government did not add his uncle’s death to the official bulletin. “It is very confusing. We need some clarity on this matter,” he said.
The family is also upset that their sick relative was made to run around various hospitals for three days before he was tested positive for Covid-19.
“At Coranti (Fever Hospital) they examined him for just 10 minutes and sent him home. They didn’t even collect his samples. Had he been tested earlier, he could have been saved,” Belde said.
At the corporate hospital the doctors told them about the test result only after they had made payment for the treatment there. “We paid Rs 1.70 lakh for my uncle’s treatment. Just 15 minutes later, we were told he was Covid-19 positive. We are extremely suspicious about this, to say the least,” he said.
Belde said that his uncle had no travel history. “Since the lockdown began in March, he left the house only a few times. He only went out to buy vegetables and groceries. He had no travel history,” he said.

3,13,19,"A recent post on M.S. Dhoni’s daughter Ziva’s account, which is managed by her parents, a video shows India’s most experienced Indian wicketkeeper and batsman enjoying quality father-daughter moments with Ziva.
In the video, the duo seem to be running a friendly race on their large, well-mowed and primly tended-to lawn at his Ranchi home.
 
And then began the relentless posts of the Captain Cool’s ‘latest looks’ of him with a full-grown salt-and-pepper beard, wearing a green T-shirt with the words “SPECIAL FORCES AIRBORNE” on it, standing
However, former Team Blues captain’s latest grey-bearded look seems to have disappointed many of his fans, sending Twitter into a frenzy. Some seem to have simply seen him as an unshaven, old man! “Aww... M. S Dhoni in Salt And Pepper Look... :-)) ?? (sic),” a CSK fan wrote.
In addition to comments highlighting disappointments were memes that showed “before and after” photos of Captain Cool.
One fan, for instance, posted two of Dhoni’s pictures. One was of his when he arrived in Chennai for the practice games of the now-called-off IPL matches sometime last month, seen clean-shaven with a close-crop crew-cut haircut. The second picture was a recent one of him in which he is seen.
One such meme had the caption, “Dhoni before lockdown vs after lockdown. March month he arrived Chennai with a fresh look & we would hve seen him in #Yellove now But corona had other idea & Ruined everything ????.”
Another CSK fan posted his recent pic and wrote against it, “How the men looks after carrying the entire burden and blame for past 10 years..!  This pic is very emotional msdians.. (sic).”
Another supposedly shaken fan wrote, “Dhoni looks so old.. (sic).”
Mother knows best
Even as people have been sharing sad emojis and wondering about their favourite cricketer’s cricketing plans (and there are indeed speculations about his retirement), his mother, Devaki, seems far from worried.
Speaking exclusively on the telephone from Ranchi, Devaki tells us, “Yes, I have seen his new look, but he’s not that old. No child is ever old for any mother.”
As for our apprehensions about his quitting the game, she adds, “I am not sure about his playing the TT-20 World Cup. He knows best when to take a call. Let the coronavirus outbreak get over first.”
Of course, there were compliments pouring in for the look too. “Vintage white beard look,” one fan wrote with the fire emoji next to it.

4,15,21,"Lucknow: At least eight Uttar Pradesh police personnel, including a deputy superintendent of police, were killed in an encounter with criminals in Kanpur, officials said on Friday.

The encounter took place when the police team was approaching to arrest Vikas Dubey, a history sheeter facing 60 criminal cases, in Dikru village under Chaubeypur police station on the intervening night of Thursday and Friday, police said.

As the police team was about to reach the hideout of the dreaded criminal, a hail of bullets was showered on them from a building rooftop, leaving Deputy SP Devendra Mishra, three sub-inspectors and four constables dead, officials said.

Giving details of the incident, Uttar Pradesh Director General of Police H C Awasthi said the notorious criminal might have got an inkling of the impending raid.

He and his henchmen put up massive roadblocks to prevent the police personnel from proceeding towards their hideout. As the police team was caught unawares, the criminals fried at them from a building rooftop leading to the deaths, Awasthi said.

On getting information about the incident, additional DG (Law and Order), IG (Kanpur) and the senior SP of Kanpur rushed to the spot, where a forensic team has started investigations. The forensic team will be joined by another team from Lucknow.

The Special Task Force (STF) of the Uttar Pradesh police has also been pressed into action, the DGP said.

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath paid tributes to the slain policemen and conveyed his heartfelt condolences to their family members.

According to a spokesperson, he directed the police chief to take stringent action against the culprits and collect detailed report from the spot immediately.

Opposition hits back at Yogi government

Opposition parties in Uttar Pradesh, including the Congress and Samajwadi Party, lashed out at the Yogi Adityanath government over the killing of eight policemen, saying no one was safe in the state.

Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra took to Twitter to condole the deaths.

""Eight policemen were martyred while they went to nab criminals. I pay my condolence to the family of the martyrs. In UP, law and order has become very bad and criminals have no fear. From common man to policemen, no one is safe,"" she said.

""The responsibility of law and order is with the chief minister. He should initiate strict action and there should be no laxity in it,"" she added.

Her brother and former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, too, attacked the Yogi government over the killings. He tweeted: ""Another proof of 'Gundaraj' in UP. When the police are not safe, how will the public be? My heartfelt condolences are with the families of the slain martyrs and I wish the injured a speedy recovery,"" he said in a tweet in Hindi.

Gandhi also expressed his condolence to the family of those dead and wished speedy recovery of the injured.

The Samjwadi Party said Uttar Pradesh has become ""hatya pradesh"" (murder state).

"" In 'rogi sarkar' 'jungleraj', UP has become 'hatya pradesh', where in Kanpur criminals patronised by those in power attacked policemen killing eight of them,"" Samajwadi Party said in a tweet.

While condoling the deaths, the SP has demanded an ""immediate announcement of Rs 1 crore each for the martyred policemen's family"".

It also demanded that the alleged ""connection (of criminals) with those in power should be exposed"".",https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/crime/030720/8-up-cops-killed-in-encounter-with-criminals-in-kanpur.html,Riot,/Uttar:Lucknow,Uttar,Lucknow
5,16,22,"After several weeks of liming tests, Telangana began to test more since mid-Jne.

Hyderabad: Telangana recorded 1,892 new cases of coronavirus infection on Friday. It's the state's biggest single-day spurt so far. Only three other states in the country recorded more cases on Friday: Maharashtra (6,364), Tamil Nadu (4,329), Delhi (2,520).

This tally does not include the results from one private laboratory which reported 2,672 positive cases. That data has been kept on hold for closer inspection.

There were eight deaths on Friday, also the highest sing-day occurrence since the health department began issuing its daily COVID-19 medical bulletin. The toll stands at 283 in the state.

The current spurt in coronavirus cases may persuade the state government to bring in strict containment measures such as a lockdown and daytime curfew, which it has hinted at in recent days.

Of the new cases recorded on Friday, 1,658 patients were from the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation limits. Most other districts also showed a remarkable spurt in cases.

Ranga Reddy had 56 new cases, Medchal 44, Sangareddy 20, Mahbubnagar 12, Warangal Rural 41, Mahbubabad 7, Mahbubnagar 12 and Nalgonda 13.

An expert committe of the government is looking at the astoundingly high coronavirus positive results reported by a private laboratory. The lab reported 2,672 positive from a batch of 3,726 samples that it tested. That gives it a positivity rate of 71.7 per cent.

The results of these cases have been kept on hold until the expert committee looks at the figures.

Experts did not rule out the possibility of this concentration of coronavirus cases; they could be people living in an infected cluster.

The testing module is the same across the city and only those laboratories that have certification from the Indian Council of Medical Research are allowed to test.

The issue of keeping these results in abeyance raises the question of treatment of these cases while the tests are scrutinised by the expert committee.",https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/in-other-news/040720/massive-jump-in-telangana-1892-new-cases-plus-2762-uncertified-posit.html,Covid,/Nadu:Hyderabad,Nadu,Hyderabad
6,21,31,"Chennai: Even as Tamil Nadu Health Minister C Vijayabaskar urged the people not to fear coronavirus and to trust the government's preventive work, the total number of infections in the state crossed the one lakh mark on Friday. The total number of cases stood at 1,02,721 after 4,329 cases were detected on Friday.

Speaking to the media after visiting Stanley Medical College Hospital, Vijaybaskar said that the state had procured 10,000 vials of Remdesivir and was also in the process of getting 3 lakh injections of other drugs.

He said that the government was making arrangements to ensure supply of more oxygen to the hospitals through pipelines as the need for oxygen had surpassed that of ventilators. As of now government hospitals had the capacity for six kilo litre of oxygen, which would be increased to 40 kilo litre, he said.

The government was also looking into the possibility of finding a cure for COVID-19 through Siddha and Ayurveda systems of medicine, he said adding that the number of beds in Stanley would soon be increased to 1200 and another hospital with 500 beds would come up in Tambaram soon.

He requested people not to panic seeing the growing number of positive cases, which he said was because of the rigorous testing in the state. ""Investigations are done seriously and contact tracing has led to the number of tests in Chennai alone standing at 10,000 daily. All over the State 33,000 tests are being done,"" he said.

Vijaybaskar said that intense lockdown in the past two weeks was very helpful in bringing down the rate of infection.Tamil Nadu was the only state that was holding fever camps, he said, adding that 600 camps were being held daily reaching out to 40,000 people.

""The government has sought permission from the ICMR for plasma centres to be set up in Chennai, Madurai and Tirunelveli,"" he said, stressing on the point that no stone would be left unturned in the fight against COVID-19.

The number of deaths recorded in Tamil Nadu on Friday stood at 64, with 32 of them in Chennai alone. The state-wide discharge figure for the day stood at 2,357.
