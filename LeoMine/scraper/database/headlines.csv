It has been four months to the day since India was put into lockdown to ward off the coronavirus. During the anxious days of Lockdown 1.0,the peak was promised in a few weeks, and then late May. But when the lockdown was eased in May, the only peaks in sight were the Himalayas from Saharanpur.

Where then are the peaks of COVID? In the last few weeks, talk of India soon approaching the COVID-19 peak have begun to be heard in murmurs.

First, it was Public Health Foundation of India president Dr K Srinath Reddy who said that coronavirus incidence could peak in mid-September in India but added that different states could witness different peak periods. Now, it is Prof GVS Murthy of the Indian Institute of Public Health who has reiterated Dr Reddy's message elaborately.

There cannot be a uniform peak in COVID-19 cases in a large country like India and each state has its own trajectory based on when people there were exposed to the infection, Murthy told PTI on Saturday.

Now, among the states and Union Territories, Delhi is predicted to peak by the end of July or early August. While Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra – some of the worst-affected states in India – are likely to witness the corona peak in September, which is in line with Dr Reddy's prediction.

South of Vindhyas: Come September

""States like Telangana, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu should be able to achieve the maximum number of cases by mid-September,"" Murthy said, adding that these states are currently reporting high numbers but won't do so after mid-September.

Tamil Nadu may peak a bit quicker because it boiled up faster. The state with over 2 lakh confirmed cases of COVID-19 can witness its corona peak by the middle or the third week of August. However, the influx of guest workers made it worse for the southern state. Health minister C Vijaybaskar had blamed guest workers, especially those coming from Maharashtra, for the spurt in cases.

Maharashtra has also been held up as one of the contributors to the spurt in Karnataka. The latter state has nearly 91,000 cases but what is more worrying is the slipping recovery rate of patients. Karnataka now has a recovery rate of around 37 per cent, which is much lower than the national average of 63.54 per cent. Moreover, Karnataka's state of affairs is worth noting because just few weeks back, it was being hailed as a success story in contact tracing.

Already under the scanner for alleged under-reporting of cases and fatalities, Telangana has become one of the corona hubs since June. Since June 3, when the state crossed 3,000 cases, the total number of cases has risen by 1,637 per cent. In addition, the state has one of the lowest testing rates, with just 3,37,771 people tested so far.

With testing likely togo up after multiple criticisms of the state administration's handling of the pandemic, there are also chances of cases piling up. So, Telangana witnessing a September looks like a possibility.

Kerala, however, deserves special mention. ""Kerala,you have seen now. They thought they had seen the end of COVID. Suddenly, in the last over 10 days, Kerala has had a much larger number of cases than before,"" Murthy told PTI.

Kerala was being hailed as a model state even by the WHO, which said, “The state government’s prompt response to COVID-19 can be attributed to its experience and investment made in emergency preparedness and outbreak response in the past”. However, the relaxation of the lockdown and the return of Non-Resident Keralites contributed to the rise in cases.

That Kerala has recorded over 1,000 cases thrice in the last four days, is a reminder that the virus is not going away anytime soon.

Guest workers delay peak in states

However, states like Jharkhand, Murthy said, may peak at a later time as the virus began to spread only after the return of guest workers from COVID-19 hubs like Mumbai and Delhi.

""In states like Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and parts of Eastern Uttar Pradesh, the peak will take much longer. The peak would be somewhere towards the end of September or October for those states which had low reporting earlier,"" he said.

Murthy's assessment specially holds true in the case of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh – two of India's biggest migration pools.

As noted in an earlier article, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh had very low rates of infection in comparison to their populations until April 30. That date holds a major significance in India's lockdown story because the Central government began running special trains to ferry guest workers from the next day. Consequently, the numbers of COVID-19 cases began to rise in these two states.

In terms of numbers, Bihar just had 425 confirmed cases of coronavirus on April 30. It now has 36,314 cases of coronavirus. Percentage-wise, this translates to a whopping 8,444 per cent rise in cases. Moreover, Bihar continues to lag behind in testing its population, with just 4.42 lakh tested so far.

Uttar Pradesh does not fare any better. The state has 63,742 confirmed cases of COVID-19. This figure was just 2,211 on April 30. So, there has been a 2,780 per cent rise in the total cases of coronavirus. Notably,eastern UP, economically backward and sending more migrants to West and South India, became the new cause for concern after the influx of guest workers. Varanasi, in eastern UP, is the third-biggest corona hub in UP after the Lucknow-Kanpur urban agglomeration.

Chhattisgarh is an interesting case. The state just had 40 cases on April 30 but now has nearly 7,000 cases – a massive spurt of over 17,000 per cent in less than three months. Interestingly, the state was being hailed for its effective lockdown before returning guest workers undid the gains.

Delhi to see an early peak

On Saturday, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal declared victory against the COVID-19 pandemic but said the battle is far from over. He said in the last one month, the number of coronavirus cases in Delhi has gone down,deaths have reduced, recovery rate has improved and positivity ratio has lowered.

There is truth to Kejriwal's statement. The number of coronavirus cases in June rose by 319 per cent but only by 48.27 per cent in the 25 days of July. Most likely, the growth rate will still be in two digits by the end of July, when Murthy predicts the city-state's corona cases will peak. The recovery rate, too, has improved from 66.79 per cent on June 30 to 87.29 per cent on July 25.

Thus, one may even infer that Delhi, aided by superior medical infrastructure and testing facilities, may already be in the peak stage and the coming few weeks could see a further reduction in the total number of cases.

But implicitly, Murthy may have also reinforced the notion that urban areas equipped with better infrastructure can ward off epidemics better than underdeveloped regions.

Long story in short: India has to brace for a long haul before the only peak in people’s minds will be the snow-clad Himalayan peaks.",https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/250720/covid-19-in-india-delhi-may-peak-in-a-week-but-the-south-has-to-wait.html,Covid,/Uttar:Ghaziabad,Uttar,Ghaziabad,2020-07-25 23:03:00+05:30,"Passengers with their luggage on their way to reach Howrah station and board a long route train, during the complete lockdown in the state to curb the spread of coronavirus, in Kolkata"
1,21,"The Congress Party decided to make the Rajasthan crisis a fight to the finish and said on Saturday that it would hold protests in front of the Rashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and all Raj Bhawans across the country from Monday and launch an online campaign to protest against the BJP’s “conspiracy” to topple its government in the state.

Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot said that the party might also approach President Ram Nath Kovind.

“We will sit on a dharna outside the Rashtrapati Bhavan,” Mr Gehlot said after a meeting of the state Cabinet, which had met to re-draft a proposal to governor Kalraj Mishra to call an emergency session of the state Assembly.

Mr Gehlot also indicated that the MLAs in his camp, currently at Jaipur’s Hotel Fairmont, might have to stay there for at least 21 days more.

In Delhi, a senior Congress leader told this newspaper that MPs, MLAs and all other office bearers have been told to launch an online campaign against the BJP from Sunday.

Congress workers staged demonstrations across Rajasthan, specially in Jaipur and other district headquarters, on Saturday after the Rajasthan governor refused to call an emergency Assembly session to let Mr Gehlot prove his majority on the floor of the House.

Party workers demanded that the governor convene a session of the Assembly. In Jaipur, a demonstration was held at the Youth Congress office.

“The BJP is conspiring to topple our government and the public is watching this. Efforts are also being made by invisible powers sitting in Delhi to influence the governor. People want the elected government to complete its tenure,” state Congress president Govind Singh Dotasara said, giving a call for holding the agitation.

The BJP on its part demanded the resignation of Mr Gehlot for protesting at the Raj Bhawan on Friday.

BJP leader Gulab Chand Kataria said: “We have demanded President’s Rule in the state. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot should resign for the kind of language he used Friday.”

Meanwhile, the Cabinet meeting discussed six points raised by governor Kalraj Mishra for calling an Assembly session, sources said. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said the governor has given a note to Mr Gehlot seeking clarifications. “The governor informed that he will abide by the Constitution and will take a decision without being under any pressure,” Mr Surjewala said.",https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/politics/260720/rajasthan-political-crisis-floor-test-or-we-will-protest-says-gehlot.html,Riot,/Said:Jaipur,Said,Jaipur,2020-07-26 11:35:00+05:30,The Congress Party decided to make the Rajasthan crisis a fight to the finish and said on Saturday that it would hold protests in front of the Rashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and all Raj Bhawans across the country from Monday and launch an online campaign to protest against the BJP’s “conspiracy” to topple its government in the state
2,1,"Uddhav Thackeray said he hadn't switched sides, but only entered into an alliance.

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has dared the opposition to topple his government and said though it is a ""three-wheeler"" government, he is firmly in control of its steering wheel.

Mr Thackeray, who is also president of the Shiv Sena, said his alliance partners - NCP and Congress - are ""positive"" and the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is benefitting from their experience.

He also took an aim at the Centre's ambitious Mumbai- Ahmedabad bullet train project, saying he would rather prefer such a high speed link between the state capital and Nagpur.

""The future of my government is not in the hands of the opposition. The steering is in my hands. A three-wheeler (auto-rickshaw) is a vehicle of poor people. The other two are sitting behind,"" Mr Thackeray said in the second and last part of his interview published in Shiv Sena mouthpiece ''Saamana'' on Sunday, ahead of his 60th birthday on Monday.

""Why wait for September-October as is being speculated. Topple the government right now since you get pleasure in toppling. Some people derive pleasure in constructive work while some are happy in destruction. If you feel happy in destruction, go ahead,"" he said.

""You say the MVA government is formed against the democratic principles but when you topple it, is it democracy?"" the chief minister asked.

Notably, his predecessor Devendra Fadnavis earlier compared the ruling MVA, comprising the Shiv Sena and its ideological opponents Congress and NCP, with a three-wheeler, auto-rickshaw, and raised doubts over its stability.

To a question, Mr Thackeray said he hadn't switched sides, but only entered into an alliance.

""I did this because the purpose with which I had joined hands earlier turned out to be hollow,"" he said.

Asserting that the party ideology is important, he said, ""Show me one leader who has reached the top position in the party which he has defected to. It is all use and throw policy.""

Targeting the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project, he said, ""A three-wheeler is a vehicle of poor people. If I have to choose between a bullet train and an auto-rickshaw,I will chose the auto-rickshaw. If people don't want a bullet train, then it will not happen,"" he said.

""If my government is a three-wheeler, it is moving in a proper direction, why should you have stomachache?"" he said in a veiled attack at the opposition BJP.

Mr Thackeray said when he attended the NDA meeting last time, ""there were 30 to 35 wheels like a railway train"".

The chief minister said he would scrap projects which people feel are unwanted.

He said MoUs worth Rs 16,000 crore signed recently are in initial stages and more investments are on the anvil.

""If the state requires a bullet train, I would demand a bullet train to connect Mumbai and Nagpur. I would like a bullet train which connects my state capital and the second capital. The feeling of neglect among people of Vidarbha would be wiped out. Just like the Mumbai Nagpur Samruddhi corridor, I would be happy with a bullet train,"" he said.

He also said the Congress's grievance of being neglected in the three-party alliance government was resolved after his meeting with the state Congress leaders.

""I have good coordination with (NCP chief) Sharad Pawar. I make a phone call to (Congress president) Sonia Gandhi some times,"" he said.

Mr Thackeray asserted that the tripartite MVA government was functioning well.

""I admit that in the last few months, face-to-face meetings haven't happened. One more minister is coronavirus positive now after Jitendra Awhad, Ashok Chavan and Dhananjay Munde. All ministers are in touch with each other over phone or through video conferencing,"" he said.

Mr Thackeray admitted the state's economy is not in good shape, but noted the entire world is facing such a crisis.

He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked all chief ministers not to announce any waivers or subsidies as populist measures due to which the economy would be further burdened.

In an apparent reference to his criticism over not moving out during the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr Thackeray said discussions and deliberations as well as signing of MoUs were being done by him sitting at home.

Asked about the participation of Chinese firms in investing in the state, he said more than the presence of Chinese firms in the recent MoUs, what is important is whether Chinese investments should remain in the country or not.

""During a video conference meeting with the prime minister, I had requested him to frame a national policy on doing business with China,"" he said.

Mr Thackeray also said his government had kept the MoUs with Chinese firms on hold.

""There should be a policy on whether Chinese companies should be allowed to do business in the country. If tomorrow, the situation improves and the Chinese prime minister is welcomed in India, why should we miss the business opportunities now?"" he asked.

The chief minister also rejected criticism that bureaucracy has an upper hand in his government.

""The government is the decision-maker and bureaucracy implements the decisions,"" he added.",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/maharashtra-chief-minister-uddhav-thackeray-maha-vikas-aghadi-mva-governments-steering-wheel-is-in-my-hands-2268996,Covid,/Centre:Mumbai,Centre,Mumbai,,"Uddhav Thackeray said he hadn't switched sides, but only entered into an alliance"

5,18,"Paleogenomics has amounted to a ""revolution"" in understanding disease history. (Istock)

As the novel coronavirus pandemic reshapes lives and entire economies, historians tell us this is not the first time. The earliest written records of tiny infectious organisms overhauling human societies stretch back as far as the Plague of Justinian in A.D. 541, which is thought to have killed up to 50 million people, or even the earlier Antonine Plague in A.D. 165, which left 5 million dead, a substantial portion of the world then.

Now, paleogenomics - a nascent field that studies DNA in remnants of ancient teeth - is rewriting the first chapter of humanity's entanglement with disease to thousands of years older than originally thought. The growing evidence suggests that these first epidemics forced societies to make epoch-defining transformations.

""In the case of covid-19 [the disease caused by the coronavirus], we see similar processes, but we are watching it unfold in real time,"" said Anne Stone, regents professor in the School of Human Evolution and Social Change at Arizona State University, whose focus is anthropological genetics. She also has studied evidence of tuberculosis in ancient DNA.

Paleogenomics, which adapts high-end medical tools similar to some now being used to track the coronavirus, has amounted to a ""revolution"" in understanding disease history, says Maria Spyrou, a microbiologist at the Max Planck Institute in Germany.

""This is one of the things that we can now start saying,"" said Spyrou, adding that where historical records are lacking, DNA evidence offers the possibility of filling in gaps, sometimes in surprising ways.

""One of them is plague,"" Spyrou said. ""Until 2015, we thought that plague was maybe a 3,000-year-old disease.""

Scientists and archaeologists now believe, however, that the plague bacteria, which caused the medieval Black Death that killed up to half of Europe's population, infected humans roughly 5,000 years ago in the Stone Age. The bacteria, after it had entered the bloodstream and likely killed the host, circulated into the pulp chamber of teeth, which kept its DNA insulated from millennia of environmental wear and tear. In the past decade, scientists have been able to extract and analyze that DNA.

The Stone Age plague was, however, an ancestor with a slightly different genetic identity. Tracking how those differences evolve helps infectious-disease biologists better understand what causes disease and how to prepare for current outbreaks. The plague bacteria in the Stone Age, for example, lacked the genes necessary to jump from fleas to humans, which likely spread the Black Death widely.

Without the flea gene, the disease probably used another animal transmitter that came into contact with humans. In 2018, a University of Copenhagen team published the first evidence, based on early data three years before, that the ancient plague bacteria, found in a Swedish settlement, had the power to kill and may have threatened life in the age's ""mega-settlements"" that could spread diseases quickly.

""It probably was the first pandemic,"" said Simon Rasmussen, a genomicist at the university and lead researcher on the plague study. In the Stone Age, also called the Neolithic period, humans made unprecedented moves to gather in large settlements with up to 10,000 people in close quarters with animals and virtually no sanitation. ""It's the textbook place of where you could have a new pathogen,"" he said.

Paleogenomics has also allowed archaeologists to fill in one of the biggest silences in the archaeological record: disease. Pathogens rarely leave traces on bones, and populations without writing could die out without any readable record of the cause. With the ability to read traces of DNA preserved in teeth, historians are learning about the organisms inside ancient humans.

Kristian Kristiansen, a University of Copenhagen archaeologist and a co-author of the plague study, believes his group's research illuminates the causes of a Stone Age demographic transformation, called the Neolithic decline, which archaeologists have long studied.

Settlements at the time were disappearing faster than they were appearing, and within a few hundred years, most of the population had been replaced by migrants from the Eurasian Steppe. Researchers had only ever hypothesized that disease may have played a role in crippling the native population before it was overtaken, but now they have evidence, Kristiansen says.

""The steppe migrations would not have succeeded without the plague . . . and [those living in what is now Europe] would not all have spoken Indo-European languages,"" Kristiansen said. ""Later prehistory has been turned upside down to say the least.""

In 2018, a paleogenomics team analyzed ancient teeth from Neolithic sites in present-day Germany and discovered the hepatitis B virus stretched back at least 7,000 years. Another study the same year extended our knowledge of the history of parvovirus B19 from a few hundred years to 6,900 years. Parvovirus B19 causes a mild rash in humans and leads to outbreaks in the United States every few years

In February, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology published evidence that types of Salmonella bacteria, which sicken about a million people in the United States every year, were afflicting humans 6,500 years ago. Microbiologist Felix Key identified Salmonella DNA in teeth recovered from burial sites near the Volga River in present-day Russia, where archaeological evidence has shown that humans began to abandon foraging for pastoral living. The Salmonella DNA in their teeth is the first evidence, Key says, that the adoption of this lifestyle in close contact with animals may have introduced pathogens to humans.

""This ancient DNA could give us the means to prove or disprove the hypothesis that the Neolithic revolution was the major event for introducing diseases into humans,"" said Key, who is now at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History. ""My hunch is that it did facilitate the disease, because humans and animals were co-housed.""

Like many paleogenomicists, Key uses dentist tools and dons what looks like a hazmat suit that blocks possible DNA contamination from teeth recovered from settlements thousands of years older than the Roman Empire.

New methods of extracting DNA that were developed for medical purposes have made paleogenomics possible in the past decade. After using dentist tools to recover and pulverize material locked inside a tooth, molecular biologists use a technique called ""shotgun sequencing"" to extract all genetic material without needing to know what to look for. Decrypting the data then requires that bioinformatic specialists can match the genetic identities to known pathogens. As the disease database grows, it becomes easier to identify signals from noise. Archaeologists then have the task of putting human disease into historical context.

The process is expensive, and it's dominated by labs in Europe with equipment and funding. Conducting a complete survey of teeth can cost upward of $1 million. That depends, still, on a team's good fortune in finding enough ancient teeth that have experienced the right conditions over millennia to preserve pathogen DNA. In the study of the Salmonella bacteria, Key's team analyzed 3,000 samples and found just eight with preserved Salmonella bacteria.

Rasmussen, of the Copenhagen plague study, said that, while he is fairly certain his team's evidence describes the oldest human pandemic, more DNA samples must be found and analyzed. The DNA used in his study come from just one small settlement in the area of modern-day Sweden. To prove a pandemic, Rasmussen said, scientists will need to find DNA evidence in some larger sites - in other parts of Europe.

Even so, Stone said, paleogenomics has shown that humans have been in ""an arms race with pathogens"" for thousands of years.

""Periodically, pathogens jump into humans,"" she said, ""and it's really easy to become complacent when you don't happen to have a pathogen affecting large segments of your population at the moment. But you let those resources go at your peril, which we're seeing right now.""

""Bhoomi pujan'' or the ground-breaking ceremony for the construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya is to take place on August 5.

""Let us all of us together make a spiritual effort to wish people good health and end the coronavirus epidemic. Recite ''Hanuman Chalisa'' five times a day at your home from July 25 to August 5,"" the Bhopal MP tweeted.

""Conclude this ritual by lighting lamps on August 5 and offering ''aarti'' to Lord Ram at home,"" she added.

She also shared a video on Twitter, in which she said the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh is making efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus by imposing lockdown in Bhopal till August 4.

""Though the lockdown will be over on August 4, this ritual (recitation of the Hanuman Chalisa, a hymn in praise of Lord Hanuman) will end on August 5, when ''bhoomi pujan'' for Ram temple in Ayodhya will be performed. We will celebrate that day like Diwali,"" she added.

""When people... Hindus from across the country recite the ''Hanuman Chalisa'' in one voice, it will definitely work and we will be free from coronavirus...This is your prayer to Lord Ram,"" said Thakur.

8,27,"Chief Minister Gehlot has been pressing for an assembly session, which would enable him to go for a trust vote, since Thursday, amid hearings in the Rajasthan High Court and the Supreme Court over petitions by his sacked deputy Sachin Pilot and other Congress rebels against disqualification notices.

""The BJP conspiracy will not be allowed to succeed. I will go to Rashtrapati Bhavan if needed. If we have to picket at Rashtrapati Bhavan or even Prime Minister's residence, we will give this,"" Ashok Gehlot on Saturday told Congress MLAs, who raised their hands in support.

Mr Gehlot also asked his legislators to maintain solidarity and stay strong, warning them they may have to stay in the hotel for 21 days; MLAs loyal to the Chief Minister have been sequestered at the luxurious Fairmont Hotel in Jaipur. ""The majority is with us,"" the Chief Minister said, to which the MLAs again raised their hands in support.

After their meeting with the Governor, the BJP delegation criticised the Gehlot government for stopping Mr Mishra from carrying out his constitutional duty. Addressing the media, Rajasthan BJP chief Satish Poonia said Raj Bhavan had been made a ""theatre"" and that the protesting MLAs had violated the Epidemic Act by gathering in large numbers. You cannot surround the Raj Bhavan like this, the BJP said, and called for CRPF security for Mr Mishra.

The Chief Minister and his MLAs held a five-hour sit-in at Governor Mishra's residence on Friday to press for an Assembly session on Monday. The show of strength came hours after the Sachin Pilot camp secured temporary protection from disqualification. Mr Gehlot submitted a list of 102 MLAs but the Governor raised several objections and asked Mr Gehlot to send a fresh request.

Normally a 21-day notice is required for Assembly sessions to be called, the Governor said in a statement. ""The date on which the assembly session is to be convened is not mentioned in the cabinet note and no approval has been given by the cabinet for the same,"" he said. The statement also said the state government should take note of the COVID-19 crisis and no agenda was given for a session called on such short notice. The revised proposal is believed to list the coronavirus situation as the agenda.

The Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government, which is facing a political crisis after rebellion by 19 dissident Congress MLAs, including rebel party leader Sachin Pilot, wants to hold the assembly session to prove its majority. Gehlot, 69, is going all out for a test of strength after Team Pilot scored a reprieve from the Rajasthan High Court on Friday. This means the Speaker cannot take any action against the rebels until the larger constitutional question of his powers is decided. That question will be taken up by the Supreme Court on Monday.

Mr Gehlot believes he has the numbers to retain power if he faces a trust vote now. If he does win, there cannot be any vote for the next six months. The rules say the rebels must follow the party whip in the assembly or risk being disqualified. Despite the court-ordered status quo, the rebels can be disqualified if they vote against their own party. But their vote will still count.

The Congress has a narrow lead over the opposition and is only one past the majority mark of 101 in the 200-member Rajasthan assembly. Team Pilot claims the support of 30 MLAs, but so far, the evidence points to only 19. The BJP has 72.

9,28,"Uddhav Thackeray said he hadn't switched sides, but only entered into an alliance.

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has dared the opposition to topple his government and said though it is a ""three-wheeler"" government, he is firmly in control of its steering wheel.

Mr Thackeray, who is also president of the Shiv Sena, said his alliance partners - NCP and Congress - are ""positive"" and the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is benefitting from their experience.

He also took an aim at the Centre's ambitious Mumbai- Ahmedabad bullet train project, saying he would rather prefer such a high speed link between the state capital and Nagpur.

""The future of my government is not in the hands of the opposition. The steering is in my hands. A three-wheeler (auto-rickshaw) is a vehicle of poor people. The other two are sitting behind,"" Mr Thackeray said in the second and last part of his interview published in Shiv Sena mouthpiece ''Saamana'' on Sunday, ahead of his 60th birthday on Monday.

""Why wait for September-October as is being speculated. Topple the government right now since you get pleasure in toppling. Some people derive pleasure in constructive work while some are happy in destruction. If you feel happy in destruction, go ahead,"" he said.

""You say the MVA government is formed against the democratic principles but when you topple it, is it democracy?"" the chief minister asked.

Notably, his predecessor Devendra Fadnavis earlier compared the ruling MVA, comprising the Shiv Sena and its ideological opponents Congress and NCP, with a three-wheeler, auto-rickshaw, and raised doubts over its stability.

To a question, Mr Thackeray said he hadn't switched sides, but only entered into an alliance.

""I did this because the purpose with which I had joined hands earlier turned out to be hollow,"" he said.

Asserting that the party ideology is important, he said, ""Show me one leader who has reached the top position in the party which he has defected to. It is all use and throw policy.""

Targeting the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project, he said, ""A three-wheeler is a vehicle of poor people. If I have to choose between a bullet train and an auto-rickshaw,I will chose the auto-rickshaw. If people don't want a bullet train, then it will not happen,"" he said.

""If my government is a three-wheeler, it is moving in a proper direction, why should you have stomachache?"" he said in a veiled attack at the opposition BJP.

Mr Thackeray said when he attended the NDA meeting last time, ""there were 30 to 35 wheels like a railway train"".

The chief minister said he would scrap projects which people feel are unwanted.

He said MoUs worth Rs 16,000 crore signed recently are in initial stages and more investments are on the anvil.

""If the state requires a bullet train, I would demand a bullet train to connect Mumbai and Nagpur. I would like a bullet train which connects my state capital and the second capital. The feeling of neglect among people of Vidarbha would be wiped out. Just like the Mumbai Nagpur Samruddhi corridor, I would be happy with a bullet train,"" he said.

He also said the Congress's grievance of being neglected in the three-party alliance government was resolved after his meeting with the state Congress leaders.

""I have good coordination with (NCP chief) Sharad Pawar. I make a phone call to (Congress president) Sonia Gandhi some times,"" he said.

Mr Thackeray asserted that the tripartite MVA government was functioning well.

""I admit that in the last few months, face-to-face meetings haven't happened. One more minister is coronavirus positive now after Jitendra Awhad, Ashok Chavan and Dhananjay Munde. All ministers are in touch with each other over phone or through video conferencing,"" he said.

Mr Thackeray admitted the state's economy is not in good shape, but noted the entire world is facing such a crisis.

He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked all chief ministers not to announce any waivers or subsidies as populist measures due to which the economy would be further burdened.

In an apparent reference to his criticism over not moving out during the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr Thackeray said discussions and deliberations as well as signing of MoUs were being done by him sitting at home.

Asked about the participation of Chinese firms in investing in the state, he said more than the presence of Chinese firms in the recent MoUs, what is important is whether Chinese investments should remain in the country or not.

""During a video conference meeting with the prime minister, I had requested him to frame a national policy on doing business with China,"" he said.

Mr Thackeray also said his government had kept the MoUs with Chinese firms on hold.

""There should be a policy on whether Chinese companies should be allowed to do business in the country. If tomorrow, the situation improves and the Chinese prime minister is welcomed in India, why should we miss the business opportunities now?"" he asked.

The chief minister also rejected criticism that bureaucracy has an upper hand in his government.

Diesel price in the national capital on Sunday inched towards the Rs 82 per litre-mark following the second consecutive day of price hike.

Diesel price was increased by 15 paise per litre, according to a price notification of state-owned oil marketing companies.

This took the retail selling price in the national capital to the highest ever rate of Rs 81.94 per litre.

Rates vary from state to state depending on the incidence of local sales tax or VAT.

This is the second consecutive day of price increase. Rates were hiked by 15 paise on Saturday. The price increase on Saturday came after a four-day hiatus in rate revision.

Petrol prices on Sunday remained unchanged. Prices of petrol have remained static at Rs 80.43 per litre for almost four weeks. Petrol rates were last changed on June 29.

Prior to hitting the freeze button, petrol price had been increased on 21 occasions since the oil companies reverted to daily price revision on June 7. The cumulative increase in petrol came to Rs 9.17 per litre.

Diesel rates have continued to be revised sporadically in July. The cumulative increase in diesel price since June 7 now totals Rs 12.55 per litre.

In Mumbai, petrol is priced at Rs 87.19 -- unchanged since June 29, while diesel now costs Rs 80.11 a litre.

Prior to June 7, oil companies had for 82 days not revised petrol and diesel prices as they adjusted a record increase in excise duty by the government against the fall in rates warranted due to international oil prices slumping to a two-year low.

Commenting on oil prices, ICICI Securities said sharp recovery in oil price from lows in April was driven by fall in global supply surplus from 22.7 million barrels per day (bpd) to demand-supply balance in June.

“Global oil supply in June fell by 13.7 million bpd from April levels, while demand recovered by 9.1 million bpd during the same period as per IEA. Falling supply and recovery in demand led to demand-supply balance in June vs supply surplus of 22.7 million bpd in April,” it said.

It said lockdowns due to the second wave of infections have hurt demand recovery in the US and India.

As per EIA data, total US, gasoline and diesel demand decline was steeper in the week ended July 17 than in the preceding 4-6 weeks.

“If my government is a three-wheeler, it is moving in a proper direction, why should you have stomachache?” he said in a veiled attack at the opposition BJP.

Thackeray said when he attended the NDA meeting last time, “there were 30 to 35 wheels like a railway train”.

The chief minister said he would scrap projects which people feel are unwanted.

He said MoUs worth Rs 16,000 crore signed recently are in initial stages and more investments are on the anvil.

“If the state requires a bullet train, I would demand a bullet train to connect Mumbai and Nagpur. I would like a bullet train which connects my state capital and the second capital. The feeling of neglect among people of Vidarbha would be wiped out. Just like the Mumbai Nagpur Samruddhi corridor, I would be happy with a bullet train,” he said.

He also said the Congress’s grievance of being neglected in the three-party alliance government was resolved after his meeting with the state Congress leaders.

“I have good coordination with (NCP chief) Sharad Pawar. I make a phone call to (Congress president) Sonia Gandhi some times,” he said.

Thackeray asserted that the tripartite MVA government was functioning well.

“I admit that in the last few months, face-to-face meetings haven’t happened. One more minister is coronavirus positive now after Jitendra Awhad, Ashok Chavan and Dhananjay Munde. All ministers are in touch with each other over phone or through video conferencing,” he said.

Thackeray admitted the state’s economy is not in good shape, but noted the entire world is facing such a crisis.

He said Prime MinisterNarendra Modi has asked all chief ministers not to announce any waivers or subsidies as populist measures due to which the economy would be further burdened.

In an apparent reference to his criticism over not moving out during the COVID-19 pandemic, Thackeray said discussions and deliberations as well as signing of MoUs were being done by him sitting at home.

Asked about the participation of Chinese firms in investing in the state, he said more than the presence of Chinese firms in the recent MoUs, what is important is whether Chinese investments should remain in the country or not.

“During a video conference meeting with the prime minister, I had requested him to frame a national policy on doing business with China,” he said.

Thackeray also said his government had kept the MoUs with Chinese firms on hold.

“There should be a policy on whether Chinese companies should be allowed to do business in the country. If tomorrow, the situation improves and the Chinese prime minister is welcomed in India, why should we miss the business opportunities now?” he asked.

President Xi Jinping’s strategy to expand its territorial dispute with Bhutan to needle India appears to have brought the tiny kingdom nestled in the Himalayas closer to New Delhi. Thimphu, which had last found itself caught in the crossfire between India and China during the 2017 Doklam standoff appeared to have had second thoughts about its proximity to India vis-a-vis China, people familiar with the developments told Hindustan Times.

There was lately, an emerging view in Bhutan, wedged geographically between India and China, that the kingdom should perhaps balance its ties with its two neighbours so that Thimphu isn’t squeezed between the giants again. “It was never spelt out in black and white but this view was gaining ground over the last two-three years,” people in New Delhi and Thimphu said.

But there has been a change in Thimpu’s approach over the last one month after Beijing stunned Bhutan at the June meeting of the US-based multinational fund, Global Environment Facility, when Thimphu was seeking funds for the Sakteng wildlife sanctuary. The Chinese representative objected, claiming that there was a dispute between China and Bhutan over part of the sanctuary spread across 650 sq km.

The Chinese move to make new territorial claims in Bhutan has convinced Thimpu that it should not hang to any hopes that its northern neighbour, 250 times bigger, would be fair. That if it cedes any ground to appease Beijing, it would only end up fueling its territorial ambitions, the people mentioned above said.

Thimphu formally protested the China claim, issuing a demarche to the Chinese mission in Delhi. Bhutan and Beijing use their missions in Delhi to communicate. It also issued a rare statement earlier this month, underlining that disputes relating to the undemarcated border would be discussed at the next round of border talks.

Bhutan and China have held 24 rounds of talks since 1984 to settle their border issue, the last in 2016. Beijing has been pressuring Bhutan to accept a package deal for nearly 20 years that would let it take over Bhutanese territory of Doklam, Sinchulung, Dramana, and Shakhatoe spread across 269 sq km in the western sector. In exchange, China would give up its claim over Bhutan’s Pasamlung and Jakarlung valleys in the north.

China’s claim over the nature preserve spread across 650 sq km in eastern Bhutan’s Trashigang district almost doubles the area of the disputed territories between the two countries from the existing 764 sq km.

Bhutan is yet to decide on an Indian proposal to build a road through the sanctuary that would sharply reduce the 450 km long distance between Guwahati and Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh by one-third. New Delhi is expected to take up the proposal with Thimphu as part of India’s hard push to border infrastructure.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-tried-to-jab-india-with-a-new-claim-on-bhutan-why-it-has-boomeranged/story-rqplyG6gdbN7eOs3X1FInM.html,Riot,/Updated:Ghaziabad,Updated,Ghaziabad,2020-07-26 07:44:08+05:30,"india Updated: Jul 26, 2020 07:44 IST President Xi Jinping’s strategy to expand its territorial dispute with Bhutan to needle India appears to have brought the tiny kingdom nestled in the Himalayas closer to New Delhi"

“At such a time, I would urge you that whenever you feel troubled because of the mask and feel like removing it, then, for a moment, remember those doctors, nurses and corona warriors,” he said.

“They keep wearing masks continuously for hours and are working to save everyone’s lives. They keep wearing the mask for eight to ten hours. Aren’t they troubled?” he asked.

Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has dared the opposition to topple his government and said though it is a “three-wheeler” government, he is firmly in control of its steering wheel.

Thackeray, who is also president of the Shiv Sena, said his alliance partners - NCP and Congress - are “positive” and the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is benefitting from their experience.

He also took an aim at the Centre’s ambitious Mumbai- Ahmedabad bullet train project, saying he would rather prefer such a high speed link between the state capital and Nagpur.

“The future of my government is not in the hands of the opposition. The steering is in my hands. A three-wheeler (auto-rickshaw) is a vehicle of poor people. The other two are sitting behind,” Thackeray said in the second and last part of his interview published in Shiv Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ on Sunday, ahead of his 60th birthday on Monday.

“Why wait for September-October as is being speculated. Topple the government right now since you get pleasure in toppling. Some people derive pleasure in constructive work while some are happy in destruction. If you feel happy in destruction, go ahead,” he said.

“You say the MVA government is formed against the democratic principles but when you topple it, is it democracy?” the chief minister asked.

Notably, his predecessor Devendra Fadnavis earlier compared the ruling MVA, comprising the Shiv Sena and its ideological opponents Congress and NCP, with a three-wheeler, auto-rickshaw, and raised doubts over its stability.

To a question, Thackeray said he hadn’t switched sides, but only entered into an alliance.

“I did this because the purpose with which I had joined hands earlier turned out to be hollow,” he said.

Asserting that the party ideology is important, he said, “Show me one leader who has reached the top position in the party which he has defected to. It is all use and throw policy.” Targeting the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project, he said, “A three-wheeler is a vehicle of poor people. If I have to choose between a bullet train and an auto-rickshaw,I will chose the auto-rickshaw. If people don’t want a bullet train, then it will not happen,” he said.

“If my government is a three-wheeler, it is moving in a proper direction, why should you have stomachache?” he said in a veiled attack at the opposition BJP.

Thackeray said when he attended the NDA meeting last time, “there were 30 to 35 wheels like a railway train”.

The chief minister said he would scrap projects which people feel are unwanted.

He said MoUs worth Rs 16,000 crore signed recently are in initial stages and more investments are on the anvil.

“If the state requires a bullet train, I would demand a bullet train to connect Mumbai and Nagpur. I would like a bullet train which connects my state capital and the second capital. The feeling of neglect among people of Vidarbha would be wiped out. Just like the Mumbai Nagpur Samruddhi corridor, I would be happy with a bullet train,” he said.

He also said the Congress’s grievance of being neglected in the three-party alliance government was resolved after his meeting with the state Congress leaders.

“I have good coordination with (NCP chief) Sharad Pawar. I make a phone call to (Congress president) Sonia Gandhi some times,” he said.

Thackeray asserted that the tripartite MVA government was functioning well.

“I admit that in the last few months, face-to-face meetings haven’t happened. One more minister is coronavirus positive now after Jitendra Awhad, Ashok Chavan and Dhananjay Munde. All ministers are in touch with each other over phone or through video conferencing,” he said.

Thackeray admitted the state’s economy is not in good shape, but noted the entire world is facing such a crisis.

He said Prime MinisterNarendra Modi has asked all chief ministers not to announce any waivers or subsidies as populist measures due to which the economy would be further burdened.

In an apparent reference to his criticism over not moving out during the COVID-19 pandemic, Thackeray said discussions and deliberations as well as signing of MoUs were being done by him sitting at home.

Asked about the participation of Chinese firms in investing in the state, he said more than the presence of Chinese firms in the recent MoUs, what is important is whether Chinese investments should remain in the country or not.

The Kissing Booth 2

Director: Vince Marcello

Cast: Joey King, Jacob Elordi, Joel Courtney, Taylor Zakhar Perez

Lara Jean may have been able to resist the charms of a second hot boy in her life but Elle Evans may not be made of such stern stuff. The Kissing Booth 2 presents a similar dilemma to its nerdy American high schooler lead, as earlier this year’s To All The Boys: PS I Love You—falling for another unearthly cute guy when you already have an unearthly cute guy in your arms. However, The Kissing Booth 2 is not as stylish or even half as heartfelt, making it just a quarter as enjoyable.

Watch the trailer for The Kissing Booth 2:

Set in the fantastical, faraway land of Netflix high school romcoms where one regularly gets the option to choose between two perfect specimens of human males, The Kissing Booth 2 is unable to find a true calling, purpose or justification for a sequel. It sits at a bloated runtime of 130 minutes and to while it away, it employs any and every conflict possible. There’re jealous girlfriends, annoying best friends, lying boys, seduced girls, fear of the future, a dance competition, adultery, self doubt, the uncaring way of life, forbidden love, and the belief in the existence of soulmates. But much like that inedible broth, too many conflicts also spoil what could have been a slick high school comedy.

This time, Elle (Joey King) must navigate life through senior year at her sunny California school after her boyfriend Noah (Jacob Elordi) leaves for Harvard. They decide to give long distance relationship a chance, a promise that is not helped by the arrival of a dashing new admission at school, Marco (Taylor Zakhar Perez). With his curls, sweaty gym videos and guitar, he soon makes long distance celibacy a tough task for Elle, who is already turned into the doubting girlfriend, jealous of Noah’s gorgeous new friend at college, Chloe (Maisie Richardson).

Any other high school movie would have perhaps been content with so much on their plate but not this one. This love-quadrangle is only in addition to the conflict brewing between Elle, her best friend Lee (Joel Courtney) and his frankly frustrated girlfriend Rachel. While Elle and Lee’s friendship, their Dance Dance Revolution sessions and the easy, electric chemistry between Joey and Joel make for some of the best things about the film, Rachel is not so cool with Elle third-wheeling them all the time. If the break-ups and the proclamations of the core group were too much to keep track of, this only adds to the chaos.

Even with constant voice-overs about her feelings and learnings—Elle is writing her letters of applications to various colleges throughout the film—it still gets confusing to keep up with her many musings and motivations. The film is incredibly stretched. A scene in the beginning, about a ‘comedic’ disaster with the school announcement system, drags on for a torturous minute. There is very little humour about it and even less so when it plays out with that chaotic, Disney Channel energy.

The jealous girlfriend plot also takes multiple revisits to finally establish the excuse to dump the past and move on to a guitar-strumming, curly haired future. And frankly, Joey and Jacob’s negligible amount of scenes together—the secret, forbidden romance from the first part replaced by Skype calls and unread texts—makes it hard to root for ‘Elno’ anyway.

But The Kissing Booth 2 is not without its moments of genuine goodness. Taylor’s charming powers can be felt through your screens even as he woos Elle on the DDM machine or plays her a sweet song at the beach, talking about how he would treat her right. Their electric scenes make you second guess the validity of Elle and Noah’s long confessions of love and maybe, just this once, you’d have let the heroine break up with Colin Firth for Hugh Grant.

A third love story—about a boy finding the courage to come out to his school, confess his love for a genius dork—also brings sweet respite from Elle and her many troubles. The ending of the film, even though rushed, feels almost acceptable just for the sake of these two.

The Kissing Booth 2 ( Marcos Cruz/Netflix )

Joey is still a good fit for Elle. She can be convincingly excited about Halloween costumes and also heartbroken over a cheating boyfriend. Jacob, however, appeared to have checked out of that Zoom call a while ago.

With its bubblegum filters, school kids in convertibles on a sunny street and mediocre essays being deemed fit for a Harvard acceptance letter, there is much that separates The Kissing Booth 2 from reality. Which is why it is quite the right specimen of the high school romantic comedy section of Netflix.

Sourav Ganguly has built his reputation for not just being a great cricketer but also an able leader. He was the captain of Team India in the early 2000s and is credited with transforming the fortunes of the side with his fearless leadership. After his retirement, Ganguly gradually shifted his focus towards administration. He first became the president of the Bengal Cricket Association and worked to improve the state of cricket in the region.

Then last year, Ganguly was unanimously elected as the President of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). However, Ganguly’s name has also started doing the rounds for the vacant post of ICC Chairman. Shashank Manohar stepped down from the post recently and several cricketers have backed Ganguly to become the next ICC Chairman.

READ | Sourav Ganguly tests negative for Covid-19

Sri Lankan cricket great Kumar Sangakkara also weighed in on the subject and said that Ganguly is a suitable candidate for the post due to his astute cricket brain.

“I think Sourav definitely can make that change. Quite a big fan of Dada not just because of his stature as a cricketer but I think he has a very astute cricket brain. He has the best interests of the game at heart and that should not change just because you are the BCCI president or the ECB or SLC or any other cricket board when you are at the ICC.

“Your mindset should be truly international and not just constrained by partisanship in terms of where I come from -- am I Indian, Sri Lankan or Australia or English but really understand ‘yes I am a cricketer and what I am doing is what is best for all cricketing countries,” Kumar Sangakkara told India Today.

“Most importantly, the foundation of this game is children, fans, and spectators around the world. I think Sourav can do that very, very well. I have seen his work even before he took over as the BCCI president, even before administration and coaching, and how he has built relationships with players around the world, his standing in the MCC cricket committee. I have no doubt that Sourav will be a very, very suitable candidate to do just that,” Kumar Sangakkara asserted.

Cricket South Africa (CSA) director of Cricket Graeme Smith also wants Sourav Ganguly to take over ICC chairmanship in this tough period for cricket. Smith’s comments were backed by CSA CEO Jacques Faul, who also said that South Africa won’t have any objection to an Indian again heading the ICC.

“From our perspective, it would be great to see a cricket man like Sourav Ganguly maybe getting into the President’s role of the ICC,” Smith told reporters.

“I think that will be good for the game; I think it will be good for the modern game as well. He understands it; he has played it at the highest level; he is respected; and his leadership will be key to us going forward,” Smith, the former Proteas skipper said.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/sourav-definitely-can-make-that-change-kumar-sangakkara-believes-ganguly-is-a-very-suitable-candidate-for-icc-president/story-XRJUkzIIsbMvsj2mB6NwxH.html,Covid,/Updated:Ghaziabad,Updated,Ghaziabad,2020-07-26 07:55:28+05:30,"cricket Updated: Jul 26, 2020 10:56 IST Sourav Ganguly has built his reputation for not just being a great cricketer but also an able leader"

There was lately, an emerging view in Bhutan, wedged geographically between India and China, that the kingdom should perhaps balance its ties with its two neighbours so that Thimphu isn’t squeezed between the giants again. “It was never spelt out in black and white but this view was gaining ground over the last two-three years,” people in New Delhi and Thimphu said.

But there has been a change in Thimpu’s approach over the last one month after Beijing stunned Bhutan at the June meeting of the US-based multinational fund, Global Environment Facility, when Thimphu was seeking funds for the Sakteng wildlife sanctuary. The Chinese representative objected, claiming that there was a dispute between China and Bhutan over part of the sanctuary spread across 650 sq km.

The Chinese move to make new territorial claims in Bhutan has convinced Thimpu that it should not hang to any hopes that its northern neighbour, 250 times bigger, would be fair. That if it cedes any ground to appease Beijing, it would only end up fueling its territorial ambitions, the people mentioned above said.

Thimphu formally protested the China claim, issuing a demarche to the Chinese mission in Delhi. Bhutan and Beijing use their missions in Delhi to communicate. It also issued a rare statement earlier this month, underlining that disputes relating to the undemarcated border would be discussed at the next round of border talks.

Bhutan and China have held 24 rounds of talks since 1984 to settle their border issue, the last in 2016. Beijing has been pressuring Bhutan to accept a package deal for nearly 20 years that would let it take over Bhutanese territory of Doklam, Sinchulung, Dramana, and Shakhatoe spread across 269 sq km in the western sector. In exchange, China would give up its claim over Bhutan’s Pasamlung and Jakarlung valleys in the north.

China’s claim over the nature preserve spread across 650 sq km in eastern Bhutan’s Trashigang district almost doubles the area of the disputed territories between the two countries from the existing 764 sq km.

Bhutan is yet to decide on an Indian proposal to build a road through the sanctuary that would sharply reduce the 450 km long distance between Guwahati and Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh by one-third. New Delhi is expected to take up the proposal with Thimphu as part of India’s hard push to border infrastructure.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-tried-to-jab-india-with-a-new-claim-on-bhutan-why-it-has-boomeranged/story-rqplyG6gdbN7eOs3X1FInM.html,Riot,/Updated:Ghaziabad,Updated,Ghaziabad,2020-07-26 07:44:08+05:30,"india Updated: Jul 26, 2020 07:44 IST President Xi Jinping’s strategy to expand its territorial dispute with Bhutan to needle India appears to have brought the tiny kingdom nestled in the Himalayas closer to New Delhi"

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday urged people to remain vigilant and renewed his pitch for precautionary measures in the war against the coronavirus pandemic as he reminded them of those fighting on the frontline.

Addressing the 67th edition of his monthly radio programme Mann Ki Baat, PM Modi hailed the declining Covid-19 fatality rate and increasing recovery rate and at the same time emphasised that the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) continues to be lethal.

“We have been able to save the lives of lakhs of people but the threat of coronavirus is not over yet. It is spreading fast in many areas and we need to remain vigilant,” he said.

PM Modi said people have to continue wearing masks, keep a distance of two yards, wash hands continuously, not spit anywhere and take full care of cleanliness as these are the weapons that can protect us against the coronavirus disease.

He said people sometimes have trouble with the mask, feel like removing them and start talking to others.

“At such a time, I would urge you that whenever you feel troubled because of the mask and feel like removing it, then, for a moment, remember those doctors, nurses and corona warriors,” he said.

“They keep wearing masks continuously for hours and are working to save everyone’s lives. They keep wearing the mask for eight to ten hours. Aren’t they troubled?” he asked.

India reported 48,661 new cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and 705 deaths in the last 24 hours, taking its tally to 1,385,522, Union health minister data showed on Sunday.

India is observing Kargil Vijay Diwas on Sunday to commemorate its victory over Pakistan in the high-altitude conflict in Jammu and Kashmir’s Kargil district and along the Line of Control (LoC) and pay tributes to soldiers who lost their lives more than two decades ago.

India launched Operation Vijay to clear the posts in the Kargil sector, which was occupied by the Pakistani soldiers and infiltrators on the Indian side of the LoC.

The armies of the nuclear-armed nations fought the war between May and July in 1999.

The Indian Army, with the help of the Indian Air Force (IAF), wrested back the glaciated heights of Kargil, in the Ladakh sector, from the Pakistan army.

The Kargil War, which lasted a little over two months and ended on July 26, 1999, led to 527 deaths on India’s side.

Here are some facts about the Kargil War:

* India and Pakistan fought the Kargil War between May and July of 1999 in Kargil district under the temperature of minus 10 degree Celsius.

* The conflict began after Indian forces detected infiltrations by Pakistani troops and terrorists into Indian territory. The Pakistani side had a strategic advantage during the start of the conflict as they positioned themselves in key locations and could fire at advancing Indian troops.

* The Indian Army was able to ascertain the points of incursion based on information from local shepherds and launched Operation Vijay.

* IAF’s launched its air operations under Operation Safed Sagar in support of the army on May 26. Indian MiG-21, MiG-27 and Mirage-2000 fighters fired rockets and missiles throughout the Kargil War at the “fortified enemy positions” from their side of LoC.

* IAF had planned to bomb targets in Pakistan during the Kargil War. But the then National Democratic Alliance or NDA government led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee instructed the then IAF chief air chief marshal AY Tipnis that his fighter jets must not cross LoC under any circumstances.

* IAF also wanted to cross the LoC slightly during the Kargil War but this request was also rejected by the government.

* Pakistan shot down two Indian fighter jets while another crashed during the operation.

* The Indian Navy also launched Operation Talwar to blockade Pakistani ports, especially the one in Karachi, during the Kargil War to stop the supply of oil and fuel.

* The Indian Navy’s western and eastern fleets patrolled the Arabian Sea and threatened to cut Pakistan’s trade routes.

* Pakistan asked the US to intervene but then American president Bill Clinton declined its request, saying Islamabad must withdraw its troops from LoC.

* Indian armed forces attacked the rest of the outposts as Pakistani troops withdrew and captured the last of them by July 26.

* The official death toll on the Indian side was 527 and that on the Pakistani side was between 357 and 453.

* Pakistan had initially denied it had any role in the conflict and said that India was facing off with “Kashmiri freedom fighters.” It, however, awarded its soldiers medals for the conflict later.

* After the Kargil War, India increased its defence spending in the budget.

* The complete overhaul of India’s intelligence set-up and the creation of a younger and fitter army are among the most significant changes made by the government on the basis of recommendations of the Kargil Review Committee (KRC).

* The creation of the post of a Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) was also among them. General Bipin Rawat took over as the first CDS on January 1 this year and will serve a full three-year term till December 2022.

* The creation of the Defence Intelligence Agency in 2002 and the technical intelligence gathering agency, National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) in 2004, were some of the report’s key outcomes.

* The timespan for promotions was slashed up to the rank of commanding officers (COs) or colonels and their equivalent in the air force and navy.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kargil-vijay-diwas-day-to-mark-india-s-victory-in-1999-conflict-against-pakistan/story-x2cUNDgKxoQPxrzKEmoK4J.html,Covid,/Updated:Ghaziabad,Updated,Ghaziabad,2020-07-26 11:34:42+05:30,"india Updated: Jul 26, 2020 11:38 IST India is observing Kargil Vijay Diwas on Sunday to commemorate its victory over Pakistan in the high-altitude conflict in Jammu and Kashmir’s Kargil district and along the Line of Control (LoC) and pay tributes to soldiers who lost their lives more than two decades ago"

Multistate outbreak of Cyclospora, an infection linked to consumption of bagged salads, has infected over 600 people in the United States. According to federal officials, the infection is linked to recalled batches of salad mixes by Fresh Express production facility located in Illinois.

The salads mixes contained red cabbage, iceberg lettuce and carrots and other products by Fresh Express. The first few cases of infections were reported between May and this month across 11 US states including Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Wisconsin.

“The FDA, along with CDC and state and local partners continue to investigate a multistate outbreak of Cyclospora infections potentially linked to salad products that were made by Fresh Express containing iceberg lettuce, red cabbage, and carrots and that were sold in several regions of the United States. The investigation includes Fresh Express branded products as well as products made by Fresh Express for retail store brands sold at ALDI, Giant Eagle, Hy-Vee, Jewel-Osco, ShopRite, and Walmart. Investigators continue to look into whether other retail brands may be impacted,” the FDA said in a release.

The US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) has urged people to steer clear of salads.

“Consumers should not eat, and restaurants and retailers should not sell or serve any of the recalled products. These products may either be branded with the Fresh Express label, or they may be branded with a number of retail store brand labels. The recalled retail store brands are ALDI Little Salad Bar, Giant Eagle, Hy-Vee, Jewel-Osco Signature Farms, ShopRite Wholesome Pantry, and Walmart Marketside,” the FDA stated.

Cyclospora, a microscopic parasite, affects the intestinal tract and causes diarrhoea that can last for over a month. A person may start showing the symptoms nearly a week after consuming contaminated food or water.

""Today is July 26th and it is a very special day - Kargil Vijay Diwas. 21 years ago our brave soldiers raised the flag of victory in Kargil,"" the Prime Minister said.

""Nobody can forget the way the Kargil war got underway, when Pakistan, to distract attention from its own domestic issues, provoked a war.""

""This happened at a time when India was trying to work for peace between the two countries. But the Indian army combated all this and we got a victory as the world watched in wonder,"" Mr. Modi said.

""I too had, at that time, the good fortune of visiting Kargil. I pay homage not only to our martyrs, but also the brave mothers who gave birth to these brave sons,"" he said.

Mr. Modi said the information of all gallantry award winners of the country is collated and can be accessed at www.galantryawards.gov.in

Reflecting on the words of former Prime Minister and BJP leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Mr. Modi said: ""What Atalji said from the ramparts of the Red Fort is still memorable today. He spoke of Mahatma Gandhi's talisman of thinking about your actions and how it will affect the life of the most opressed.""

Atalji added another bit to this talisman: ""Before any action think whether it would add to the honour and respect of those who laid down their lives for the country,"" he said.

The Prime Minister asked the citizens to be more mindful of the honour of the soldiers posted in the border areas.

""Friends, all we say is that a war-like situation affects the morale of those posted at the borders. We must never forget this and be mindful that whatever we do and say should only add to the honour of our soldiers,"" he said.

""Sometimes we post things on social media or forward things on phones without fully understanding that it hurts the morale of the people. Wars are not just fought on the borders. We have to decide which role we want to play,"" Mr. Modi added.

'Inspirational work'

The rural areas of our country has paved the way forward, Mr. Modi said.

""We are in the midst of a crisis but people have also faced it with great fortitude and that is what converts crisis into opportunity,"" the Prime Minister said.

""Our rural areas have shown the way during the Corona crisis. For example in Jammu, Balbir Kaur set up a 30 bed Corona centre and also carried a spray tank on her shoulders to undertake sanitisation,"" he added.

""Ganderbal's Jaituna Begum who distributed free masks and rations in her area. She also distributed saplings of apple. Mohammed Iqbal of Anantnag made a low cost sprayer for ₹50,000. We hear of such inspirational work everyday,"" he said.

""In Bihar, women SHGs have started making masks our of fabric with Madhubani paintings. Craftsmen in Tripura and Manipur have made water bottles and tiffin boxes from bamboo... these are hardy, and being boiled in Neem before hand, these are also hydgienic."" the PM said.

Speaking of innovations that arose out of necessities, Mr. Modi referred to the examples of Ladakh, Kutch and Bihar.

""In Bihar a group of boys decided to cultivate pearls. They have now expanded to Muzzaffarpur, Begusarai and Patna, where people have returned home from other parts of the country,"" he said.

In Ladakh, the supply chains of apricot - a fruit that has the capacity to transform the economy of the area - are problematic. The innovation of a solar drier, a new machine that dries out the the fruit hygienically and without wastage has benefited them, he added.

""In Kutch, dragon fruit is being grown in an innovative manner,"" Mr. Modi said.

""When we think of some thing new and innovative, then impossible things become possible."" The PM remarked.

'Must keep up precautions'

""The way the country has fought corona in the last few months that has allayed many fears. Our recovery rate is one of the highest and our death toll is also low but every life is precious,"" Mr. Modi said.

""We still need to observe all precautions and be mindful that Corona is as grievous as it was- wearing masks, maintaining hygiene, keeping physical distance are all important,"" he said.

33,7,"The story so far: To estimate the extent of infection in the community, scientists at the National Centre for Disease Control (formerly National Institute for Communicable Diseases), a Health Ministry body tasked with monitoring epidemics, conducted a district-wise serological survey across Delhi from June 27 to July 10. Preliminary findings showed that 23.48% of Delhi’s population had been exposed to the virus and that a large number of those infected were asymptomatic.

How was the Delhi sero-prevalence survey done?

Unlike the real time RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) tests or antigen tests that scan for the presence of the coronavirus in the body, the sero-prevalence survey was designed to look for the presence of antibodies, produced in response to the coronavirus, in the blood. On an average, antibodies can be detected five days after an infection sets in. The coronavirus, in general, diminishes after 21 days. Antibodies, for a host of other viral infections, are normally expected to linger for many months and confer protection against fresh infections by the same virus. However, it is still too early in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 to know how long the antibodies will last.

Also read | Delhi’s COVID-19 sero-prevalence study: significant proportion of population still vulnerable

According to health experts, because the actual virus withers away quickly, many of those infected show mild symptoms. Antigen and PCR tests are often cumbersome to be widely deployed in the field and are not always the best way to estimate the spread of the virus. After the Indian Council of Medical Research led a multi-institutional study in May to estimate national sero-prevalence using the Kavach-ELISA antibody-detection kit, developed and tested in India, the government decided to do a similar study across Delhi. In June, the city was grappling with a high number of cases and several parts of the city were locked into containment zones.

What did the survey find?

Nearly 22,000 samples were collected from 11 districts. It emerged that on average, 23.48% of Delhi had been exposed to the virus. A large number of those infected were asymptomatic. Like in all statistical surveys, extrapolating the results from a sliver of a population to an entire city comes with its own caveats. Generally, those who commission such surveys report their findings in a peer-reviewed journal and detail, for instance, how accurate the test was in picking up infections and the error margins in extrapolating the results to a population. No such details were made available, so the announcement that nearly a quarter of Delhi’s 20 million population had been exposed to the virus is at best only suggestive.

A lot of the samples were collected from Delhi’s densest pockets so the extent of variation of infection in less populated parts of Delhi is not known. The Delhi government has said it will keep repeating these surveys at periodic intervals to gauge the spread of the infection. The survey found that nearly eight of the 11 districts had a sero-prevalence exceeding 20%. To the Delhi government, the fact that after six months of the global pandemic there was a 23% spread was indicative of the effect of lockdown and containment zone management. But the government also cautioned that the survey showed 77% of the population to be vulnerable to the infection; therefore, measures such as masks, hygiene, social distancing ought to be strictly adhered to.

Also read | Survey on antibodies against COVID-19 to be conducted every month: Delhi Health Minister

Another way to look at serology surveys is to compare the number of RT-PCR positive cases and the number of those who were infected as per their antibody profiles. Thus assuming that 50 lakh (or 25% as per this survey) were infected and comparing that to only about 100,000 who were confirmed positive, it appears that a PCR test caught only about 1 in 50 who are infected by the virus. This undermines claims by the Delhi government of its ability to contain infection spread. However, missing a sizeable proportion of those infected by the coronavirus is par for the course given that it spreads rapidly and leaves a large proportion of those afflicted with only mild (and frequently unreported) symptoms.

How reliable are serology surveys?

While it is routine in epidemiology to deploy antibody tests to estimate the prevalence of a disease, the sheer speed of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the global nature of the disease have complicated the matter. Generally, they take a while to develop and are tested in the field before being deployed in large numbers. This is done to rule out errors such as the test marking the wrong antibodies, or an inappropriate sample that does not represent a population being chosen. Such problems hindered an early plan by the ICMR to use China-manufactured antibody kits in April and May to gauge infection spread. The ICMR is still to publish details of its May serosurvey that estimated 0.73% of the population in 63 surveyed districts to be infected. For COVID-19, the reliability of such surveys still rests on nascent science.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/the-hindu-explains-what-are-the-implications-of-the-delhi-sero-survey-findings/article32192834.ece,Covid,/Centre:Mumbai,Centre,Mumbai,,"The story so far: To estimate the extent of infection in the community, scientists at the National Centre for Disease Control (formerly National Institute for Communicable Diseases), a Health Ministry body tasked with monitoring epidemics, conducted a district-wise serological survey across Delhi from June 27 to July 10"

Citing previous Supreme Court rulings on the matter, the Gehlot cabinet is believed to have said the Government can neither question the period of convening an Assembly session, fix the procedures for the conduct of the session nor can it the agenda.

“The Cabinet met at 4 p.m. again and conveyed these points to the Raj Bhavan. We will wait for his response as we don’t want to escalate things,” a senior Congress leader said.

Mr Gehlot along with the MLAs supporting him had staged a five-hour-long sit-in on the lawns of Raj Bhavan here on Friday.

While accusing the Governor of stalling a decision on summoning the House session under “pressure from above”, Mr. Gehlot had said the people from the entire State could lay siege to Raj Bhavan. The Chief Minister wants to prove his majority with the hope to end the political uncertainty created after the rebellion of Sachin Pilot, who has since been sacked as the Deputy CM.

A 15-member delegation of the Opposition BJP met the Governor on Saturday evening and demanded action to control the “anarchy” in the State and accused the Congress government of threatening constitutional institutions and violating the COVID-19 advisory on social distancing in the protests and demonstrations.

BJP State president Satish Poonia said the Congress leaders were making false accusations against others for their “internal crisis”, while Mr. Gehlot's statement on surrounding Raj Bhavan was a criminal act under Section 124 (assaulting President/Governor with intent to compel or restrain the exercise of any lawful power) of Indian Penal Code.

Earlier in the day, Mr. Gehlot told the MLAs at a Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meeting here that he would go to Rahstrapati Bhavan in New Delhi, if needed, to make sure that the “BJP's conspiracy” to topple his government did not succeed. “If we have to picket Rashtrapati Bhavan or even the Prime Minister's residence, we will do that,” he said.

As the legislators raised their hands in support, Mr. Gehlot asked them to maintain solidarity and stay strong, while indicating that they may have to stay in the hotel on the outskirts of Jaipur for 21 more days to complete the time of advance notice for convening a new session of the Assembly.

“The majority is with us,” Mr. Gehlot affirmed.

The Governor had earlier stated that the note containing the request forwarded by the government neither explained the urgency nor did it mention the agenda for the session.

The Governor sought a clarification on six issues and asked why the session should be convened for a floor test when the government itself was claiming that it had full majority in the House. “No justification has been given for calling the session at such a short notice,” he said.

The Congress workers staged demonstrations at district headquarters across the State on Saturday to protest against the BJP's alleged role in the political turmoil and to press for an Assembly session. The party workers took out a rally in Kota and staged a dharna in Jodhpur, while accusing the BJP of destroying the democratic norms.
