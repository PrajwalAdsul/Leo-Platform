The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Ethics Committee on Saturday gave its approval for conducting the human clinical trial of the indigenously developed Covid-19 vaccine candidate Covaxin.

Dr Sanjay Rai, Professor at the Centre for Community Medicine at AIIMS told ANI that the hospital will start enrolling healthy individuals from Monday onwards.

“Today, we got approval from AIIMS Ethics Committee for starting the human clinical trial of the indigenously developed Covaxin. We are launching the enrollment process from Monday. We are going to select healthy participants with no comorbidities and without a history of Covid-19. The age group of the study population is 18 to 55 years. This would be a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial,” Dr Rai told ANI.

The country’s top drug regulator had recently gave a green signal for human clinical trials for Covid-19 vaccine candidate Covaxin, which has been developed by the Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the ICMR and the National Institute of Virology (NIV).

Asked about the concerns raised by AIIMS Ethics Committee a few days back regarding the trial, Dr Rai said that those concerns were addressed in the Ethics Committee meeting and the panel gave green signal to initiate the trial.

“Any healthy individual who wishes to participate in the trial can send in an email on Ctaiims.Covid19@gmail.com or send an SMS or call on 7428847499,” he said, adding that in the first and second phase AIIMS (Delhi) will choose only 100 participants out of 375 volunteers and the remaining will participate at other sites.

“We have already registered a few volunteers for the trial. From Monday onwards, our team will start their health screening before giving them vaccination,” he said.

It may be noted that there are 12 places where the trial for Covaxin is taking place as per the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR).

Trials have started at AIIMS, Patna and few other places.

ANI had cited Director General of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Dr Balram Bhargava as saying on July 14 that as far as coronavirus pandemic is concerned the country has two indigenous candidate vaccines which scientists are trying best efforts to fast-track as their moral duty so that there should not be a delay of a single day for regulatory clearances for these vaccines to break the transmission of the virus as soon as possible.

“There are two Indian indigenous candidate vaccines and they have gone successful toxicity studies in rats, mice and rabbits. The data was submitted to the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) following which both these candidate vaccines got clearance to start the early phase of human trials,” he had said.

ANI had also reported that DCGI has given its permission to pharma giant Zydus Cadila besides Bharat Biotech International Limited (BBIL), which had partnered with ICMR to conduct phase I/II clinical trials on humans for Covid -19 vaccine.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/science/aiims-to-start-clinical-trial-of-indigenous-vaccine-covaxin-from-monday/story-ccyhna8LNjldKxXE44snHL.html,Covid,/Updated:Ghaziabad,Updated,Ghaziabad,2020-07-19 11:06:38+05:30

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday sharpened his attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) with a three-pronged criticism of the government on a number of issues he has been raising already.

Hours before, Rahul Gandhi had tweeted his criticism of the Centre over its handling of the face-off with China in eastern Ladakh last month, saying India will pay a “huge price because of the government’s cowardly actions”.

On Sunday, the former Congress president added the coronavirus pandemic, India’s economy and the border stand-off with China to his list yet again.

“BJP has institutionalised lies. 1. Covid19 by restricting testing and misreporting deaths. 2. GDP by using a new calculation method. 3. Chinese aggression by frightening the media,” Gandhi posted.

He also repeated his warning from Saturday.

“The illusion will break soon and India will pay the price,” he said.

The Wayanad lawmaker and his party have been raising these issues relentlessly and calling out the government over what they have said is the mishandling of the situations facing the country.

Gandhi had issued a video on Twitter to talk about several aspects of the government’s policies that he said the Centre has destroyed over the last six years and resulted in the present action by the Chinese.

“Since 2014, the PM’s constant blunders and indiscretions have fundamentally weakened India and left us vulnerable. Empty words don’t suffice in the world of geopolitics,” Gandhi tweeted on Friday.

Sushant Singh Rajput’s sister Shweta Singh Kirti has paid a heartfelt tribute to her late brother with a special video that gives a glimpse into his personal life. It comprises of his candid moments captured by his family members with Don McLean’s song Starry, Starry Night from the album American Pie playing in the background.

Shweta wrote along with the video on Instagram, “My Forever Star. A pain so precious so close tat u wldnt trade the world for it!! A wound so deep, so grave you wouldn’t and couldn’t ever share it!” The video has a quote in the beginning, “Somewhere between neurons and narratives I was born, lived (dreamt) and die - Sushant Singh Rajput”.

It opens with Sushant playing a guitar in a room and then on a terrace. He is also seen sketching, doing calligraphy, playing with his dog, looking at the stars from his balcony and even giving lessons in a tuition class. There are also glimpses of him aiming with a rifle (probably during the prep for the film Sonchiriya) and flinging a bat (probably during a practice session for his film MS Dhoni The Untold Story). He is also seen reading in a quiet corner and replying to fan messages on his tablet. One shot also shows him sitting on the pilot’s seat in a small plane, while another shows him looking for stars in the night sky through his telescope. It ends with a funny video of Sushant watching Govinda and Karisma Kapoor’s song Sona Kitna Sona Hai and getting up to dance to the song alongside his dog.

Sushant died by suicide on June 14. He was suffering from depression. His untimely death has led to a massive uproar over the prevalence of nepotism and favouritism in the film industry. Without specifying for whom it was meant for, Shweta had written a cryptic tweet on Instagram on Saturday. She wrote, “Help if you can; if you cannot, fold your hands and stand by and see things go on. Do not injure, if you cannot render help. -- Swami Vivekananda.”

5,12,"Going to the beach in Paris amid Covid-19? Why not test it first?

travel

Updated: Jul 19, 2020 10:28 IST

Parisians heading to the opening of Paris Plages, the yearly transformation of sections of the Seine river into man-made beaches, were met with a new attraction on Saturday: Covid-19 test centres.

A series of indicators across the country, including in the French capital, have suggested the virus could once again be gaining momentum. Authorities are pushing an aggressive testing policy to avoid a return to the peaks seen from March to May.

“At Paris-Plages people have got the time and they really want to know whether they have been sick ... and there are those who need a certificate to travel on some airlines to go on holiday,” Muriel Prudhomme, a doctor and deputy at the townhall’s health department, told Reuters as a steady stream of people of all ages came to be tested.

The artificial beaches on the banks of the Seine in central Paris and the Bassin de la Villette, a man-made lake in the northeast of the city, have been a raging success since they were launched by Paris mayor Bertrand Delanoe in 2002.

As well as sand and views of central Paris’ architecture, Paris Plage offers sporting opportunities such as fencing, giant table-football, and open-air gyms looking out over the Seine, although this year the tighter health restrictions have limited some of the activities.

Along the banks of the river and the Bassin de la Villette, medical teams are now in place at two locations until the end of August offering serological and standard PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests with a capacity to carry out 150 to 200 a day.

“I’m taking all necessary precautions, but there are so many people that don’t seem to care,” said pensioner Nicole Gressier. “I’m going to see my granddaughter who I haven’t seen for nine months, so when I was strolling here I saw it was possible to be tested, so why not?”

The disease has killed more than 30,000 people in France. While it has been under control with fatalities and the number of people in intensive care falling, daily cases have increased ahead of the summer holiday season as people gather in larger groups and travellers come to and from France without specific quarantine measures.

Kais Arbi, 25, who lives in a northwestern Parisian suburb, took the test knowing that he was travelling to see his family in Tunisia in the coming weeks.

“I did the PCR test so I know my current state of health,” said Arbi, who tested negative. “I don’t want to spread it to another country.”

Twitter Inc disabled a campaign-style video that President Donald Trump retweeted on Saturday, citing a copyright complaint.

The video, which included music from the group Linkin Park, disappeared from the president’s Twitter feed late Saturday with the notification: “This media has been disabled in response to a report by the copyright owner.”

Twitter removed the video, which Trump had retweeted from White House social media director Dan Scavino, after it received a Digital Millennium Copyright Act notice from Machine Shop Entertainment, according to a notice posted on the Lumen Database which collects requests for removal of online materials.

Machine Shop is a management company owned by the rock band Linkin Park, according to its LinkedIn page.

“We respond to valid copyright complaints sent to us by a copyright owner or their authorized representatives,” a Twitter representative said in an email statement.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Twitter began challenging Trump’s tweets in May and has repeatedly clashed with him since. The social media company has several times disabled or commented on tweets by the president because of what it said were copyright complaints or violations of a policy against threatening violence.

Twitter removed an image the president tweeted on June 30, which included a picture of Trump, because of a complaint from the New York Times, whose photographer had shot the image.

The company also put a tweet from the president behind a warning label in late May, saying that he had violated its rules against “glorifying violence” when he advocated that Minneapolis authorities be tough in responding to protests over the death of George Floyd.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-disables-donald-trump-s-tweet-over-copyright-complaint/story-KJxBu2taKfS7g3ajOCb4iJ.html,Riot,/Updated:Ghaziabad,Updated,Ghaziabad,2020-07-19 10:25:10+05:30

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday sharpened his attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) with a three-pronged criticism of the government on a number of issues he has been raising already.

Hours before, Rahul Gandhi had tweeted his criticism of the Centre over its handling of the face-off with China in eastern Ladakh last month, saying India will pay a “huge price because of the government’s cowardly actions”.

On Sunday, the former Congress president added the coronavirus pandemic, India’s economy and the border stand-off with China to his list yet again.

“BJP has institutionalised lies. 1. Covid19 by restricting testing and misreporting deaths. 2. GDP by using a new calculation method. 3. Chinese aggression by frightening the media,” Gandhi posted.

He also repeated his warning from Saturday.

“The illusion will break soon and India will pay the price,” he said.

The Wayanad lawmaker and his party have been raising these issues relentlessly and calling out the government over what they have said is the mishandling of the situations facing the country.

Gandhi had issued a video on Twitter to talk about several aspects of the government’s policies that he said the Centre has destroyed over the last six years and resulted in the present action by the Chinese.

“Since 2014, the PM’s constant blunders and indiscretions have fundamentally weakened India and left us vulnerable. Empty words don’t suffice in the world of geopolitics,” Gandhi tweeted on Friday.

That day he gave three reasons behind China’s aggressive stance against India as both the neighbours have clashed on its border in eastern Ladakh in the last few months taking their ties to a new low.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-chamberlain-comparison-rahul-gandhi-attacks-bjp-over-institutionalised-lies/story-3tTr9qqpkwrimNGSBLlX7I.html,Covid,/Updated:Ghaziabad,Updated,Ghaziabad,2020-07-19 11:01:33+05:30

The government has said India’s focus is on early case detection and saving lives.

It pointed out that the 11 most Covid-19 affected countries in the world—the US, Brazil, Russia, Peru, Chile, Mexico, South Africa, the UK, Iran, Pakistan, Spain—together reported eight times more cases and 14 times more deaths than India.

India is only the third country after the United States and Brazil with more than a million cases.

The number of Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra climbed to 300,937, more than 130 days after the first infection was reported in the state. There have been 11,596 fatalities in the state.

The spike in the number of Covid-19 cases in India has resulted in the community spread of the coronavirus disease, according to the Indian Medical Association (IMA). It also said that the situation is pretty bad in the country.

The number of Covid-19 positive cases has crossed a million mark, making India the third country after United States and Brazil to reach this grim milestone.

“This is now an exponential growth. Every day the number of cases is increasing by more than around 30,000. This is really a bad situation for the country,” Dr VK Monga, the Chairman of IMA Hospital Board of India, told news agency ANI.

He further said that the disease is sreading to the rural areas. “This is a bad sign. It now shows a community spread,” said Dr Monga.

The first to sound this alarm was Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan who had said on Friday that there is a community spread in some places in coastal areas of Thiruvananthapuram district.

The two hamlets identified by Vijayan are Poonthura and Pulluvila, which have seen a rapid increase in the number of contact cases.

The district’s coastal area, stretching from Edava in the north to Pozhiyoor in the south, has been declared as Critical Containment Zone (CCZ) and will be under complete and strict lockdown from Saturday midnight to July 28 midnight, an order from the district Collector Dr Navjot Khosa said.

Dr Monga said the cases are penetrating down into towns and villages where it will be very difficult to control the situation. “In Delhi, we were able to contain it, but what about interior parts of the country in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Goa, Madhya Pradesh?”

There are concerns in states like Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Karnataka, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal but the respective state governments have maintained that community spread has not started.

The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), meanwhile, said that it is ramping up testing facilities regularly. At present, 885 government laboratories and 368 private laboratory chains are conducting Covid-19 tests across the country.

As many as 1,34,33,742 samples have been tested for Covid-19 till July 17. Of these 3,61,024 samples were tested on Friday, the ICMR said.

It took India 137 days to reach the million mark (since March 2) in terms of the number of Covid-19 cases, but each quarter of that million has come at a faster pace.

The first 2.5 lakh cases took 98 days. The next quarter of a million cases took less than three weeks (19 days). By July 8, when India was 2.5 lakh cases short of hitting the million mark and it took just eight days for the country to record the last quarter of that million.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/community-spread-of-covid-19-ima-sounds-alarm-icmr-ramps-up-testing-states-keep-tight-vigil/story-82dWsmHJY1ivYTfrigRNyK.html,Riot,/Updated:Ghaziabad,Updated,Ghaziabad,2020-07-19 08:44:27+05:30
