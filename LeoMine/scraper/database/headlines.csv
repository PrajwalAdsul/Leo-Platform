It has been four months to the day since India was put into lockdown to ward off the coronavirus. During the anxious days of Lockdown 1.0,the peak was promised in a few weeks, and then late May. But when the lockdown was eased in May, the only peaks in sight were the Himalayas from Saharanpur.

Where then are the peaks of COVID? In the last few weeks, talk of India soon approaching the COVID-19 peak have begun to be heard in murmurs.

First, it was Public Health Foundation of India president Dr K Srinath Reddy who said that coronavirus incidence could peak in mid-September in India but added that different states could witness different peak periods. Now, it is Prof GVS Murthy of the Indian Institute of Public Health who has reiterated Dr Reddy's message elaborately.

There cannot be a uniform peak in COVID-19 cases in a large country like India and each state has its own trajectory based on when people there were exposed to the infection, Murthy told PTI on Saturday.

Now, among the states and Union Territories, Delhi is predicted to peak by the end of July or early August. While Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra – some of the worst-affected states in India – are likely to witness the corona peak in September, which is in line with Dr Reddy's prediction.

South of Vindhyas: Come September

""States like Telangana, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu should be able to achieve the maximum number of cases by mid-September,"" Murthy said, adding that these states are currently reporting high numbers but won't do so after mid-September.

Tamil Nadu may peak a bit quicker because it boiled up faster. The state with over 2 lakh confirmed cases of COVID-19 can witness its corona peak by the middle or the third week of August. However, the influx of guest workers made it worse for the southern state. Health minister C Vijaybaskar had blamed guest workers, especially those coming from Maharashtra, for the spurt in cases.

Maharashtra has also been held up as one of the contributors to the spurt in Karnataka. The latter state has nearly 91,000 cases but what is more worrying is the slipping recovery rate of patients. Karnataka now has a recovery rate of around 37 per cent, which is much lower than the national average of 63.54 per cent. Moreover, Karnataka's state of affairs is worth noting because just few weeks back, it was being hailed as a success story in contact tracing.

Already under the scanner for alleged under-reporting of cases and fatalities, Telangana has become one of the corona hubs since June. Since June 3, when the state crossed 3,000 cases, the total number of cases has risen by 1,637 per cent. In addition, the state has one of the lowest testing rates, with just 3,37,771 people tested so far.

With testing likely togo up after multiple criticisms of the state administration's handling of the pandemic, there are also chances of cases piling up. So, Telangana witnessing a September looks like a possibility.

Kerala, however, deserves special mention. ""Kerala,you have seen now. They thought they had seen the end of COVID. Suddenly, in the last over 10 days, Kerala has had a much larger number of cases than before,"" Murthy told PTI.

Kerala was being hailed as a model state even by the WHO, which said, “The state government’s prompt response to COVID-19 can be attributed to its experience and investment made in emergency preparedness and outbreak response in the past”. However, the relaxation of the lockdown and the return of Non-Resident Keralites contributed to the rise in cases.

That Kerala has recorded over 1,000 cases thrice in the last four days, is a reminder that the virus is not going away anytime soon.

Guest workers delay peak in states

However, states like Jharkhand, Murthy said, may peak at a later time as the virus began to spread only after the return of guest workers from COVID-19 hubs like Mumbai and Delhi.

""In states like Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and parts of Eastern Uttar Pradesh, the peak will take much longer. The peak would be somewhere towards the end of September or October for those states which had low reporting earlier,"" he said.

Murthy's assessment specially holds true in the case of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh – two of India's biggest migration pools.

As noted in an earlier article, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh had very low rates of infection in comparison to their populations until April 30. That date holds a major significance in India's lockdown story because the Central government began running special trains to ferry guest workers from the next day. Consequently, the numbers of COVID-19 cases began to rise in these two states.

In terms of numbers, Bihar just had 425 confirmed cases of coronavirus on April 30. It now has 36,314 cases of coronavirus. Percentage-wise, this translates to a whopping 8,444 per cent rise in cases. Moreover, Bihar continues to lag behind in testing its population, with just 4.42 lakh tested so far.

Uttar Pradesh does not fare any better. The state has 63,742 confirmed cases of COVID-19. This figure was just 2,211 on April 30. So, there has been a 2,780 per cent rise in the total cases of coronavirus. Notably,eastern UP, economically backward and sending more migrants to West and South India, became the new cause for concern after the influx of guest workers. Varanasi, in eastern UP, is the third-biggest corona hub in UP after the Lucknow-Kanpur urban agglomeration.

Chhattisgarh is an interesting case. The state just had 40 cases on April 30 but now has nearly 7,000 cases – a massive spurt of over 17,000 per cent in less than three months. Interestingly, the state was being hailed for its effective lockdown before returning guest workers undid the gains.

Delhi to see an early peak

On Saturday, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal declared victory against the COVID-19 pandemic but said the battle is far from over. He said in the last one month, the number of coronavirus cases in Delhi has gone down,deaths have reduced, recovery rate has improved and positivity ratio has lowered.

There is truth to Kejriwal's statement. The number of coronavirus cases in June rose by 319 per cent but only by 48.27 per cent in the 25 days of July. Most likely, the growth rate will still be in two digits by the end of July, when Murthy predicts the city-state's corona cases will peak. The recovery rate, too, has improved from 66.79 per cent on June 30 to 87.29 per cent on July 25.

Thus, one may even infer that Delhi, aided by superior medical infrastructure and testing facilities, may already be in the peak stage and the coming few weeks could see a further reduction in the total number of cases.

But implicitly, Murthy may have also reinforced the notion that urban areas equipped with better infrastructure can ward off epidemics better than underdeveloped regions.

Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot said that the party might also approach President Ram Nath Kovind.

“We will sit on a dharna outside the Rashtrapati Bhavan,” Mr Gehlot said after a meeting of the state Cabinet, which had met to re-draft a proposal to governor Kalraj Mishra to call an emergency session of the state Assembly.

Mr Gehlot also indicated that the MLAs in his camp, currently at Jaipur’s Hotel Fairmont, might have to stay there for at least 21 days more.

In Delhi, a senior Congress leader told this newspaper that MPs, MLAs and all other office bearers have been told to launch an online campaign against the BJP from Sunday.

Congress workers staged demonstrations across Rajasthan, specially in Jaipur and other district headquarters, on Saturday after the Rajasthan governor refused to call an emergency Assembly session to let Mr Gehlot prove his majority on the floor of the House.

Party workers demanded that the governor convene a session of the Assembly. In Jaipur, a demonstration was held at the Youth Congress office.

“The BJP is conspiring to topple our government and the public is watching this. Efforts are also being made by invisible powers sitting in Delhi to influence the governor. People want the elected government to complete its tenure,” state Congress president Govind Singh Dotasara said, giving a call for holding the agitation.

The BJP on its part demanded the resignation of Mr Gehlot for protesting at the Raj Bhawan on Friday.

BJP leader Gulab Chand Kataria said: “We have demanded President’s Rule in the state. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot should resign for the kind of language he used Friday.”

Meanwhile, the Cabinet meeting discussed six points raised by governor Kalraj Mishra for calling an Assembly session, sources said. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said the governor has given a note to Mr Gehlot seeking clarifications. “The governor informed that he will abide by the Constitution and will take a decision without being under any pressure,” Mr Surjewala said.",https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/politics/260720/rajasthan-political-crisis-floor-test-or-we-will-protest-says-gehlot.html,Riot,/Said:Jaipur,Said,Jaipur,2020-07-26 11:35:00+05:30,"Rajasthan political crisis: Floor test or we will protest, says Gehlot"

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has said the ground-breaking ceremony for the Ram temple construction in Ayodhya can be conducted through video-conference in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Mr Thackeray, who is also president of the Shiv Sena, said he can go to Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh for the ceremony, but asked if lakhs of ""Ram bhakts"" can be stopped from going there.

According to members of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to visit Ayodhya on August 5 for the ""bhoomi pujan"" ceremony to begin the construction of the Ram temple.

""An e-bhoomi pujan can be done. The ground-breaking ceremony can be held through video-conference. This is an event of joy, and lakhs of people would be interested in attending the ceremony. Will we allow the spread of coronavirus?"" Mr Thackeray said in an interview published in the Shiv Sena mouthpiece ''Saamana'' on Sunday.

He said the Ram temple issue has a background of struggle.

""This is not an ordinary temple. Today, we are fighting the coronavirus pandemic and religious gatherings are prohibited. I can go to Ayodhya for the ceremony, but what about lakhs of Ram bhakts. Will you stop them? You can do e-bhoomi pujan through video-conference,"" he suggested.

Mr Thackeray recalled that the last time when he had gone to Ayodhya, he was stopped from performing ''aarti'' at the Saryu river there since the COVID-19 pandemic spread had just started.

""Before that I had seen huge crowds on the river banks. Ram Mandir is a matter of faith. How can you stop people from going there?"" he asked.

Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who on Saturday confirmed he had tested positive for COVID-19, tweeted Sunday morning to say that he is ""fine"" and to offer his praise for front-line workers in the war on coronavirus.

The Chief Minister also repeated his warnings from yesterday, when he urged people to follow guidelines, such as social distancing and the use of face masks.

""I am fine, my friends. The dedication of coronavirus warriors, who selflessly risk their lives, is praiseworthy. I salute all coronavirus warriors of the state,"" Mr Chouhan tweeted from Bhopal's Chirayu Hospital, where he was admitted yesterday.

""Keep two metres distance, wash your hands frequently and wear face masks - these are the biggest weapons we have to avoid the coronavirus. I appeal to all people - use these weapons for yourself and your loved ones,"" he said.

""All of you be careful, stay safe and healthy. This is what I pray to God,"" Mr Chouhan added.

On Saturday Mr Chouhan had tweeted that he had tested positive for the virus despite his best efforts to avoid infection and warned that ""just a little carelessness invites the coronavirus"".

Tweeting this morning Mr Chouhan said that despite the threat of infection there was ""no need to fear"" and urged those showing symptoms to get themselves tested.

""If you are infected, there is no need to fear. Do not hide symptoms but tell doctors immediately, so treatment can be started. Timely treatment will make you healthy,"" he said.

Madhya Pradesh has nearly 27,000 COVID-19 cases, of which more than 7,600 are active and 799 are deaths linked to the virus.

India has recorded a surge in COVID-19 cases in the past weeks, with over 45,000 new cases detected every day since July 23. The total number of confirmed coronavirus cases is rapidly approaching 14 lakh; of these more than 4.67 lakh are active cases and over 32,000 are deaths linked to the virus.

The spike in cases, coinciding with the staggered relaxation of lockdown guidelines in non-containment zones of the country, has propelled India to third on the list of most affected nations.

4,4,"Uddhav Thackeray said he hadn't switched sides, but only entered into an alliance.

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has dared the opposition to topple his government and said though it is a ""three-wheeler"" government, he is firmly in control of its steering wheel.

Mr Thackeray, who is also president of the Shiv Sena, said his alliance partners - NCP and Congress - are ""positive"" and the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is benefitting from their experience.

He also took an aim at the Centre's ambitious Mumbai- Ahmedabad bullet train project, saying he would rather prefer such a high speed link between the state capital and Nagpur.

""The future of my government is not in the hands of the opposition. The steering is in my hands. A three-wheeler (auto-rickshaw) is a vehicle of poor people. The other two are sitting behind,"" Mr Thackeray said in the second and last part of his interview published in Shiv Sena mouthpiece ''Saamana'' on Sunday, ahead of his 60th birthday on Monday.

""Why wait for September-October as is being speculated. Topple the government right now since you get pleasure in toppling. Some people derive pleasure in constructive work while some are happy in destruction. If you feel happy in destruction, go ahead,"" he said.

""You say the MVA government is formed against the democratic principles but when you topple it, is it democracy?"" the chief minister asked.

Notably, his predecessor Devendra Fadnavis earlier compared the ruling MVA, comprising the Shiv Sena and its ideological opponents Congress and NCP, with a three-wheeler, auto-rickshaw, and raised doubts over its stability.

To a question, Mr Thackeray said he hadn't switched sides, but only entered into an alliance.

""I did this because the purpose with which I had joined hands earlier turned out to be hollow,"" he said.

Asserting that the party ideology is important, he said, ""Show me one leader who has reached the top position in the party which he has defected to. It is all use and throw policy.""

Targeting the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project, he said, ""A three-wheeler is a vehicle of poor people. If I have to choose between a bullet train and an auto-rickshaw,I will chose the auto-rickshaw. If people don't want a bullet train, then it will not happen,"" he said.

""If my government is a three-wheeler, it is moving in a proper direction, why should you have stomachache?"" he said in a veiled attack at the opposition BJP.

Mr Thackeray said when he attended the NDA meeting last time, ""there were 30 to 35 wheels like a railway train"".

The chief minister said he would scrap projects which people feel are unwanted.

He said MoUs worth Rs 16,000 crore signed recently are in initial stages and more investments are on the anvil.

""If the state requires a bullet train, I would demand a bullet train to connect Mumbai and Nagpur. I would like a bullet train which connects my state capital and the second capital. The feeling of neglect among people of Vidarbha would be wiped out. Just like the Mumbai Nagpur Samruddhi corridor, I would be happy with a bullet train,"" he said.

He also said the Congress's grievance of being neglected in the three-party alliance government was resolved after his meeting with the state Congress leaders.

""I have good coordination with (NCP chief) Sharad Pawar. I make a phone call to (Congress president) Sonia Gandhi some times,"" he said.

Mr Thackeray asserted that the tripartite MVA government was functioning well.

""I admit that in the last few months, face-to-face meetings haven't happened. One more minister is coronavirus positive now after Jitendra Awhad, Ashok Chavan and Dhananjay Munde. All ministers are in touch with each other over phone or through video conferencing,"" he said.

Mr Thackeray admitted the state's economy is not in good shape, but noted the entire world is facing such a crisis.

He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked all chief ministers not to announce any waivers or subsidies as populist measures due to which the economy would be further burdened.

In an apparent reference to his criticism over not moving out during the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr Thackeray said discussions and deliberations as well as signing of MoUs were being done by him sitting at home.

Asked about the participation of Chinese firms in investing in the state, he said more than the presence of Chinese firms in the recent MoUs, what is important is whether Chinese investments should remain in the country or not.

""During a video conference meeting with the prime minister, I had requested him to frame a national policy on doing business with China,"" he said.

Mr Thackeray also said his government had kept the MoUs with Chinese firms on hold.

""There should be a policy on whether Chinese companies should be allowed to do business in the country. If tomorrow, the situation improves and the Chinese prime minister is welcomed in India, why should we miss the business opportunities now?"" he asked.

The chief minister also rejected criticism that bureaucracy has an upper hand in his government.

6,19,"Paleogenomics has amounted to a ""revolution"" in understanding disease history. (Istock)

As the novel coronavirus pandemic reshapes lives and entire economies, historians tell us this is not the first time. The earliest written records of tiny infectious organisms overhauling human societies stretch back as far as the Plague of Justinian in A.D. 541, which is thought to have killed up to 50 million people, or even the earlier Antonine Plague in A.D. 165, which left 5 million dead, a substantial portion of the world then.

Now, paleogenomics - a nascent field that studies DNA in remnants of ancient teeth - is rewriting the first chapter of humanity's entanglement with disease to thousands of years older than originally thought. The growing evidence suggests that these first epidemics forced societies to make epoch-defining transformations.

""In the case of covid-19 [the disease caused by the coronavirus], we see similar processes, but we are watching it unfold in real time,"" said Anne Stone, regents professor in the School of Human Evolution and Social Change at Arizona State University, whose focus is anthropological genetics. She also has studied evidence of tuberculosis in ancient DNA.

Paleogenomics, which adapts high-end medical tools similar to some now being used to track the coronavirus, has amounted to a ""revolution"" in understanding disease history, says Maria Spyrou, a microbiologist at the Max Planck Institute in Germany.

""This is one of the things that we can now start saying,"" said Spyrou, adding that where historical records are lacking, DNA evidence offers the possibility of filling in gaps, sometimes in surprising ways.

""One of them is plague,"" Spyrou said. ""Until 2015, we thought that plague was maybe a 3,000-year-old disease.""

Scientists and archaeologists now believe, however, that the plague bacteria, which caused the medieval Black Death that killed up to half of Europe's population, infected humans roughly 5,000 years ago in the Stone Age. The bacteria, after it had entered the bloodstream and likely killed the host, circulated into the pulp chamber of teeth, which kept its DNA insulated from millennia of environmental wear and tear. In the past decade, scientists have been able to extract and analyze that DNA.

The Stone Age plague was, however, an ancestor with a slightly different genetic identity. Tracking how those differences evolve helps infectious-disease biologists better understand what causes disease and how to prepare for current outbreaks. The plague bacteria in the Stone Age, for example, lacked the genes necessary to jump from fleas to humans, which likely spread the Black Death widely.

Without the flea gene, the disease probably used another animal transmitter that came into contact with humans. In 2018, a University of Copenhagen team published the first evidence, based on early data three years before, that the ancient plague bacteria, found in a Swedish settlement, had the power to kill and may have threatened life in the age's ""mega-settlements"" that could spread diseases quickly.

""It probably was the first pandemic,"" said Simon Rasmussen, a genomicist at the university and lead researcher on the plague study. In the Stone Age, also called the Neolithic period, humans made unprecedented moves to gather in large settlements with up to 10,000 people in close quarters with animals and virtually no sanitation. ""It's the textbook place of where you could have a new pathogen,"" he said.

Paleogenomics has also allowed archaeologists to fill in one of the biggest silences in the archaeological record: disease. Pathogens rarely leave traces on bones, and populations without writing could die out without any readable record of the cause. With the ability to read traces of DNA preserved in teeth, historians are learning about the organisms inside ancient humans.

Kristian Kristiansen, a University of Copenhagen archaeologist and a co-author of the plague study, believes his group's research illuminates the causes of a Stone Age demographic transformation, called the Neolithic decline, which archaeologists have long studied.

Settlements at the time were disappearing faster than they were appearing, and within a few hundred years, most of the population had been replaced by migrants from the Eurasian Steppe. Researchers had only ever hypothesized that disease may have played a role in crippling the native population before it was overtaken, but now they have evidence, Kristiansen says.

""The steppe migrations would not have succeeded without the plague . . . and [those living in what is now Europe] would not all have spoken Indo-European languages,"" Kristiansen said. ""Later prehistory has been turned upside down to say the least.""

In 2018, a paleogenomics team analyzed ancient teeth from Neolithic sites in present-day Germany and discovered the hepatitis B virus stretched back at least 7,000 years. Another study the same year extended our knowledge of the history of parvovirus B19 from a few hundred years to 6,900 years. Parvovirus B19 causes a mild rash in humans and leads to outbreaks in the United States every few years

In February, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology published evidence that types of Salmonella bacteria, which sicken about a million people in the United States every year, were afflicting humans 6,500 years ago. Microbiologist Felix Key identified Salmonella DNA in teeth recovered from burial sites near the Volga River in present-day Russia, where archaeological evidence has shown that humans began to abandon foraging for pastoral living. The Salmonella DNA in their teeth is the first evidence, Key says, that the adoption of this lifestyle in close contact with animals may have introduced pathogens to humans.

""This ancient DNA could give us the means to prove or disprove the hypothesis that the Neolithic revolution was the major event for introducing diseases into humans,"" said Key, who is now at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History. ""My hunch is that it did facilitate the disease, because humans and animals were co-housed.""

Like many paleogenomicists, Key uses dentist tools and dons what looks like a hazmat suit that blocks possible DNA contamination from teeth recovered from settlements thousands of years older than the Roman Empire.

New methods of extracting DNA that were developed for medical purposes have made paleogenomics possible in the past decade. After using dentist tools to recover and pulverize material locked inside a tooth, molecular biologists use a technique called ""shotgun sequencing"" to extract all genetic material without needing to know what to look for. Decrypting the data then requires that bioinformatic specialists can match the genetic identities to known pathogens. As the disease database grows, it becomes easier to identify signals from noise. Archaeologists then have the task of putting human disease into historical context.

The process is expensive, and it's dominated by labs in Europe with equipment and funding. Conducting a complete survey of teeth can cost upward of $1 million. That depends, still, on a team's good fortune in finding enough ancient teeth that have experienced the right conditions over millennia to preserve pathogen DNA. In the study of the Salmonella bacteria, Key's team analyzed 3,000 samples and found just eight with preserved Salmonella bacteria.

Rasmussen, of the Copenhagen plague study, said that, while he is fairly certain his team's evidence describes the oldest human pandemic, more DNA samples must be found and analyzed. The DNA used in his study come from just one small settlement in the area of modern-day Sweden. To prove a pandemic, Rasmussen said, scientists will need to find DNA evidence in some larger sites - in other parts of Europe.

Even so, Stone said, paleogenomics has shown that humans have been in ""an arms race with pathogens"" for thousands of years.

""Periodically, pathogens jump into humans,"" she said, ""and it's really easy to become complacent when you don't happen to have a pathogen affecting large segments of your population at the moment. But you let those resources go at your peril, which we're seeing right now.""

The Chief Minister also repeated his warnings from yesterday, when he urged people to follow guidelines, such as social distancing and the use of face masks.

""I am fine, my friends. The dedication of coronavirus warriors, who selflessly risk their lives, is praiseworthy. I salute all coronavirus warriors of the state,"" Mr Chouhan tweeted from Bhopal's Chirayu Hospital, where he was admitted yesterday.

""Keep two metres distance, wash your hands frequently and wear face masks - these are the biggest weapons we have to avoid the coronavirus. I appeal to all people - use these weapons for yourself and your loved ones,"" he said.

""All of you be careful, stay safe and healthy. This is what I pray to God,"" Mr Chouhan added.

On Saturday Mr Chouhan had tweeted that he had tested positive for the virus despite his best efforts to avoid infection and warned that ""just a little carelessness invites the coronavirus"".

Tweeting this morning Mr Chouhan said that despite the threat of infection there was ""no need to fear"" and urged those showing symptoms to get themselves tested.

""If you are infected, there is no need to fear. Do not hide symptoms but tell doctors immediately, so treatment can be started. Timely treatment will make you healthy,"" he said.

10,28,"Uddhav Thackeray said he hadn't switched sides, but only entered into an alliance.

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has dared the opposition to topple his government and said though it is a ""three-wheeler"" government, he is firmly in control of its steering wheel.

Mr Thackeray, who is also president of the Shiv Sena, said his alliance partners - NCP and Congress - are ""positive"" and the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is benefitting from their experience.

He also took an aim at the Centre's ambitious Mumbai- Ahmedabad bullet train project, saying he would rather prefer such a high speed link between the state capital and Nagpur.

""The future of my government is not in the hands of the opposition. The steering is in my hands. A three-wheeler (auto-rickshaw) is a vehicle of poor people. The other two are sitting behind,"" Mr Thackeray said in the second and last part of his interview published in Shiv Sena mouthpiece ''Saamana'' on Sunday, ahead of his 60th birthday on Monday.

""Why wait for September-October as is being speculated. Topple the government right now since you get pleasure in toppling. Some people derive pleasure in constructive work while some are happy in destruction. If you feel happy in destruction, go ahead,"" he said.

""You say the MVA government is formed against the democratic principles but when you topple it, is it democracy?"" the chief minister asked.

Notably, his predecessor Devendra Fadnavis earlier compared the ruling MVA, comprising the Shiv Sena and its ideological opponents Congress and NCP, with a three-wheeler, auto-rickshaw, and raised doubts over its stability.

To a question, Mr Thackeray said he hadn't switched sides, but only entered into an alliance.

""I did this because the purpose with which I had joined hands earlier turned out to be hollow,"" he said.

Asserting that the party ideology is important, he said, ""Show me one leader who has reached the top position in the party which he has defected to. It is all use and throw policy.""

Targeting the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project, he said, ""A three-wheeler is a vehicle of poor people. If I have to choose between a bullet train and an auto-rickshaw,I will chose the auto-rickshaw. If people don't want a bullet train, then it will not happen,"" he said.

""If my government is a three-wheeler, it is moving in a proper direction, why should you have stomachache?"" he said in a veiled attack at the opposition BJP.

Mr Thackeray said when he attended the NDA meeting last time, ""there were 30 to 35 wheels like a railway train"".

The chief minister said he would scrap projects which people feel are unwanted.

He said MoUs worth Rs 16,000 crore signed recently are in initial stages and more investments are on the anvil.

""If the state requires a bullet train, I would demand a bullet train to connect Mumbai and Nagpur. I would like a bullet train which connects my state capital and the second capital. The feeling of neglect among people of Vidarbha would be wiped out. Just like the Mumbai Nagpur Samruddhi corridor, I would be happy with a bullet train,"" he said.

He also said the Congress's grievance of being neglected in the three-party alliance government was resolved after his meeting with the state Congress leaders.

""I have good coordination with (NCP chief) Sharad Pawar. I make a phone call to (Congress president) Sonia Gandhi some times,"" he said.

Mr Thackeray asserted that the tripartite MVA government was functioning well.

""I admit that in the last few months, face-to-face meetings haven't happened. One more minister is coronavirus positive now after Jitendra Awhad, Ashok Chavan and Dhananjay Munde. All ministers are in touch with each other over phone or through video conferencing,"" he said.

Mr Thackeray admitted the state's economy is not in good shape, but noted the entire world is facing such a crisis.

He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked all chief ministers not to announce any waivers or subsidies as populist measures due to which the economy would be further burdened.

In an apparent reference to his criticism over not moving out during the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr Thackeray said discussions and deliberations as well as signing of MoUs were being done by him sitting at home.

Asked about the participation of Chinese firms in investing in the state, he said more than the presence of Chinese firms in the recent MoUs, what is important is whether Chinese investments should remain in the country or not.

""During a video conference meeting with the prime minister, I had requested him to frame a national policy on doing business with China,"" he said.

Mr Thackeray also said his government had kept the MoUs with Chinese firms on hold.

""There should be a policy on whether Chinese companies should be allowed to do business in the country. If tomorrow, the situation improves and the Chinese prime minister is welcomed in India, why should we miss the business opportunities now?"" he asked.

The chief minister also rejected criticism that bureaucracy has an upper hand in his government.

""The government is the decision-maker and bureaucracy implements the decisions,"" he added.",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/maharashtra-chief-minister-uddhav-thackeray-maha-vikas-aghadi-mva-governments-steering-wheel-is-in-my-hands-2268996,Covid,/Centre:Mumbai,Centre,Mumbai,,"Maharashtra Government's ""Steering Wheel"" In My Hands: Uddhav Thackeray"

Vietnam reintroduced social distancing measures in the central city of Danang on Sunday after a second locally transmitted novel coronavirus case was detected there, more than three months after any cases were reported in the country.

The Southeast Asian country was back on high alert after the government on Saturday confirmed its first community infection since April, and another case early on Sunday, both in Danang, a tourist hot spot.

Authorities gave no more details about how the two infections were contracted and did not say if they were believed to be linked.

The city’s social distancing measures would come into force until further notice, the government said in a statement on its website.

Danang would stop receiving inbound tourists for 14 days, while all religious, sports and cultural events would be suspended.

Wearing masks in public places in the city is now compulsory and gatherings of more than 30 people at public places were banned, the government said.

The detection of the two new cases, which come as Vietnam is seeking to revive its economy and resume international commercial flights, has prompted authorities to step up a crackdown on illegal immigrants.

State media said dozens of migrants from China had been detected in Danang over recent days.

Thanks to strict quarantine measures and an aggressive and widespread testing programme, Vietnam has kept its virus total to an impressively low 418 cases, with no deaths.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vietnam-s-danang-city-reimposes-social-distancing-after-first-local-covid-cases-in-months/story-1enKYGe9FWx4G74fnT1E3M.html,Covid,/Updated:Ghaziabad,Updated,Ghaziabad,2020-07-26 13:00:11+05:30,Vietnam’s Danang city reimposes social distancing after first local Covid cases in months

The Bombay high court bench in Goa has asked the state government and Dr Edwin Gomes, who pioneered the state’s battle against the Covid-19 pandemic, to amicably settle the issue the issue of his pending leaves.

The court made the remark while hearing a petition filed by the wife of Dr Gomes where she claimed that he was not being granted leave nor being relieved from duties.

Dr Gomes, who helped set up the state’s dedicated Covid-19 facility at the ESI Hospital in Margao in South Goa and headed the hospital for close to three months, was granted three weeks’ time off but urged to resume after the time elapsed.

“[The parties agree that] it will be in public interest if the Secretary, Health and Dr Edwin Gomes have a meeting by video conference to discuss certain issues relating to Covid-19 situation including the issues raised. We also feel that these matters can be best sorted out at the earliest, so that the focus is not shifted and continues to be on combating the unfortunate situation we all are in, on account of the pandemic,” the bench of Justices M S Sonak and M S Jawalkar said.

“We trust that both Dr Gomes as well as the health cecretary will approach this matter from this perspective and refrain from treating this matter as some adversarial litigation. Taking into consideration the yeoman services rendered by Dr Gomes during this difficult period and the valuable experience he has gained, we are sure that his suggestions will be most valuable to the state administration, which is also engaged very actively in combating this unfortunate situation,” the court said.

Dr Gomes returned home on July 4 after completing 98 days of uninterrupted duty. He was given a hero’s welcome by the locals near his home on the outskirts of Panaji.

A few days later, he tested positive for the novel coronavirus forcing the state to grant him more time off. However, having subsequently recovered, the state has been urging him to rejoin the duty.

His wife, in the petition before the court, claimed that the health minister made a statement that Dr Edwin will be kept for Covid-19 duties until the pandemic is over as he is doing a good job.

“We will appreciate it if the meeting between Dr Gomes and the health secretary is held at the earliest and in any case, within a period of one week from today.

President Xi Jinping’s strategy to expand its territorial dispute with Bhutan to needle India appears to have brought the tiny kingdom nestled in the Himalayas closer to New Delhi. Thimphu, which had last found itself caught in the crossfire between India and China during the 2017 Doklam standoff appeared to have had second thoughts about its proximity to India vis-a-vis China, people familiar with the developments told Hindustan Times.

There was lately, an emerging view in Bhutan, wedged geographically between India and China, that the kingdom should perhaps balance its ties with its two neighbours so that Thimphu isn’t squeezed between the giants again. “It was never spelt out in black and white but this view was gaining ground over the last two-three years,” people in New Delhi and Thimphu said.

But there has been a change in Thimpu’s approach over the last one month after Beijing stunned Bhutan at the June meeting of the US-based multinational fund, Global Environment Facility, when Thimphu was seeking funds for the Sakteng wildlife sanctuary. The Chinese representative objected, claiming that there was a dispute between China and Bhutan over part of the sanctuary spread across 650 sq km.

The Chinese move to make new territorial claims in Bhutan has convinced Thimpu that it should not hang to any hopes that its northern neighbour, 250 times bigger, would be fair. That if it cedes any ground to appease Beijing, it would only end up fueling its territorial ambitions, the people mentioned above said.

Thimphu formally protested the China claim, issuing a demarche to the Chinese mission in Delhi. Bhutan and Beijing use their missions in Delhi to communicate. It also issued a rare statement earlier this month, underlining that disputes relating to the undemarcated border would be discussed at the next round of border talks.

Bhutan and China have held 24 rounds of talks since 1984 to settle their border issue, the last in 2016. Beijing has been pressuring Bhutan to accept a package deal for nearly 20 years that would let it take over Bhutanese territory of Doklam, Sinchulung, Dramana, and Shakhatoe spread across 269 sq km in the western sector. In exchange, China would give up its claim over Bhutan’s Pasamlung and Jakarlung valleys in the north.

China’s claim over the nature preserve spread across 650 sq km in eastern Bhutan’s Trashigang district almost doubles the area of the disputed territories between the two countries from the existing 764 sq km.

Bhutan is yet to decide on an Indian proposal to build a road through the sanctuary that would sharply reduce the 450 km long distance between Guwahati and Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh by one-third. New Delhi is expected to take up the proposal with Thimphu as part of India’s hard push to border infrastructure.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-tried-to-jab-india-with-a-new-claim-on-bhutan-why-it-has-boomeranged/story-rqplyG6gdbN7eOs3X1FInM.html,Riot,/Updated:Ghaziabad,Updated,Ghaziabad,2020-07-26 07:44:08+05:30,China tried to jab India with a new claim on Bhutan.

*PM Modi reminded the nation of the need to continue to wear masks and said “ if you get tired of wearing masks, think of corona warriors.” “They keep wearing masks continuously for hours and are working to save everyone’s lives. They keep wearing the mask for eight to ten hours. Aren’t they troubled?” he asked.

*Need to remain vigilant, says PM Modi

“India’s Covid-19 recovery rate is better than others. Our fatality rate is much less than most other countries. We are able to save the lives of lakhs of people but threat of coronavirus is not over yet. It is spreading at a rapid pace which is why we need to remain vigilant,” PM Modi said.

The Bombay high court bench in Goa has asked the state government and Dr Edwin Gomes, who pioneered the state’s battle against the Covid-19 pandemic, to amicably settle the issue the issue of his pending leaves.

The court made the remark while hearing a petition filed by the wife of Dr Gomes where she claimed that he was not being granted leave nor being relieved from duties.

Dr Gomes, who helped set up the state’s dedicated Covid-19 facility at the ESI Hospital in Margao in South Goa and headed the hospital for close to three months, was granted three weeks’ time off but urged to resume after the time elapsed.

“[The parties agree that] it will be in public interest if the Secretary, Health and Dr Edwin Gomes have a meeting by video conference to discuss certain issues relating to Covid-19 situation including the issues raised. We also feel that these matters can be best sorted out at the earliest, so that the focus is not shifted and continues to be on combating the unfortunate situation we all are in, on account of the pandemic,” the bench of Justices M S Sonak and M S Jawalkar said.

“We trust that both Dr Gomes as well as the health cecretary will approach this matter from this perspective and refrain from treating this matter as some adversarial litigation. Taking into consideration the yeoman services rendered by Dr Gomes during this difficult period and the valuable experience he has gained, we are sure that his suggestions will be most valuable to the state administration, which is also engaged very actively in combating this unfortunate situation,” the court said.

Dr Gomes returned home on July 4 after completing 98 days of uninterrupted duty. He was given a hero’s welcome by the locals near his home on the outskirts of Panaji.

A few days later, he tested positive for the novel coronavirus forcing the state to grant him more time off. However, having subsequently recovered, the state has been urging him to rejoin the duty.

His wife, in the petition before the court, claimed that the health minister made a statement that Dr Edwin will be kept for Covid-19 duties until the pandemic is over as he is doing a good job.

“We will appreciate it if the meeting between Dr Gomes and the health secretary is held at the earliest and in any case, within a period of one week from today. We are sure that the initiative for this meeting will be taken by the health secretary and necessary intimation will be given to Dr Gomes and further, all assistance will also be rendered to Dr Gomes to attend this meeting through video conferencing,” the court said.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-s-hero-doctor-govt-spar-over-time-off-during-covid-19-court-seeks-amicable-solution/story-vtlwdhRt4FaheHFktmDatK.html,Covid,/Updated:Ghaziabad,Updated,Ghaziabad,2020-07-26 12:45:58+05:30,"Goa’s hero doctor, govt spar over time off during Covid-19; court seeks amicable solution"

The Kissing Booth 2

Director: Vince Marcello

Cast: Joey King, Jacob Elordi, Joel Courtney, Taylor Zakhar Perez

Lara Jean may have been able to resist the charms of a second hot boy in her life but Elle Evans may not be made of such stern stuff. The Kissing Booth 2 presents a similar dilemma to its nerdy American high schooler lead, as earlier this year’s To All The Boys: PS I Love You—falling for another unearthly cute guy when you already have an unearthly cute guy in your arms. However, The Kissing Booth 2 is not as stylish or even half as heartfelt, making it just a quarter as enjoyable.

Watch the trailer for The Kissing Booth 2:

Set in the fantastical, faraway land of Netflix high school romcoms where one regularly gets the option to choose between two perfect specimens of human males, The Kissing Booth 2 is unable to find a true calling, purpose or justification for a sequel. It sits at a bloated runtime of 130 minutes and to while it away, it employs any and every conflict possible. There’re jealous girlfriends, annoying best friends, lying boys, seduced girls, fear of the future, a dance competition, adultery, self doubt, the uncaring way of life, forbidden love, and the belief in the existence of soulmates. But much like that inedible broth, too many conflicts also spoil what could have been a slick high school comedy.

This time, Elle (Joey King) must navigate life through senior year at her sunny California school after her boyfriend Noah (Jacob Elordi) leaves for Harvard. They decide to give long distance relationship a chance, a promise that is not helped by the arrival of a dashing new admission at school, Marco (Taylor Zakhar Perez). With his curls, sweaty gym videos and guitar, he soon makes long distance celibacy a tough task for Elle, who is already turned into the doubting girlfriend, jealous of Noah’s gorgeous new friend at college, Chloe (Maisie Richardson).

Any other high school movie would have perhaps been content with so much on their plate but not this one. This love-quadrangle is only in addition to the conflict brewing between Elle, her best friend Lee (Joel Courtney) and his frankly frustrated girlfriend Rachel. While Elle and Lee’s friendship, their Dance Dance Revolution sessions and the easy, electric chemistry between Joey and Joel make for some of the best things about the film, Rachel is not so cool with Elle third-wheeling them all the time. If the break-ups and the proclamations of the core group were too much to keep track of, this only adds to the chaos.

Even with constant voice-overs about her feelings and learnings—Elle is writing her letters of applications to various colleges throughout the film—it still gets confusing to keep up with her many musings and motivations. The film is incredibly stretched. A scene in the beginning, about a ‘comedic’ disaster with the school announcement system, drags on for a torturous minute. There is very little humour about it and even less so when it plays out with that chaotic, Disney Channel energy.

The jealous girlfriend plot also takes multiple revisits to finally establish the excuse to dump the past and move on to a guitar-strumming, curly haired future. And frankly, Joey and Jacob’s negligible amount of scenes together—the secret, forbidden romance from the first part replaced by Skype calls and unread texts—makes it hard to root for ‘Elno’ anyway.

But The Kissing Booth 2 is not without its moments of genuine goodness. Taylor’s charming powers can be felt through your screens even as he woos Elle on the DDM machine or plays her a sweet song at the beach, talking about how he would treat her right. Their electric scenes make you second guess the validity of Elle and Noah’s long confessions of love and maybe, just this once, you’d have let the heroine break up with Colin Firth for Hugh Grant.

A third love story—about a boy finding the courage to come out to his school, confess his love for a genius dork—also brings sweet respite from Elle and her many troubles. The ending of the film, even though rushed, feels almost acceptable just for the sake of these two.

The Kissing Booth 2 ( Marcos Cruz/Netflix )

Joey is still a good fit for Elle. She can be convincingly excited about Halloween costumes and also heartbroken over a cheating boyfriend. Jacob, however, appeared to have checked out of that Zoom call a while ago.

With its bubblegum filters, school kids in convertibles on a sunny street and mediocre essays being deemed fit for a Harvard acceptance letter, there is much that separates The Kissing Booth 2 from reality. Which is why it is quite the right specimen of the high school romantic comedy section of Netflix.

Sourav Ganguly has built his reputation for not just being a great cricketer but also an able leader. He was the captain of Team India in the early 2000s and is credited with transforming the fortunes of the side with his fearless leadership. After his retirement, Ganguly gradually shifted his focus towards administration. He first became the president of the Bengal Cricket Association and worked to improve the state of cricket in the region.

Then last year, Ganguly was unanimously elected as the President of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). However, Ganguly’s name has also started doing the rounds for the vacant post of ICC Chairman. Shashank Manohar stepped down from the post recently and several cricketers have backed Ganguly to become the next ICC Chairman.

READ | Sourav Ganguly tests negative for Covid-19

Sri Lankan cricket great Kumar Sangakkara also weighed in on the subject and said that Ganguly is a suitable candidate for the post due to his astute cricket brain.

“I think Sourav definitely can make that change. Quite a big fan of Dada not just because of his stature as a cricketer but I think he has a very astute cricket brain. He has the best interests of the game at heart and that should not change just because you are the BCCI president or the ECB or SLC or any other cricket board when you are at the ICC.

“Your mindset should be truly international and not just constrained by partisanship in terms of where I come from -- am I Indian, Sri Lankan or Australia or English but really understand ‘yes I am a cricketer and what I am doing is what is best for all cricketing countries,” Kumar Sangakkara told India Today.

“Most importantly, the foundation of this game is children, fans, and spectators around the world. I think Sourav can do that very, very well. I have seen his work even before he took over as the BCCI president, even before administration and coaching, and how he has built relationships with players around the world, his standing in the MCC cricket committee. I have no doubt that Sourav will be a very, very suitable candidate to do just that,” Kumar Sangakkara asserted.

Cricket South Africa (CSA) director of Cricket Graeme Smith also wants Sourav Ganguly to take over ICC chairmanship in this tough period for cricket. Smith’s comments were backed by CSA CEO Jacques Faul, who also said that South Africa won’t have any objection to an Indian again heading the ICC.

“From our perspective, it would be great to see a cricket man like Sourav Ganguly maybe getting into the President’s role of the ICC,” Smith told reporters.

“I think that will be good for the game; I think it will be good for the modern game as well.

Addressing the 67th edition of his monthly radio programme Mann Ki Baat, PM Modi hailed the declining Covid-19 fatality rate and increasing recovery rate and at the same time emphasised that the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) continues to be lethal.

“We have been able to save the lives of lakhs of people but the threat of coronavirus is not over yet. It is spreading fast in many areas and we need to remain vigilant,” he said.

PM Modi said people have to continue wearing masks, keep a distance of two yards, wash hands continuously, not spit anywhere and take full care of cleanliness as these are the weapons that can protect us against the coronavirus disease.

“At such a time, I would urge you that whenever you feel troubled because of the mask and feel like removing it, then, for a moment, remember those doctors, nurses and corona warriors,” he said.

“They keep wearing masks continuously for hours and are working to save everyone’s lives. They keep wearing the mask for eight to ten hours. Aren’t they troubled?” he asked.

President Xi Jinping’s strategy to expand its territorial dispute with Bhutan to needle India appears to have brought the tiny kingdom nestled in the Himalayas closer to New Delhi. Thimphu, which had last found itself caught in the crossfire between India and China during the 2017 Doklam standoff appeared to have had second thoughts about its proximity to India vis-a-vis China, people familiar with the developments told Hindustan Times.

There was lately, an emerging view in Bhutan, wedged geographically between India and China, that the kingdom should perhaps balance its ties with its two neighbours so that Thimphu isn’t squeezed between the giants again. “It was never spelt out in black and white but this view was gaining ground over the last two-three years,” people in New Delhi and Thimphu said.

But there has been a change in Thimpu’s approach over the last one month after Beijing stunned Bhutan at the June meeting of the US-based multinational fund, Global Environment Facility, when Thimphu was seeking funds for the Sakteng wildlife sanctuary. The Chinese representative objected, claiming that there was a dispute between China and Bhutan over part of the sanctuary spread across 650 sq km.

The Chinese move to make new territorial claims in Bhutan has convinced Thimpu that it should not hang to any hopes that its northern neighbour, 250 times bigger, would be fair. That if it cedes any ground to appease Beijing, it would only end up fueling its territorial ambitions, the people mentioned above said.

Thimphu formally protested the China claim, issuing a demarche to the Chinese mission in Delhi. Bhutan and Beijing use their missions in Delhi to communicate. It also issued a rare statement earlier this month, underlining that disputes relating to the undemarcated border would be discussed at the next round of border talks.

Bhutan and China have held 24 rounds of talks since 1984 to settle their border issue, the last in 2016. Beijing has been pressuring Bhutan to accept a package deal for nearly 20 years that would let it take over Bhutanese territory of Doklam, Sinchulung, Dramana, and Shakhatoe spread across 269 sq km in the western sector. In exchange, China would give up its claim over Bhutan’s Pasamlung and Jakarlung valleys in the north.

China’s claim over the nature preserve spread across 650 sq km in eastern Bhutan’s Trashigang district almost doubles the area of the disputed territories between the two countries from the existing 764 sq km.

Bhutan is yet to decide on an Indian proposal to build a road through the sanctuary that would sharply reduce the 450 km long distance between Guwahati and Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh by one-third. New Delhi is expected to take up the proposal with Thimphu as part of India’s hard push to border infrastructure.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-tried-to-jab-india-with-a-new-claim-on-bhutan-why-it-has-boomeranged/story-rqplyG6gdbN7eOs3X1FInM.html,Riot,/Updated:Ghaziabad,Updated,Ghaziabad,2020-07-26 07:44:08+05:30,China tried to jab India with a new claim on Bhutan.

The Bombay high court bench in Goa has asked the state government and Dr Edwin Gomes, who pioneered the state’s battle against the Covid-19 pandemic, to amicably settle the issue the issue of his pending leaves.

The court made the remark while hearing a petition filed by the wife of Dr Gomes where she claimed that he was not being granted leave nor being relieved from duties.

Dr Gomes, who helped set up the state’s dedicated Covid-19 facility at the ESI Hospital in Margao in South Goa and headed the hospital for close to three months, was granted three weeks’ time off but urged to resume after the time elapsed.

“[The parties agree that] it will be in public interest if the Secretary, Health and Dr Edwin Gomes have a meeting by video conference to discuss certain issues relating to Covid-19 situation including the issues raised. We also feel that these matters can be best sorted out at the earliest, so that the focus is not shifted and continues to be on combating the unfortunate situation we all are in, on account of the pandemic,” the bench of Justices M S Sonak and M S Jawalkar said.

“We trust that both Dr Gomes as well as the health cecretary will approach this matter from this perspective and refrain from treating this matter as some adversarial litigation. Taking into consideration the yeoman services rendered by Dr Gomes during this difficult period and the valuable experience he has gained, we are sure that his suggestions will be most valuable to the state administration, which is also engaged very actively in combating this unfortunate situation,” the court said.

Dr Gomes returned home on July 4 after completing 98 days of uninterrupted duty. He was given a hero’s welcome by the locals near his home on the outskirts of Panaji.

A few days later, he tested positive for the novel coronavirus forcing the state to grant him more time off. However, having subsequently recovered, the state has been urging him to rejoin the duty.

His wife, in the petition before the court, claimed that the health minister made a statement that Dr Edwin will be kept for Covid-19 duties until the pandemic is over as he is doing a good job.

“We will appreciate it if the meeting between Dr Gomes and the health secretary is held at the earliest and in any case, within a period of one week from today. We are sure that the initiative for this meeting will be taken by the health secretary and necessary intimation will be given to Dr Gomes and further, all assistance will also be rendered to Dr Gomes to attend this meeting through video conferencing,” the court said.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-s-hero-doctor-govt-spar-over-time-off-during-covid-19-court-seeks-amicable-solution/story-vtlwdhRt4FaheHFktmDatK.html,Covid,/Updated:Ghaziabad,Updated,Ghaziabad,2020-07-26 12:45:58+05:30,"Goa’s hero doctor, govt spar over time off during Covid-19; court seeks amicable solution"

34,6,"A district court in Gurugram has summoned Alibaba and its founder Jack Ma in a case in which a former employee in India says he was wrongfully fired after objecting to what he saw as censorship and fake news on company apps, documents seen by Reuters showed.

The case comes weeks after India cited security concerns in banning Alibaba's UC News, UC Browser and 57 other Chinese apps. Following the ban, which China has criticized, India sought written answers from all affected companies, including whether they censored content or acted for any foreign government.

In court filings dated July 20, the former employee of Alibaba's UC Web, Pushpandra Singh Parmar, alleges the company used to censor content seen as unfavourable to China and its apps UC Browser and UC News showcased false news “to cause social and political turmoil”.

Parmar, who worked as an associate director at the UC Web office in Gurugram until October 2017 and is seeking $268,000 in damages, referred Reuters queries to his lawyer, Atul Ahlawat, who declined to comment saying the matter was sub judice.

Also read: The Hindu Explains | What will be the impact of Chinese apps ban?

‘Sensitive words list’

In more than 200 pages of court filings, reviewed by Reuters, former employee Parmar included clippings of some posts showcased on the UC News app that he alleged were false. One post from 2017 was headlined in Hindi: “2,000-rupee notes to be banned from midnight today”. Another headline of a 2018 post said: “Just now: War broke out between India and Pakistan” and contained description of firing across the disputed border between the countries. Reuters could not independently verify the veracity of the claims in the court filing. India did not ban its 2,000-rupee currency note and no war occurred between India and Pakistan in 2018.

The lawsuit also contains a “sensitive words list” with key words in Hindi and English like “India-China border” and “Sino-India war” that the court filing alleges were used by UC Web to censor content on its platforms in India. “In order to control any news related content to be published against China was automatically/manually rejected by an audit system evolved for this purpose,” the filing said.

Civil Judge Sonia Sheokand has issued summons for Alibaba, Jack Ma and about a dozen individuals or company units, asking them to appear in court or through a lawyer on July 29, court documents showed. The judge has also sought written responses from the company and its executives within 30 days, according to the summons.

UC India said in a statement it had been “unwavering in its commitment to the India market and the welfare of its local employees, and its policies are in compliance with local laws. We are unable to comment on ongoing litigation”. Alibaba representatives did not respond to requests for comment from the Chinese company or on behalf of Jack Ma.

The court case is the latest hurdle for Alibaba in India after the Indian government's app ban, following which UC Web has started laying off some staff in India.

""Today is July 26th and it is a very special day - Kargil Vijay Diwas. 21 years ago our brave soldiers raised the flag of victory in Kargil,"" the Prime Minister said.

""Nobody can forget the way the Kargil war got underway, when Pakistan, to distract attention from its own domestic issues, provoked a war.""

""This happened at a time when India was trying to work for peace between the two countries. But the Indian army combated all this and we got a victory as the world watched in wonder,"" Mr. Modi said.

""I too had, at that time, the good fortune of visiting Kargil. I pay homage not only to our martyrs, but also the brave mothers who gave birth to these brave sons,"" he said.

Mr. Modi said the information of all gallantry award winners of the country is collated and can be accessed at www.galantryawards.gov.in

Reflecting on the words of former Prime Minister and BJP leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Mr. Modi said: ""What Atalji said from the ramparts of the Red Fort is still memorable today. He spoke of Mahatma Gandhi's talisman of thinking about your actions and how it will affect the life of the most opressed.""

Atalji added another bit to this talisman: ""Before any action, think whether it would add to the honour and respect of those who laid down their lives for the country,"" he said.

The Prime Minister asked the citizens to be more mindful of the honour of the soldiers posted in the border areas.

""Sometimes we post things on social media or forward things on phones without fully understanding that it hurts the morale of the people. Wars are not just fought on the borders. We have to decide which role we want to play,"" Mr. Modi said.

""Friends, all we say is that a war-like situation affects the morale of those posted at the borders. We must never forget this and be mindful that whatever we do and say should only add to the honour of our soldiers,"" he added.

'Inspirational work'

Mr. Modi said that the rural areas of the country have paved the way forward in terms of turning a crisis into an opportunity.

""We are in the midst of a crisis but people have also faced it with great fortitude and that is what converts crisis into opportunity,"" the Prime Minister said.

""Our rural areas have shown the way during the corona crisis. For example in Jammu, Balbir Kaur set up a 30 bed Corona centre and also carried a spray tank on her shoulders to undertake sanitisation,"" he added.

""Ganderbal's Jaituna Begum who distributed free masks and rations in her area, also distributed saplings of apple. Mohammed Iqbal of Anantnag made a low cost sprayer for ₹50,000. We hear of such inspirational work everyday,"" he said.

""In Bihar, women SHGs have started making masks out of fabric with Madhubani paintings. Craftsmen in Tripura and Manipur have made water bottles and tiffin boxes from bamboo... these are hardy, and being boiled in Neem before hand, are also hygienic."" the PM said.

Speaking of innovations that arose out of necessities, Mr. Modi referred to the examples of Ladakh, Kutch and Bihar.

""In Bihar a group of boys decided to cultivate pearls. They have now expanded to Muzzaffarpur, Begusarai and Patna, where people have returned home from other parts of the country,"" he said.

In Ladakh, the supply chains of apricot - a fruit that has the capacity to transform the economy of the area - are problematic. The innovation of a solar drier, a new machine that dries out the the fruit hygienically and without wastage has benefited them, he added.

""In Kutch, dragon fruit is being grown in an innovative manner,"" Mr. Modi said.

""When we think of something new and innovative, then impossible things become possible."" The PM remarked.

On the occasion of National Handloom Day on the 7th of August, PM Modi urged the citizens to use handloom products and also encourage others to do so. ""This will help our workers,"" he said.

Mr. Modi said with Raksha Bandhan around the corner, he saw many people speaking of ""vocal for local"" which was ""good.""

'Must keep up precautions'

Remarking that it was the monsoon season again, the Prime Minister requested the citizens to keep up their precautions, and 'keep away from other diseases' as well.

""The way the country has fought corona in the last few months that has allayed many fears. Our recovery rate is one of the highest and our death toll is also low but every life is precious,"" Mr. Modi said.

""We still need to observe all precautions and be mindful that corona is as grievous as it was. Wearing masks, maintaining hygiene and keeping physical distance are all important,"" he said.

Whenever you feel like removing your masks out of irritation, remember the corona warriors who wear PPEs for hours on end while serving us. As a citizen you will realise that we must keep up the precautions, he added.

On the upcoming Independence Day celebrations on August 15th, the Prime Minister said that it will be celebrated under very 'challenging circumstances'.

""I request the youngsters to defeat the corona pandemic and work towards an aatmanirbhar bharat,"" he said.

Flood relief work underway

Addressing the recent floods in Assam and other northern and northeastern States, Mr. Modi said that the country is standing with those affected.

""Floods have created havoc in many parts of the country. Many organsiations, and all governments are involved in the relief work. We all are standing with those affected by the floods,"" he said.

Small cities deliver big results

Interacting with students across the country, Mr. Modi said the board examination results highlighted that small cities are also becoming integral to the country.

""There was time when those in various sectors from art to sports, there was participation only from those who were in big cities and famous institutions, but the situation different now. The recent board results have shown many such examples,"" he said.

India-Suriname relations

""India and Suriname have had over a century of connections. Over 1/4th of their population is from India and one of its languages has major influences of Bhojpuri."" The Prime Minister said.

""Recently the new President Chandrikapersad Santokhi took his oath with vedic chants in the background and parts of his oath taking were also in Sanskrit. Its a matter of pride for all of us and we extend the felicitations on behalf of the people of India,"" he said.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mann-ki-baat-narendra-modi-pays-tribute-to-kargil-martyrs/article32195280.ece,Covid,/Said:Jaipur,Said,Jaipur,,Mann Ki Baat | Narendra Modi pays tribute to Kargil martyrs
36,8,"The story so far: To estimate the extent of infection in the community, scientists at the National Centre for Disease Control (formerly National Institute for Communicable Diseases), a Health Ministry body tasked with monitoring epidemics, conducted a district-wise serological survey across Delhi from June 27 to July 10. Preliminary findings showed that 23.48% of Delhi’s population had been exposed to the virus and that a large number of those infected were asymptomatic.

How was the Delhi sero-prevalence survey done?

Unlike the real time RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) tests or antigen tests that scan for the presence of the coronavirus in the body, the sero-prevalence survey was designed to look for the presence of antibodies, produced in response to the coronavirus, in the blood. On an average, antibodies can be detected five days after an infection sets in. The coronavirus, in general, diminishes after 21 days. Antibodies, for a host of other viral infections, are normally expected to linger for many months and confer protection against fresh infections by the same virus. However, it is still too early in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 to know how long the antibodies will last.

Also read | Delhi’s COVID-19 sero-prevalence study: significant proportion of population still vulnerable

According to health experts, because the actual virus withers away quickly, many of those infected show mild symptoms. Antigen and PCR tests are often cumbersome to be widely deployed in the field and are not always the best way to estimate the spread of the virus. After the Indian Council of Medical Research led a multi-institutional study in May to estimate national sero-prevalence using the Kavach-ELISA antibody-detection kit, developed and tested in India, the government decided to do a similar study across Delhi. In June, the city was grappling with a high number of cases and several parts of the city were locked into containment zones.

What did the survey find?

Nearly 22,000 samples were collected from 11 districts. It emerged that on average, 23.48% of Delhi had been exposed to the virus. A large number of those infected were asymptomatic. Like in all statistical surveys, extrapolating the results from a sliver of a population to an entire city comes with its own caveats. Generally, those who commission such surveys report their findings in a peer-reviewed journal and detail, for instance, how accurate the test was in picking up infections and the error margins in extrapolating the results to a population. No such details were made available, so the announcement that nearly a quarter of Delhi’s 20 million population had been exposed to the virus is at best only suggestive.

A lot of the samples were collected from Delhi’s densest pockets so the extent of variation of infection in less populated parts of Delhi is not known. The Delhi government has said it will keep repeating these surveys at periodic intervals to gauge the spread of the infection. The survey found that nearly eight of the 11 districts had a sero-prevalence exceeding 20%. To the Delhi government, the fact that after six months of the global pandemic there was a 23% spread was indicative of the effect of lockdown and containment zone management. But the government also cautioned that the survey showed 77% of the population to be vulnerable to the infection; therefore, measures such as masks, hygiene, social distancing ought to be strictly adhered to.

Also read | Survey on antibodies against COVID-19 to be conducted every month: Delhi Health Minister

Another way to look at serology surveys is to compare the number of RT-PCR positive cases and the number of those who were infected as per their antibody profiles. Thus assuming that 50 lakh (or 25% as per this survey) were infected and comparing that to only about 100,000 who were confirmed positive, it appears that a PCR test caught only about 1 in 50 who are infected by the virus. This undermines claims by the Delhi government of its ability to contain infection spread. However, missing a sizeable proportion of those infected by the coronavirus is par for the course given that it spreads rapidly and leaves a large proportion of those afflicted with only mild (and frequently unreported) symptoms.

How reliable are serology surveys?

While it is routine in epidemiology to deploy antibody tests to estimate the prevalence of a disease, the sheer speed of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the global nature of the disease have complicated the matter. Generally, they take a while to develop and are tested in the field before being deployed in large numbers. This is done to rule out errors such as the test marking the wrong antibodies, or an inappropriate sample that does not represent a population being chosen. Such problems hindered an early plan by the ICMR to use China-manufactured antibody kits in April and May to gauge infection spread. The ICMR is still to publish details of its May serosurvey that estimated 0.73% of the population in 63 surveyed districts to be infected. For COVID-19, the reliability of such surveys still rests on nascent science.",https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/the-hindu-explains-what-are-the-implications-of-the-delhi-sero-survey-findings/article32192834.ece,Covid,/Centre:Mumbai,Centre,Mumbai,,The Hindu Explains | What are the implications of the Delhi sero-survey findings?
