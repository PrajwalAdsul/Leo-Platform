0,1,"For some high-fliers the party hasn’t stopped despite the coronavirus pandemic. A Hyderabad jeweller who threw a lavish birthday bash attended by at least 100 people died of COVID-19 on Saturday. This is not the first such event, since India began unlocking.
In Bihar, a wedding ceremony in rural Patna on June 15 set off the biggest coronavirus infection chain so far, and the groom was among those who died while around a 100 were infected.
In May, a Hyderabad shop owner threw a party after which 45 tested positive in May.
 
In Tamil Nadu, a DMK man who organised a bash for his birthday in Thiruvallur district on June 14 has tested positive for Coronavirus along with three guests.
It may be recalled, singer Kanika Kapoor’s Lucknow party in March exposed several to the coronavirus.
Why are people finding it so difficult to act in accordance with containment demands? Don’t they realise how their actions can affect others?
These are classic examples of the misplaced belief that ‘Nothing will happen to me’. Sanjay Gulabani, chairman, P. Mangatram Jewellers, says,
 
“Each one of us needs to act responsibly. For the economy to not get further beaten out of shape, the lockdown was relaxed. The purpose of the lockdown was to create awareness and get people ready to adapt to the new codes. It is up to us to be judicious in protecting our health,” he pointed out.
“There was general carelessness and apathy towards the problem,” feels Uday Pilani, entrepreneur and investor, who owns hotels in the UK, as well as the FinTech and Management Consulting company in India.
“The Agarwal Marwadi Samaj now has over a thousand affected. The thing is that the recovery rate is excellent, so they are losing fear,” he adds.
 
It’s been difficult to curb the jet-setting crowd from organising parties and society events. “Now is not the time to show your status; it’s time to show responsibility. The vast majority of the people who are defying calls for social distancing are not realising that it’s not about just them... it’s about taking a risk with their families and friends as well. It’s time we all get responsible and accept that precaution is better than cure,” says Madhu Jain, an entrepreneur.
While the world’s scientists are working towards finding a cure and vaccines for COVID-19, we need to take all preventive measures, feels Bina Mehta, another entrepreneur.
 
“Social distancing will only ‘flatten the curve’. Let us all understand and respect our own lives and value others’ lives too. It is a sin to invite people to events, and an even bigger sin to be part of any event,” says Bina.
Life doesn’t have to stop because of the Coronavirus, but it’s smart to re-evaluate priorities, feels entrepreneur Vinod Ranka,. “I was invited to few parties and weddings, but I declined the invitations,” he says, giving an example of how priorities should change.

Neil Pate
 
The coronavirus crisis has crumpled the social fabric of our lives and the fashion industry like. Be it the way we address our financial goals or the way we dress.
Even as fashion titans like Louis Vuitton, Prada, Gucci and some Indian designers are casting their bread upon the waters to create safe and sustainable clothing (including PPE), the most that we can do is wait. And watch!
Fashion historians point out that people changed their dressing style after the 1918 Flu Pandemic, the Great Depression and World War II. The 2020 Covid-19 pandemic is no exception.
 
With retailers and clothing units shutting shop, and millions of workers scrambling to make ends meet, nobody frankly knows the future of fashion or the new ‘quarantrends’.
A la Mode
Some designers say dressier days are on the horizon as people would want to spread cheer and positive vibes. Some opine dull and somber attire goes with the current mood. Yet, a few others are optimistic of the easy-on-the-eye-and-pocket florals.
The online market of second-hand and recycled clothes, shoes and accessories has already seen a spike. You may nod and naff in equal measure, but it looks like Back to Basics!
 
Ritu Kumar, the doyenne of Indian fashion industry, who began her career in 1969 with just four hand block printers and two tables in a small village near Calcutta (now Kolkata), says that there were recessionary trends in the fashion industry even before the pandemic.
“Business had slowed down after demonetisation. Now, there will be a trend of need-based buying. I won’t be surprised if we are pushed back by another 20 years,” says Kumar, whose understanding of ancient Indian designs, traditional crafts and Indian fashion market is unmatched.
 
She adds that you cannot compare the Indian fashion industry to the international ones. “The fashion industry in the western world has been there for over 100-150 years. The Indian fashion industry has been around for only 30-40 years.”
However, Kumar feels the saree, kurta and kurtis will make a comeback to beat the corona blues. “A saree suits all occasions. It is low on maintenance too. Men usually spend on branded shirts and trousers. But now people will move towards ethnic wear. The kurta will be the much-favoured choice for men and women,” she says.
 
Beleaguered Workforce
India has an estimated 16 million crafts-people working in the textile industry.  A majority of them in rural areas and are involved in the most intricate work like weaving, embroidery and creation of embellishments etc.
These craftsmen have mastered their craft over centuries and passed it on from one generation to the other. The pandemic has brought about an “unprecedented” crisis.
Today, thousands of craftsmen are without work. Customers are still hesitant to enter malls and shops to buy clothes although there has been a spike in online shopping.
 
Jugnu Gosrani, a Mumbai-based designer, who creates free-spirited clothes, says all her sales are online.
“We are all saddled with unsold merchandise. This month, I managed to sell kurtis, dresses and skirts online in my housing society itself. Customers order online. I leave the outfit outside their door in a sealed plastic bag,” explains Jugnu. She is certain that people will stick to affordable and sustainable clothes.
The only ‘In thing’ right now are protective masks. Jeans, joggers and leggings are also in demand. Whether you step out to run errands or go for a jog. The mask is here to stay for a long time. “I’m making kalamkari masks from the leftover fabrics,” Jugnu adds.
 
No Big Spenders  
Designer Rina Dhaka feels it is impossible to quantify the losses since it is interlinked from retail giants to exporters to the migrant workers. “Work is a struggle and one is trying to get up again,” she says.
After the pandemic, Rina plans to move back to crafts, wovens and sustainable models of fashion. “I will also simplify the couture. Maybe more as singles or separates to make the spending easier,” she says.  
Grapevine from the fashion circuit tells us that nearly four designers and their loved ones have had a close brush with the virus. Earlier, designers had to run the gauntlet of TV cameras and fashion photographers.
 
Now, it will take plenty of pluck to re-fashion one’s business model and pull through the mess. The Fashion Design Council of India has already announced a Covid-19 Support Fund for small businesses and young designers in need.
Ritu Kumar is certain that fast fashion will be out. “In India, people purchase clothes for functions and festivals (Diwali, Eid, Christmas, Baisakhi) unlike the west where the fashion ramp is dictated by changing seasons and colours.” Kumar is optimistic that people will bounce back. “We will have to focus on ‘Make in India’ to pull through this crisis,” she says.  
 
Make Every Outfit Count
Today, millions of people are either out of work or have taken pay cuts. The recession has forced people to set their priorities and rethink their spending.  Nishit Gupta, director of KALKI says people are tired of this panic mode.
“Fashion trends will vary as the world slowly emerges from the global quarantine. With weddings now becoming more intimate, smaller in size, the fusion trends will find favour with both brides and bridesmaids. Mirror lehengas, organza skirts, pre-stitched sarees, necklet gowns, dhoti-crop tops in handwoven fabrics and hand-done embroideries with traditional textile techniques will trend. It will also help support the rural artisans and handloom communities,” says Nishit.
 
The pandemic shockwaves have hit every industry. The ‘new normal’ will make us slow down, and reinvent how we view consumption and production.
“If you view forecasts, by next year from a slated -4% drop this year in the GDP, we may be able to achieve a growth of 4% in 2021, provided we take control of the production and job creation by being self sufficient,” says Bahaar Dhawan Rohatgi, a Delhi-based lawyer-cum-visual artist and influencer.
She hopes the fashion sector will become more responsible and sustainable.
 
“I hope aficionados will promote products that employ environmental-friendly, fair practices, minimise waste and boast functionality. We may witness a tipping point where designers will be drawn to celebrate austerity, emphasising a classless society (remember post war ‘Austerity Britain drive’ in the 1940s) signifying affordability, access to leisure, health, value life and maintaining balance,” says Bahaar. Perhaps need-based sustainable dressing is the glamour we’ve been missing!

2,20,"Hyderabad: Every time a question is asked about the Telangana government’s management of the COVID-19 pandemic, or when uncomfortable queries are raised about the disease data that it reports, the state’s Health Department wraps itself tighter in its cloak of secrecy.

Over the past four months, several changes have been made to the daily COVID-19 bulletin, be it relating to testing, number of cases, or the number of people ‘discharged’ (the government still does not explain in the bulletin how many of those ‘discharged’ daily are actually ‘cured’).

And on Saturday evening, the very home page of the Telangana Government’s health department went offline. Attempts to get to the website http://health.telangana.gov.in/ were met with a message: ‘The requested service is temporarily unavailable. It is either overloaded or under maintenance. Please try later.’

Deccan Chronicle first reported on Saturday morning that an associated webpage of this site -- http://124.124.103.93/COVID/statistics.htm -- which provides real-time updates on COVID-19 cases in across the state, disappeared from the online world. And by evening, the home page of the health department itself disappeared.

It was this website -- http://124.124.103.93/COVID/statistics.htm -- that was in the middle of a serious controversy in the first week of July when it was discovered that the number of COVID-19 cases displayed on the website was vastly different from the ones released every day in the COVID-19 bulletin by the health department. The question was about the two very different sets of data, with the bulletin showing a nearly 3,000 difference with the website showing a higher number.

The difference in numbers instantly became controversial with not just the reports on it shared very widely on social media platforms but with opposition political parties jumping on the issue and claiming that this issue yet again highlighted the lackadaisical approach of the Telangana government to COVID-19 control and management.

The health department subsequently claimed that the numbers on the website were not added to the COVID-19 bulletins owing to confusion over the validity of tests conducted by some private labs that showed ‘abnormal’ rates of disease positivity. There were also official claims that the bulletin has a cut-off time of cases reported till 5 p.m. while the website reflected live updates.

However, the website where live updates could be checked has since been taken down as has the homepage from where the page on ‘statistics’ could be accessed.

The website of the health department – health.telangana.gov.in – when last checked and found functional on Friday evening, showed a link ‘COVID-19’ with the word ‘New’ blinking next to it. It was upon clicking on this COVID-19 link that one would be taken to the website – 124.124.103.93/COVID/home.htm – which displayed a tab that said ‘statistics’. However, this tab was never activated but by substituting the word ‘home’, with ‘statistics’ in the webpage’s url, one could access the statistics page with regular updates on COVID-19 numbers in Telangana.

As on Friday evening, the ‘COVID-19’ link on the ‘health.telangana.gov.in’ was no longer active and clicking on it took a person to a page that says ‘the requested resource in not available,’ instead of the page with the url 124.124.103.93/COVID/home.htm, that was the home page for the ‘Department of Health & Family Welfare, Government of Telangana, COVID-19’ which also displayed a picture of chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao and health minister Etala Rajendar.",https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/110720/telangana-takes-down-covid-19-data-site.html,Covid,/Chandrashekar:Hyderabad,Chandrashekar,Hyderabad,2020-07-11 19:49:00+05:30

4,32,"Police officers who shot dead gangster Vikas Dubey are fed laddus by 'bystanders' outside the Lajpat Rai Hospital in Kanpur on Friday, July 10,2020. (PTI)

Kanpur: If the killing of gangster Vikas Dubey followed the long-standing template of a ‘police encounter’, the aftermath too has followed a script developed in recent years for such purposes. In Kanpur, outside the mortuary where the gangster’s body was taken after his killing on the road from Ujjain, police officers were fed laddus and showered with petals, an observance that was first invented in Hyderabad when police killed three men who allegedly had raped a veterinary doctor.

At the crematorium where Vikas Dube’s body was reduced to ashes, even his wife said her husband had been “wrong” and deserved ""this fate"". But then Richa Dube also lashed out at mediapersons, holding them responsible for the death of her husband.

Dubey was shot dead Friday morning by the UP police who claimed he tried to flee when the car carrying him from Ujjain overturned on an isolated stretch of the highway on the outskirts of the city. Dubey had allegedly masterminded the killing of eight policemen on July 2 when they went to arrest him at his village Bikru.

The killing has been described by civil rights groups and opposition political parties as a murder by the police.

A large number of policemen were there at Dubey’s final rites in Kanpur, apparently to maintain security. Superintendent of police (rural) Brijesh Srivastava told reporters that the gangster’s brother-in-law Dinesh Tiwari performed the last rites at the electric crematorium in the presence of Vikas Dubey’s wife and son.

Emerging from the crematorium, Richa Dubey looked agitated and said, “Yes, yes, yes. Vikas did wrong and he deserved this fate.”

After the last rites, policewomen took Richa and her son in their vehicle to an undisclosed location. No police official was ready to say whether or not they were let off later.

Earlier, Vikas's father Ram Kumar Dubey too distanced himself from the gangster and justified police action. “Whatever the police did was right,” he had said and declared that he would not attend the last rites.

Dubey's other relatives and neighbours too did not turn up for the cremation despite police urgings.

In Vikas Dube’s village of Bikru, there was eerie silence outside the demolished house of the gangster. About 60 policemen were posted to the site after news broke that he had been killed in an encounter.

The house was demolished by the Kanpur district administration on Saturday. The policemen sat on bed stands under a Neem tree and responded to media personnel’s questions with stony silence.

The house is around 18 km from Chaubeypur police station, where a new station officer has taken over after all the policemen posted there were shunted out after the Vikas Dubey gang ambushed and killed eight cops who went to arrest him.

The new SHO, however, politely refused to speak.

Locating Dubey's house was not very difficult as everybody in neighbouring villages knows by now where the dreaded criminal lived in the area. They were willing to tell the direction.

But, the scene at Dubey's village Bikru was quite opposite: people remained indoors and refused to speak about him and the killing of eight cops he was alleged to have masterminded.

Dubey was accused of masterminding an ambush at his Bikru village on the night of July 2. Eight policemen, including DSP Devendra Mishra, were killed, triggering a manhunt for him.

Madhya Pradesh police arrested him in Ujjain. He was being brought back to Kanpur by UP police, who claim they shot him when he tried to escape.",https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/crime/110720/true-to-encounter-script-vikas-dubeys-wife-says-he-deserved-his-fate.html,Riot,/Ujjain:Hyderabad,Ujjain,Hyderabad,2020-07-11 10:33:00+05:30

A team of Juhu ATS, headed by Daya Nayak, arrested the duo from Kolshet area. The accused duo is wanted in several crimes and was part of a sensational murder of a UP politician in 2001.

The ATS began the operation after the Juhu unit received specific information on the accused duo, later identified as Guddan Trivedi alias Arvind (46) and his driver Sonu Tiwari alias Sushilkumar (30).

The duo had been hiding in the Kolshet area in Thane and Trivedi was also allegedly part of the cop massacre killing eight officials, including a deputy superintendent of police, in Kanpur.

“The accused persons had fled after the murder of the policemen at Bikru village on July 3. His preliminary questioning hinted towards his involvement in the murder of the politician Santosh Mishra in 2001 and many other crimes,” said an ATS officer.

The officials said that the detailed questioning will be conducted by the UP police and all cooperation will be extended to them by the ATS. The officials are in the process of seeking clarity on the activities of the accused after they fled Kanpur.

The two accused will be handed over to the UP Special Task Force (STF) and a team is on their way to take custody of the duo.

Maharashtra reported just 6,603 fresh cases as COVID-19 cases in Mumbai’s Dharavi come under control. However, Maharashtra still has the highest number of total cases – 2, 23, 724 — and highest numbers of deaths – 9448 out of which 198 were on Wednesday.

Delhi registered 2033 new cases and 48 deaths taking its total number of infected to 1, 04, 864 and 3218 deaths.

However, as cases pick up in Bihar, the state government has decided to put Patna, Bhagalpur and some other places under lockdown from July 9 to 16 during which only essential services shops will be allowed to remain open.

Economist Prof Steve Hanke of Johns Hopkins University has pointed out that higher cases in India are due to lack of medical infrastructure and under testing.

The cumulative number of samples tested, as of now is 1,04,73,771. As a result, the tests per million today stand at 7180,” said health ministry officials.

The mapping and analysis of people moving in public places, apparently, has been a big help for the government machinery in its containment measures initiated for the fast-spreading disease.

2,5,"Karimul Haque’s house in Jalpaiguri’s Dhalabari village was a flurry of activity when two men came looking for him one sunny June morning. Haque was busy overseeing breakfast preparations for some 200 people — a new normal for his family during the pandemic.

The two brothers said their mother, Gyaneshwari Rai, an asthma patient, had died in their sister’s house some 15 km away, and they were not able to get her body back for the last rites. Everyone had turned their backs on the family, fearing the septuagenarian had died of COVID-19. With no transport, not even an ambulance, their only hope was Haque, the ‘Bike Ambulance Dada’.

Within hours, Haque had sped off on his bike ambulance with its customised hospital cot attached as a side-car, and had brought the body to the Rais’ house for the final rites and cremation. “We were not with her when she passed away,” said Bhim, one of the deceased woman’s sons. “The least we could do was send her off with dignity, with full Hindu rites as she would have wished. Thanks to Karim-da, we could perform our final duty towards our mother.”

Lifelong pursuit

Ferrying people to and from the hospital on his motorbike has been Haque’s pursuit for many years now. His ailing pillion riders live in far-flung places, tea gardens and villages in forests that are often not connected to roads; marginalised people who would have remained without access to healthcare if not for Haque’s free transport. One phone call and he sets off on his TVS 110cc. In the past 20 years, he has helped, by his estimate, close to 5,500 people, a feat for which he was awarded the Padma Shri in 2017.

Haque lost his mother, in 1995, due to the lack of transport. “She suffered a heart attack at midnight, but we could not take her to the hospital,” he says. “We watched helplessly as she passed away by dawn.” Four years later, at the tea garden where he worked part-time, a co-worker fell ill. Haque borrowed his manager’s bike and took him to hospital. “To be able to save a life is heartening,” he says. Slowly, he began ferrying the sick to hospital on his cycle or in cycle-rickshaws. In 2007, he borrowed ₹7,000 from his neighbour to buy a second-hand motorbike and continued the job. Two years later, he took a bank loan to finance a TVS110.

In 2016, Bajaj gifted him a bike with a side car. Now, thanks to donations, he also owns two regular four-wheel ambulances for which patients pay a minimal fare to meet fuel costs. The bike, however, which Haque himself rides, is a free service.

Standing together

Just from experience, after dealing with patients for so many years, and from interactions with doctor acquaintances, Haque, a school drop-out, has trained himself to conduct basic examinations such as measuring temperature and blood pressure and giving first aid. Now, in these times of the pandemic, his calling continues uninterrupted. It has, in fact, brought new responsibilities for Haque. “We have to be more careful and take all precautions,” he says, when asked about the stigma that led to Gyaneshwari Rai being abandoned. “But this is not the time to abandon our friends and relatives. We have to stand by each other.”

Last month, the Jalpaiguri zilla parishad appointed him the district’s health ambassador for COVID-19 as part of its public awareness programme at the grassroots level. This means Haque must travel to villages along with panchayat representatives, civic police volunteers and ASHA workers and interact with local people. He tells them about the novel coronavirus, and what they should and should not do. “I try to dispel myths; I tell them to be governed by science and science alone,” says Haque.

Since the lockdown was announced, Haque has been distributing food and rations to the poor and the now unemployed migrant workers returning from other places. With the help of donations, Haque provides dry rations to around 1,000 people and cooked meals to 200 quarantined migrant workers. He has hired people to cook at his own house.

Haque, his sons, and some 35 relatives who live in the neighbourhood, have all come together in this endeavour. “We have a core team of 10-12 cousins who do most of the legwork, while father oversees everything,” says Raju, Haque’s elder son, who also helps in the ambulance service. “It feels like the family has suddenly become bigger.”

Haque gets generous financial backing from both NRIs and locals. Kazi Iqbal Hussain, a Kuwait-based businessman and philanthropist with roots in West Bengal, has donated ₹2 lakh for a clinic that Haque has begun constructing near his house, as well as over ₹4 lakh towards pandemic relief work. The U.S.-based Kalyan Debnath, an aviation sector professional, and his brother Rabi, have donated ₹1.75 lakh for the hospital and supplied Haque with dry rations, sanitary napkins, hand sanitisers, masks, gloves, and more.

“It is the donors who are the main force, helping me help thousands of needy people,” says Haque. “I’m only a foot soldier.”

2,14,"The health department will have a dedicated COVID care centre for pregnant women: Himanta Biswa Sarma

The Assam government would allow non-symptomatic COVID-19 positive patients to go for home quarantine only if they sign an undertaking agreeing to certain conditions, Health and Family Welfare Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Saturday.

Such patients have to ensure that their neighbours and housing societies have no objection to their home quarantine, there are no elderly persons in the family and they have a private physician to check their health condition every three hours, he said.

Besides, they need to have a pulse oximeter at home and should be able to reach in personal vehicle to a hospital, in case their condition deteriorates, Mr Sarma told a press conference.

""The health department does not prefer home quarantine as there is a risk of transmitting the disease to others in the house, particularly elderly persons and children. We also want to ensure that all COVID-19 patients will be available for timely treatment"", he said.

The social set-up in Assam is such that usually ""three generations live together in a house and if the patient is not isolated, there are chances that the patient may infect 10 others"", he said.

""There are, however, constant requests from patients for home quarantine and though they have the freedom of choice but we cannot allow them to infect others. We can allow it only if they fulfill these conditions"", he added.

Flight passengers coming to Guwahati will now be subjected to COVID-19 Antigen test at the airport and those testing negative will be allowed to go for home quarantine for 14 days, the minister said.

""It has also come to our notice that private hospitals are not admitting patients without COVID test, though we had asked them to set up testing facilities and except for a few, most have not done so resulting in an increase in the morbidity and mortality rate"", he said.

Therefore, in the case of critical patients needing immediate hospitalisation ""we have decided that their results will be processed within 24 hours, provided the samples are received prior to 12 noon each day"", Mr Sarma said.

The health department will also have a dedicated COVID care centre for pregnant women, and children below the age of 12 and a Geriatric Covid Centre for senior citizens above the age of 65 where round the clock doctors and nurses will be available, he said.

He said that all deaths where COVID-19 is the underlying cause will be certified by a Death Audit Board according to the guidelines of the Indian Council Medical Research (ICMR).

Following the increase in the number of deaths, an aggressive line of treatment with steroids and plasma therapy has been initiated at the Guwahati Medical College Hospital with patients showing signs of improvement, Mr Sarma said.

The situation in Guwahati city, which has reported 6,221 positive cases till date, was still critical and ""COVID-19 is still very active but we have been able to bring down the positivity rate to 21 per cent from the 30 per cent when the lockdown was imposed"", he said.

Veteran star Rekha’s security guard tested positive for novel coronavirus on Tuesday. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) moved him to the Bandra jumbo facility soon after and also conducted tests of all the other staff members employed at her bungalow. All staff members of her neighbour and lyricist Javed Akhtar’s bungalow have also been tested for Covid-19.

While Rekha’s bungalow has not been sealed, the portion of the compound which housed the staff has been sealed.

A civic official, who did not wish to be named, said Rekha did not want BMC to test her. She informed the body that she will get a test done on her own and submit the report to them.

Earlier, Karan Johar and Janhvi Kapoor’s staff members had also tested positive for Covid-19 during the lockdown. The two families had undergone tests for novel coronavirus but were found negative.

Meanwhile, veteran actor Amitabh Bachchan and his son Abhishek Bachchan tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday. The senior actor was admitted to the Nanavati hospital for treatment.

He himself took to Twitter to ask all those who came in his vicinity in the late 10 days to get themselves tested as well. He tweeted late Saturday, “I have tested CoviD positive .. shifted to Hospital .. hospital informing authorities .. family and staff undergone tests , results awaited .. All that have been in close proximity to me in the last 10 days are requested to please get themselves tested !”

The 77-year-old actor has been associated with different campaigns and has also been raising awareness about coronavirus for a long time. He also featured in a short film titled Family which encourages viewers to not step out of their homes unnecessarily amid coronavirus pandemic.

Aishwarya Rai,46, and daughter Aaradhya Bachchan, 8, tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday afternoon, hours after the two were reported to have tested negative for the virus. Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar was quoted as saying that the actor and her daughter had tested negative but the results came otherwise within hours.

As per BMC, Aishwarya and Aaradhya’s swab samples were taken for RT-PCR test on Saturday. Their positive reports came on Sunday. So here’s why they tested negative earlier: Just like reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), rapid antigen test detects the presence of molecular pathogens of coronavirus in people. But unlike RT-PCR which takes almost 8 hours to provide results, the latter gives reports within 30 minutes. The antigen-based test uses nasal swab samples for testing. According to protocol, every positive report from the rapid antigen testing is treated as ‘true positive’, while negative samples are mandatorily re-tested by RT-PCR process.

So, when the test reports of Aishwarya and Aaradhya came negative in rapid antigen tests at the hospital on Saturday, their samples were taken for RT-PCR test. On Sunday, their RT-PCR results came positive.

Balaji Telefilms, producers of Kasautii Zindagii Kay, said in a statement, “We would like to inform various stakeholders that one of our talent from the show Kasautii Zindagii Kay has tested positive for COVID-19 and is now receiving medical attention. Our first priority is to help protect our talent, production crew and employees. We are taking all the precautions detailed in the guideline.

Ekta Kapoor of Balaji Telefilms shared the production house’s statement on her Instagram stories and wrote, “All necessary precautions being taken, SOPs being followed. Health & safety comes first to us all at Balaji. Take care. Jai Mata Di!”

SpotboyeE reports that Parth underwent a test after experiencing symptoms on Saturday morning. He was not present for the shoot on Sunday. His Kasautii Zindagii Kay co-stars Pooja Banerjee (who plays Nivedita Basu) and Shubhavi Choksey (who plays Mohini Basu) are on the set and have been asked to undergo tests. Officials of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation have already arrived. Pooja told the website, “Yes there is test happening and I’m on set right now.”

Parth, who flew to Hyderabad once domestic flight services resumed, returned to Mumbai to resume the Kasautii Zindagii Kay shoot last month. The show also stars Erica Fernandes, Karan Patel and Pooja Banerjee, among others.

Earlier this month, Parth opened up on experiencing ‘moments of depression’ during the lockdown and thanked his friends, fans and well-wishers for helping him overcome the low phase. “Yes there were moments of depression and sadness during this lockdown, but that’s what gives us strength to be stronger and push ourselves so that one day when this pandemic is over .. We are Ready !!! To face this world againnnn !!!!,” he wrote in an Instagram post.

Parth has acted in shows such as Best Friends Forever? and Kaisi Yeh Yaariyaan. He also announced earlier this year that he will play a gangster in the ALT Balaji web series Mai Hero Boll Raha Hu.
