0,0,"Rio De Janeiro: Rarely have two words ignited such a firestorm of controversy.
""So what?"" said Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro on Tuesday when a journalist asked him about the fact that more than 5,000 Brazilians had died of the coronavirus.
 
The far-right leader's off-the-cuff comment has been sparking anger ever since, with governors, politicians, healthcare professionals and media figures all weighing in to express their outrage at his lack of empathy.
Bolsonaro is no stranger to controversy. But his latest remark sparked such a fury because Brazil is facing a seemingly uncontrollable outbreak of the disease and is still several weeks away from the peak of the pandemic, with a death toll that threatens to surpass even the most dire predictions.
There have been more than 91,000 officially confirmed cases so far but scientists warn the real figure could be 15 to 20 times higher.
With a death toll that has already topped 6,300, the giant South American country is facing as grim a scenario as Italy or the United States.
""So what? I'm sorry. What do you want me to do?"" Bolsonaro said Tuesday when questioned about his country passing the 5,000-death mark, more than China. He joked that even though his middle name is Messias, or Messiah, ""I don't do miracles.""
Wilson Witzel, the governor of Rio de Janeiro state, called the president's remarks ""absolutely unacceptable.""
With his own state on the verge of a public health meltdown, Witzel slammed the president for ""being ironic about the deaths"" rather than ""being a leader at such a moment.""
""Do your job,"" he said on Twitter Wednesday, the day when the pro-gun president was training at a target range, far from the woes of Brazil's 210 million citizens.
'Brasilia bubble'
Joao Doria, governor of Sao Paulo state which is also on the frontlines of the battle against the coronavirus with more than 2,500 deaths already, replied furiously to Bolsonaro in the capital Brasilia.
""Get out of your Brasilia bubble,"" he retorted, urging Bolsonaro to visit hospitals ""in this country which is crying for its dead and infected.""
Unlike many other heads of state, the Brazilian leader has not been seen in any hospitals nor has he expressed much solidarity with victims of the disease, bereaved families or healthcare staff who have condemned the lack of ventilators or beds.
The head of the doctors' union in Sao Paulo, Eder Gatti, called on television for ""a more serious attitude from the president of the republic.""
Bolsonaro ""shows very little sensitivity to the tragedies that the families of those directly affected by the pandemic are going through,"" said Lucio Renno, director of the Institute of Political Science at Brasilia University.
""His style is the iron fist, to be hard rather than to show solidarity or empathy,"" he told AFP.
It is a style that inevitably draws comparison with Bolsonaro's own role model, US President Donald Trump.
That type of reaction is ""shocking for a large part of the population"" and ""reinforces the idea for a good part of the elites and for the Brazilian people that he is not fit to govern,"" Renno said.
Miriam Leitao, an op-ed writer at the daily O Globo, wrote on Thursday that with his ""So what?"" Bolsonaro had ""renounced the presidency.""
""Anyone who shows such contempt for his own people can no longer be president,"" she wrote.
'Judged by history'
In a tactic he has honed since becoming president, Bolsonaro quickly went on the offensive in the face of criticism from the governors and mayors, whom the Supreme Court has granted the power to call the shots in the fight against the pandemic.
""Ask Joao Doria or (Bruno) Covas [the mayor of Sao Paulo] why people continue to die even when they have taken such restrictive measures,"" said the president.
""They are the ones who should have the answers, you can't pin that on me.""
Nevertheless the press on Friday blamed the spike in infections and death on Bolsonaro, who has encouraged people to go out to work to prevent an economic crash and whose most fervent supporters have taken to the streets to protest against lockdown orders.
Bolsonaro's ""So what?"" has ""underscored how little importance he has attached to the situation,"" said political analyst Andre Pereira Cesar.
""If the president does not assume a wartime leadership stance against the virus he will be judged harshly -- by history and by voters,"" he warned.

1,1,"Friends and foes
BJP leader Subramanian Swamy and TV news anchor Arnab Goswami have little in common but they have had a blow-cold-blow-hot relationship with Sonia Gandhi. In 1998-99, when Sonia formally entered politics and Goswami was a beat reporter with a prominent TV news channel, he was often spotted at 24, Akbar Road, or outside 10, Janpath. On one occasion, Sonia stopped abruptly to give Goswami a soundbite, a first for any news channel. For months Goswami gushed and seldom missed an opportunity to say “hi” to madam. In 2014, he managed a long interview with Rahul Gandhi, which subsequently damaged Rahul’s reputation as a serious politician. Congress sources insist the interview materialised, courtesy Priyanka Gandhi who offered Goswami “chai-pakoda” during the rainy season at her New Delhi residence. Goswami’s recent diatribe against Sonia, therefore, surprised and shocked 10, Janpath.
 
Subramnian Swamy has been both friend and foe to both Sonia and Goswami. Swamy teamed up with Sonia and Jayalalithaa to bring down the Atal Behari Vajpayee regime and caused irreparable damage to his rapport with both ladies. Incidentally, along with Raj Thackeray, Swamy holds the distinction of taming Goswami on air. When Republic TV was launched, Swamy wrote to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting taking exception to the usage 'Republic' for a commercial venture by Arnab. Swamy said that under the Emblems and Names Act, 1950, certain names and emblems such as 'Republic' are prohibited from use for professional and commercial purposes.
Manmohan dazed?
Sonia Gandhi has set up a consultative panel to respond to Narendra Modi government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. However, Dr Manmohan Singh, who confers with Rahul Gandhi, P. Chidambaram, Jairam Ramesh and other members of the panel, is finding the video-conference meetings problematic. Often, he misses out on what others are saying. Panel members say the former prime minister looks dazed. But wife Gursharan Kaur insists Manmohan looks forward to the meeting every day.
Shivraj’s dubious choices
The recent Cabinet expansion conducted by Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan disappointed many. About a dozen BJP hopefuls had reportedly parked themselves in Bhopal even though the state capital was a coronavirus hotspot. There were reports that the state garage requisitioned 12 cars but the move was shelved and only five ministers made it. Three former state health ministers, Narottam Mishra, Tulsi Silawat and Kamal Patel (he was minister in charge of medical education), made it without anyone asking why the MP health infrastructure was so weak. The three BJP ministers are not considered personally loyal to Chouhan while the two Jyotiraditya Scindia loyalists are non-MLAs. Given the uncertainly over the coronavirus, many wonder how Chouhan would ensure Assembly by-polls within six months. MP does not have a second house or legislative council.
Mishra has in the past been accused of “paid news” during the 2008 Assembly polls. The Election Commission unanimously asked for Mishra’s disqualification but the Delhi high Court set aside the disqualification.
Varun’s dream
For the discerning viewer, Varun Gandhi’s Twitter timeline showering fulsome praise on prime minister Narendra Modi’s handling of the coronavirus crisis is not without significance. Varun tries to draw Modi’s attention at a time when the buzz is that Jyotiraditya Scindia is set to join the Union cabinet. A Gandhi surname and a series of uninterrupted electoral successes have not bolstered Varun’s chances in the Modi government even though his mother is no longer a minister. Is the PM paying attention to Varun’s subtext? Doesn't appear so.
Caste in stone
A religious figure is supposed to renounce worldly considerations like caste, sub-caste, etc. But supporters of a CM of a northern state are reportedly working on a strategy to regroup former bureaucrats, academicians, intellectuals, media and others on a caste-based platform. The idea is not new: Chandrashekhar, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, Digvijaya Singh and Rajnath Singh's camp followers tried a similar tactic without success.
Trouble for Shashi Tharoor
MP Shashi Tharoor found himself in a bit of a spot after he announced with fanfare an online meeting of the parliamentary standing committee on information technology. Apparently, Tharoor, a former Union minister of state and a UN official, hurriedly made the announcement after a cursory conversation with Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla. The Lok Sabha secretariat communicated to the speaker that rules to switch over to online meetings have not been approved. The speaker’s office then informed Tharoor that having a meeting of parliamentary panels via video-conferencing will violate the confidentiality clause. A volte-face followed.

2,2,"Chennai: “I have had no income since the lockdown began and I have no money left. I have absolutely no idea as to how I will survive this,” said Neelavathi.
As coronavirus victim tales go, this narrative is not entirely a unique one. Neelavathi’s trade, like most other trades, has been dealt a mortal blow, rendering her penniless.
 
But unlike other daily wage earners, who have social support systems, Neelavathi has no one to tell her story to. She’s a commercial sex worker (CSW). Though the problems she mentions are similar to anybody else’s -- no transport, long queues at shops and police chasing her away in the street -- her lack of work is unique. Not only can she not work from home, there’s no place where her clients can reach her.
On a normal day, Neelavathi steps out for work around 10 am and is back home by around 5 pm. She is one of the CSWs engaged to a ‘house’ in Moolakadi, where she is paid Rs 300 for every client she services. At times she may go out with a client to a lodge or a guest house and make Rs 1000 or more. But that happens rarely.
Whatever it is, on an average she used to make Rs 500 per day, which was just enough to feed her two children and her. Since she commutes by bus and autorickshaw, the lockdown has left her immobile, confined to her house.
Besides, she has another worry: She has run out of condoms. As a member of the Red Hills Thai Vizhuthugal Nala Sangam, a community-based organisation (CBO) of CSWs, she’s acutely aware of the need for condoms and regularly visits Red Hills to collect her quota of prophylactics.
The president of Red Hills Thai, Poongodi, said the lockdown came out of the blue. After the coronavirus scare began, at an annual meeting of the collective recently, they had discussed the precautions to be taken against the virus. But the lockdown caught them unawares.
The CBO has about 1300 members, all of them CSWs. Many of the women often turn to Poongodi for help but this time the CBO is not equipped to give them any.
The president of the Namakkal District Thai Vizhuthugal Women’s Trust, Geetanjali, put out a message on her Facebook page on April 4 seeking help for the members of her trust, many of whom were going without food.
She said among her members were women who lived below the poverty line and those afflicted by HIV.
She told Deccan Chronicle that many of her members were having just a single meal a day and had no money for other basic needs. Some of the women were living alone with no family support and their plight was the worst, she said.
The Nammakkal-based CBO has about 1,500 members, living in villages around the town. Geethanjali fears that the coronavirus crisis might lead to a spread of HIV.
How so? She explained that CSWs pushed to the brink are at risk of giving in to sexual demands in lieu of minor financial or material favours in this time of distress and may thus indulge in risky behaviour due to the lackc of a prophylactic.
Agreeing with her, A J Hariharan of the Indian Community Welfare Organisation (ICWO) said CSWs were primarily responsible for containing the spread of HIV in the country in the past. Hariharan, who has been into AIDS/HIV prevention work since the early 1990s, said it was due to the insistence of these women on use of condoms that stopped the HIV infection.
Hariharan said there are 6,300 CSWs in Chennai alone and about 90,000 in the whole of Tamil Nadu. All of them have been hit by the lockdown. Even before the coronavirus, many of them lived in abject poverty. Now the loss of livelihood has affected them so badly they cry on the phone while asking for help.
“We have a stomach to feed,” says Latha, who has never faced a situation like this in her six-year career as a CSW.  She has two children to take care of. Normally she would earn about Rs 1000 a day, serving an average of three clients. She used to work from 11 am to 5.30 pm at a ‘house’ near Moolakadi.
Latha has not stepped out of street in Vyasarapadi since the lockdown began. But she has found an alternative career to make money from her house. She has started making tea and selling it on the street. She makes about Rs 100 a day. “Something is better than nothing,” she says.

3,3,"Ever since Doordarshan announced the re-telecast of some of their iconic TV shows, the actors and producers of the said shows have been at loggerheads.
The decision to air 11 popular shows from the 80s and 90s was taken amidst the nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19 .
 
The national broadcaster has recorded an all-time high audience as the channel ever since has registered a 650 per cent growth in its viewership.
According to BARC India, the first four shows of Ramanand Sagar’s 'Ramayana' garnered 170 million impressions and DD National became the most-watched channel across the country.
This was followed by the re-runs of classics such as 'Byomkesh Bakshi', 'Shaktimaan', 'Buniyaad', 'Circus', 'Dekh Bhai Dekh', 'Alif Laila', 'Chanakya', 'Upanishad Ganga' and 'The Jungle Book', which became equally popular in the first week and even attracted several sponsors.
Due for their diligence
This rekindled popularity has once again drawn the attention to many seasoned yet forgotten actors who had become household names when their shows aired for the first time.
So it’s hardly surprising that some of them are now demanding a royalty from the profits of this re-telecast. 'Byomkesh Bakshi' actor 'Sunil Sinha', in a Facebook post, wrote that the channel and producer should give royalty money to the actors.
“When the government has decided to re-telecast the show, the channel and producer will make money. So when the producer is getting extra money, why not the actors and technicians who have worked hard on the show?” the actor asks.
Similarly, Dipika Chikhlia, who played Sita in the epic 'Ramayana' opposite Arun Govil’s Ram, feels that the cast of the show should be respected for their contributions.
“Money doesn’t harm anybody and I would have liked to see the profits shared with the actors as well,” says the actress. She also adds that the actors of the iconic mythological show weren’t duly paid well even when the show was shot.
“Everyone knows when the Ramayana was made, we were paid peanuts. It would have been really nice if we were shown some kind of appreciation with the makers sharing the profits with us,” she says.
Trickle down theory
Veteran actress Pallavi Joshi, who played an integral part in the popular 80s show 'Buniyaad', says that India should have adapted the concept of extending royalty to actors, a practice common in the US.
“Actors are actually forced to do a lot of work that they don’t wish to because of not having royalties in place, so it should have been introduced long back,” says the actress.
Mita Vashisht, who shared the screen with Shah Rukh Khan and Ashutosh Gowarikar in the iconic show 'Circus', adds that the industry is not mature enough to acknowledge the efforts of all involved.
“It is the actors who have made these shows popular. In a healthy industry, some percentage of royalty should be given to everyone. But our industry is not thoughtful in terms of royalties,” says the 'Dil Se' actress, who feels that everyone needs to respect the actors and technicians’ contributions.
Producers differ
But the producers of these iconic shows, have a parallel view on the matter. For instance, 'Shaktimaan' actor Mukesh Khanna, who is also the producer of the show, clarifies that actors sign a contract agreeing that they will not claim any money or royalty upon the re-telecast of the show, which means that they have no legal claim.
“It is not done. Certain things are contractual and actors have to abide by it. The producer can recover the money by all means. As an actor, I would say it sounds good. But as a producer, I will be making money from everywhere,” says the actor who is also a part of the on-going epic show 'Mahabharata' on DD.
“Besides, most of them are seasoned actors and they are doing pretty well in the industry, so why to give them royalty?” he says, refuting the claims made by actors seeking a share of the pie.
Joshi however disagrees with Khanna and feels the claims made by the actors are valid. “The channel hasn’t produced any show, and the effort made by the producer during a re-run is zero. So when the producer is getting the extra money then he should distribute a percentage of it to the actors and technicians who are at home in these difficult times and struggling to put food on the table for their children,” she says.

4,4,"Hyderabad: The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has notified the state government to extend the lockdown in the state capital till the end of May.
Covid-19 cases have been increasing at alarming pace in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) limits. Another 30 cases were reported on Friday. Mayor Bonthu Rammohan puts the blame on the people and said if they do not cooperate with the government and observe the lockdown strictly, it would be extended until the coronavirus cases reach zero.
 
Rammohan said chief minister K. Chandrashekar Rao has taken a very serious view of people violating the lockdown protocol and may come up with stringent rules after the Cabinet meeting scheduled on April 19. He noted that though about 45,000 vehicles have been seized for violating lockdown rules, people were still moving about on the roads using fake passes.
""We have been keeping strict vigil only in the containment zones by trusting the others. The government is clueless about the number of coronavirus positive cases in the remaining areas. If the public movement is not curtailed and if they do not cooperate with the government, they are risking their lives and those of others,” he said.
He cited other cases, one of an onion seller in Rajendernagar who came in contact with a Nizamuddin Markaz returnee and interacted with 45 others and later tested positive and that of a migrant who travelled in a train with Markaz returnees and was asymptomatic but one of his contacts, his landlady, died.
“We are not sure whether a 14-day quarantine is enough to contain Covid-19. I advise people to quarantine for 28 days even though they have tested negative,"" Rammohan said.
He said May would be favourable to contain Covid-19 and the arrival of the monsoon in June could complicate the situation as other contagious diseases spread with the rains.
""It is not easy to manage a city with a huge population. The public should abide by the law to contain the deadly virus,"" he said.
He urged residents to click pictures of those who violate social distancing norms at supermarkets, meat shops and other markets and post them on social media platforms. The corporation would seal all the shops for the lockdown period, he said.

5,5,"Bengaluru: In this summer of the coronavirus, who doesn’t have a tale of woe? For farmers it’s all-too familiar a situation: just when the crop is coming to hand, a natural disaster strikes and they are unable to reach the market in time and the produce rots in the field.
For horticulturists, this has been such a time: there’s a severe shortage of summer fruits and vegetables in the cities, but they are unable to market their produce.
 
Amidst this gloom, grape farmers in and around Bengaluru have got together to pull off a miracle. Unobtrusively and unknown to many, hundreds of grape growers have coalesced into a direct marketing movement in and around the city.
By skirting market structures and lockdown barriers, they are reaching resident welfare associations direct and selling their produce straight to the consumer.
This movement was initiated by the University of Agriculture Sciences (UAS) Alumni Association to help grape farmers find a market in this corona-hit summer.
Look at the difference this is making: while the government-run procurement agency HOPCOMS picks up an average of 2-3 tons of grapes per day from farmers, the direct marketing initiative is moving 250-300 tons a day.
UAS Alumni Association president Dr K Narayangowda says he never dreamed of such a huge response from the people. 
How it began
Around the time when the coronavirus lockdown was declared, vineyards around Bengaluru were approaching harvest. The country was already in the grip of the coronavirus, and a total shutdown of markets spelt disaster for grape growers.
Bengaluru’s vines are not linked to the food processing industry; they sell most of their produce to the consumer. If they are shut out now, the crop would have to be destroyed.
Export to other states was out of the question, not with the transport system down and a lockdown everywhere else too. “We had to find a market right here,” said Narayanagowda.
So 12 days ago, the UAS Alumni Association knit up the farmers into a patchwork collective linked with WhatsApp, and made pitches to a few residents’ association.
“To understand the market, we went to the HOPCOMS main centre near Lalbagh. We found HOPCOMS procuring grapes for Rs 45 per kg from the farmer and selling it through its outlet just adjacent to the procurement centre for Rs 115 per kg. We were shocked by the margin it was making,'' Narayanagowda said.
Then they visited farmers in the Kolar and Chikkaballapur region and started working out the cost. Farmers were educated on how to pack them and what time they had to harvest once the order was confirmed and delivery schedules.
 “We realised that Rs 55 per kg was an ideal price for farmers and we started reaching out to residents' associations by publicising our WhatsApp number. We landed a first order for 1.5 tons,” says Narayanagowda.
It was a good deal for the consumers: where they had to go to the market and buy grapes at Rs 120 per kg, they were getting the same stuff at their doorstep for no more than Rs 55-60 per kg.
In the next three days, the number of orders just baffled them. “We have a lot of residents' association working with farmers. At Rajarajeshwari Nagar, the Rotary Club president has taken the lead and four sets of farmers are supplying them grapes. At the end of the week, we ended up selling over 250-300 tons per day in Bengaluru alone. Besides learning about the market, many farmers are also directly exploring some of the markets,'' he said.
“We learnt a lot of things about grape marketing. In the first place, Bengaluru people were never exposed to quality grapes by traders. Very few had access to quality grapes. Some had given up eating grapes. Now, everyday new grape fans are being added to the list. We are making a database and we’ll launch online marketing by next year,'' says Narayanagowda.
What about mango?
The cooperative is planning to try the grape tactics with mango, which is just beginning to come into the market. The mango market is in a similar situation as grape: it cannot be shipped out of the state.
However, the grape tactics did not work with other fruits and vegetables. Tomato is harvested at the same time as grapes but its market is different. Over 80 per cent of tomato grown around Bengaluru goes to the Kissan factory for making sauce. But the since the factory is closed, there was no way farmers could find an alternative market. Traders refused to pick up the excess tomato because prices would crash. So farmers had no choice but to let the produdce rot on the farm.
Though vegetable demand and supply remains the same, the situation is exploited by traders. Citing social distance, they have created distance between product and consumer, driving the prices up. But farmers get no dividend from this.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his address to the nation on April 14 appealed to people to download the app.
 
""Telephone took 75 years to reach 50 million users, radio 38 yrs, television 13 yrs, Internet 4 yrs, Facebook 19 months, Pokemon Go 19 days. AarogyaSetu, India's app to fight COVID-19 has reached 50 mn users in just 13 days-fastest ever globally for an App,"" Kant said in his tweet.
The Aarogya Setu app alerts people if any person in their vicinity has tested positive for COVID-19.
District administrations have been asking all educational institutions and government departments to push people to download the app. The more people install the app on their phones, the more effective it becomes at identifying through location data and Bluetooth data, which phones have come into close contact with an infected person.
The app accesses data of infected persons from the Ministry of Health and alerts people if they have come into contact with a Covid-19 infected person.
According to sources, Tata Consultancy Services is working on testing the app and some of its other aspects while Tech Mahindra and the Mahindra group is working on the next version of this application leveraging data science and next generation technologies such as machine learning.
Tech Mahindra is also working on expanding the reach of Aarogya Setu to all types of phones. The current version of Aarogya Setu app is fit for use on smartphones only.

While urging download of the Aarogya Setu app, it advised personnel to avoid it in office premises, operational areas and sensitive locations. Personnel, veterans and families have been asked to cyber security precautions.
 
Aarogya Setu is a mobile app developed by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology to help citizens identify their risk of contracting Covid-19.
“Existing cyber security policies on usage of mobile phones must be adhered to by army personnel while using the Aarogya Setu app,” the soldiers were informed, said sources.
The Indian Army has asked its personnel to only switch on the location services and bluetooth features of the Aarogya Setu app while visiting public places, or when they are engaged in managing isolation centres, while on call for COVID-19 related assistance to civil authorities and while out of cantonments or military stations for essential administrative duties.
They have been told not to disclose their service identity including rank and appointment. The contact list of the user should not contain any reference to rank appointment or service. Army personnel have been advised to keep their mobile operating systems updated and to install antivirus protection on their cell phones.
The Aarogya Setu app has crossed the 5 crore downloads in just the 13 days since it was launched.
The app uses bluetooth, GPS, algorithms and artificial intelligence to notify users of their risk of catching the COVID-19 infection, by tracing the same data from other users of the app. 
The app detects other devices with Aarogya Setu installed that come in the proximity of that phone. GPS tracks the location of the user in real time and bluetooth tracks if and when the user comes in close proximity with someone infected by COVID-19. 
If a user comes into contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19, they will be notified about it in a few days. The app has access to the Government of India’s database of known cases.

9,9,"Chennai: WhatsApp on Tuesday put spokes in the ever-turning wheel of misinformation by restricting forwards to just one chat at a time. The update has come to India first, in an indication of how widely the platform is being used to spread unverified information in the country. It will soon be rolled out globally.
Similarly in August 2018, WhatsApp limited forwarding to five chats after the platform found it was being used extensively in India to spread misinformation, fake news and propaganda.
 
The app, which has 2 billion users worldwide introduced the curbs globally around January 2019. NDTV reported that WhatsApp claimed the restrictions led to a 25 per cent decrease in forwards globally.
The report also cited consulting firm Kantar as having found a 40 per cent increase in WhatsApp usage as COVID-19 began spreading globally. The messaging app owned by Facebook was reported to have made the “greatest gains” in usage among social media apps.
Now, with fake news threatening to derail efforts to combat the deadly coronavirus pandemic, WhatsApp, which has 400 million users in India, has introduced the stricter curbs in the country.
However, one can still use the forward option several times to send a message to multiple users or copy a message and paste it to various chats.
To ensure that users got only authoritative information on COVID-19, WhatsApp had recently collaborated with the Government of India to create a chat bot to answer queries.
Earlier, in August, WhatsApp added a ‘Forwarded’ label to messages that were not composed by a close contact of the user.
Last month, the app also took measures to mark certain forward messages as requiring verification, on its beta version. A magnifying lens icon appearing alongside the message prompted users to search online and verify the content. But since the update has not been rolled out for all users, several messages and videos were still being shared without being flagged in any manner.

10,11,"I was speaking yesterday to a friend from Bangalore who has lived in the United States for most of his life. He is employed by a software firm and his work requires him to travel to India three times a year. I have known him for about a quarter century and he has been coming with regularity. It has been his routine and he spends at least 60 days each year in India on work.
However, he will not be coming to Bangalore next month, as he was supposed to do, and he does not know when he would next be sent. Companies and businesses will not put their employees at risk any time soon, especially those firms based in America and Europe. They have laws which individuals can use if they feel they have been endangered and their safety jeopardised by their employer. Till there is a vaccine for Covid-19, this situation will remain uncertain.
 
Of course, this will have an impact on the airlines. Already there is a ban on international travel pretty much across the world. Europeans cannot go to America and vice versa. No passenger flights are operating in India. Even when the lockdown is opened in mid April, the number of people flying on work internally will be low and after an initial couple of days when those who are stuck go immediately to where they need to be, the traffic will be lower each month than it was last year.
How will airlines, which operate on very thin margins and sometimes operate at a loss as we have seen in India, manage? They will not be able to and the state will need to decide whether to bail them out (meaning tax payer money to be used on airplane leases and pilot and crew salaries) or let them die. From a position where India was about to sell its national carrier, Air India, we are faced with the possibility that the government buys stakes in a few more and possibly all airlines.
Tourism employs something like 10 per cent of the world’s population. My friend stays in a hotel in Bangalore and that place will also lose income from business travellers for the foreseeable future. Restaurants will be hit for the new few months as people will continue remaining home unless absolutely required to be in public spaces. Similarly, malls and cinema halls and all those sorts of places which have high levels of mingling and crowds will suffer crushing losses of revenue. How will we cope and what will our new economy look like? We do not know at this point and we will need to learn as we go along.
The chief economist of HDFC bank has written this week that the cost of Covid 19 to the Indian economy will be $100 billion, or Rs 7.5 lakh crore. That is equal to what India spends on defence plus all central government schemes (MNREGA, education, health, PM Awas, Smart Cities, Swachch Bharat, Mid Day meals, drinking water, irrigation etc) combined. Meaning that either we do not spend on all these things, which is not possible, or we borrow or print the money required to do all this.
It is hard to imagine a sector which will not be violently affected by the health crisis, the lockdown and what will come after. The sales for cars and automobiles in March were 50 per cent lower in India than they were in March 2019. This is despite the fact that we lost only about eight days due to the lockdown that month. In April the hit will be bigger because half the month is part of the lockdown. Power consumption was 25 per cent lower this week than in April 2019. This is entirely because factories are shut down and will lose three weeks of output at least. After that, they will hope that their workers return from villages and that is not going to happen soon.
There are three or four estimates on what the cost to the Gross Domestic Product of India will be. The most positive one says that we will lose two per cent points of GDP growth. The most negative says we will lose four per cent. The truth is that nobody knows at the moment what will come in April and May, just as nobody anticipated in February that March would turn out the way that it did though the Coronavirus story was already in the headlines then.
It will occupy the world for the rest of 2020 and perhaps even beyond that and will have medium and long-term ramifications. The short term ones, the ones that we have described above, are immediate and visible. But there will be others, especially on the future of the global economy, that may impact us for an entire generation. Because we are currently in the middle of the immediate health crisis, there has not been much discussion of this so far but it will start soon.
It is a very difficult task ahead for the prime minister and for the nation, even after the lockdown ends.

11,12,"Chennai: As cities world over go through various phases of lockdown, people living in strange places away from friends and family would long for some familiarity. With Tinder’s Passport feature, a Chennaiite stuck in Lucknow, can now choose potential dates from their own hometown—even if it’s only for an online date, given the circumstances.
The Passport feature, formerly open only to Tinder Plus and Gold users, was made open to all on March 26. It allows you to drop a pin in a location of your choice and look for matches in that city.
 
""We hope our members, many of whom are anxious and looking for more human connection, can use Passport to transport themselves out of self-quarantine or isolation to anywhere in the world,"" Tinder CEO Elie Seidman said in a statement.
 “Now more than ever, having someone to talk to makes a world of a difference,” says the tagline for Passport on the Go Tinder blog. Since Passport became free, Tinder has registered the highest number of swipes on March 29. Indians used Passport 25 per cent more after it became a free feature.

The picturesque snow-clad mountain range was visible for the first time in Jalandhar on Friday, over a week since the lockdown was imposed on the midnight of March 24.
 
The Dhauladhar mountain range, part of the Himalayan range in Himachal Pradesh, became visible in Jalandhar after years as pollution dipped across Punjab.
As more and more residents laid eyes on the entire Himalayan range from their rooftops, social media was filled with some delightful images.
Ace Indian cricketer Harbhajan Singh took to his twitter to express his joy about the same.
Indeed it was a sight to behold for all the punjab residents and its something to cherish forever.

13,14,"With the cult classic film Hera Pheri completing 20 years after its release in March 2000, the buzz about a series revival is stronger than ever before. Starring Paresh Rawal as Baburao with Akshay Kumar and Suniel Shetty as Raju and Shyam, the film got two action heroes into comic roles, doing everything unheroic on screen and yet managing to entertain the audience.
“I cannot fathom the kind of response I still get about the film,” reminisces Suniel Shetty, who confirms that a remake is in the works. “The film is happening for sure. I won’t know when,” he had told us recently.
 
“The first part had both of us, action heroes, doing comedy for the first time. We were shooting for the film in Chennai and we wrapped the film in a single location in a lockdown kind of situation —that is how director Priyadarshan works,” the actor further reveals.
If one recalls, the second part never came close to being as funny as the original as most of the actors in the film tried to get loud and get the plaudits that only Baburao got in the film.
Producer Firoz Nadiadwala — who last made Welcome Back — was last speaking to both Priyadarshan as well as Ahmed Khan to see who could direct the third part. Priyadarshan had directed the first part while Neeraj Vora directed the second part. Neeraj was to direct the third part of the film, but he expired. Earlier in 2015, they had planned the film with a partial change in cast with Dostana duo John Abraham and Abhishek Bachchan stepping in along with Suniel playing Ghanshyam, and Paresh retaining his Baburao slot. However, that did not happen.

14,15,"Saloni’s twitter account has 98.3k followers and this charming college student’s impersonation of Kangana Ranaut who she wickedly calls Kangana ‘'Runnout’, has earned her 34.7k likes on Twitter. “I hope she likes it too. I have seen Queen multiple times and I believe Kangana is a great actress,” she quickly adds.
It is Kangana, who by default paved the way for Saloni’s foray into comic videos. “I used to mimic her in school and my friends loved it,” she concedes. This youngster straddles dual worlds. She studies economics and political science by day at her university and recedes into her hostel, to make comic videos. “Initially I only did voiceovers but one day a random video I made went viral and my friends suggested that I should show my face. So I bought this wig from Amazon as a part of my get up and everybody loved it. Everyone was making videos. When I joined insta I noticed that Mallika Dua was making videos. I did not know how to channel my thoughts into a video. My brother Shubham, who has appeared in Amazon Prime’s Hostel Days and he’s a Youtuber, guided me.”
 
And that is how the demure housewife with fierce views became an instant hit. And the biggest high for her was, “When Kusha Kapila messaged me after seeing my video. I was on cloud nine that day,” she says.
Nazma Aapi airs her views nonchalantly on everything from panic buying post corona virus to a desi mother-in-law’s views post lockdown. Like actress Sonam, who Saloni recently impersonated and even got an appreciated response back, the young sensation has the ability to laugh at herself. Recounting an older video on Delhi’s air pollution, she laughingly admits, “I look very poor in that video. I stay at a hostel in Delhi. I opened the door, it was so hazy, I just woke up, did not wash my face, used my phone camera and started shooting. I look so pathetic.”
You’ve got to hand it to Saloni. She exudes remarkable self confidence when she says, “People ask me why I don’t apply make up? So when I mimicked Sonam I put on the best kurta I had, to do justice to Sonam as she is a fashion icon. But Nazmi aapi does not require a makeover,” asserts the girl who also doubles up as the background guy who comments in her videos. I am the guy in the background, I can imitate Jimmy Shergil too, so decided to do the male voice over.”
Saloni who hails from UP modestly states she is not famous in her hometown but wickedly adds that her relatives are wary of her as she might just mimic them. “My nani refuses to speak in front of me as she is afraid that I will imitate her also,” she laughs.
Saloni happily admits that none of her videos have generated any hate mails or comments. “I am very balanced and take care not to offend anyone in my social commentary.”
The future looks bright as Saloni is currently doing collaborative videos and ads and will be venturing into radio soon. Speaking about the process of creating, Saloni says that working on filmi impersonations does not take time but when she dons the garb of Nazma Aapi, it takes her 2.5 hours to work on the script and shoot. “My parents are supportive. They told me to not target anybody and that is something that I am cautious about. My brother too was very supportive.”

15,16,"Billionaire technology entrepreneur Elon Musk had recently taken to the microblogging site to tweet, “Yes. Just as with groceries, the panic is also causing hoarding of ventilators, preventing them from reaching the hospitals where they are needed.”
Even though the Government of India, recently, prohibited the export of surgical masks and ventilators because of its shortage in hospitals, the uber-rich are panic-buying and hoarding ventilators at home at the cost of Rs 10 lakh. Ventilators are used for patients suffering from coronavirus to keep them alive if they struggle to breathe.
 
But is this a sensible move? Experts including Dr Sundeep Lakhtakia, who is a senior consultant at Asian Institute of Gastroenterology, feel otherwise. “This is sheer stupidity and waste of resources. It’s like buying a fighter jet for whenever we may have a war even when one does not know how to fire a missile, let alone fly a plane,” he says.
To begin with, those buying/hoarding a ventilator tend to forget that they will still need someone to manage the machine at home. Moreover, where will they find the necessary therapist or doctor to run the ventilator if it comes to that? For those wondering if it is, in the first place, possible to run a critical care patient privately at home especially in the Indian scenario, Dr Khizar Raoof, Consultant Urologist, Olive Hospital, shares his thoughts. “Unless they have an intensivist — a specialist doctor handling ICUs  — at home, it’s of no use. We just don’t have enough staff to run hospitals, let alone home ventilators,” he cautions. Adding to the above thought, Dr Sunil Kapoor, senior Interventional Cardiologist, Apollo Hospitals, says, “It needs to be connected to a high-pressure oxygen line, which is available only in the ICCU of hospitals.”
Procedure and infrastructure
In addition to the above, ventilator settings also must be monitored and changed as per the patient’s need, depending on the patient’s condition. What’s more, the patient must be appropriately sedated to tolerate the ventilator. So essentially, the issue here is about how to set it up.
“Adjustment of a ventilator is an hourly issue,” explains Dr Chaitanya Challa, Challa Nursing Home. “A doctor has to be constantly present to adjust it. Buying an oxygen concentrator at home is acceptable, but a ventilator at home is not feasible. Ventilators also need an oxygen supply and compressed air, which is again not possible at home.”
According to Dr K. Subba Reddy, Sr Consultant Critical Care, Apollo Health City, ventilating a patient requires the entire intensive care infrastructure. “Just buying ventilators and keeping them ready outside ICU settings is not advisable. Sometimes, they may require prolonged ventilator support,” he adds. “Further, they require good doctors and nurses to take care of them. They may also require other organ support such as dialysis and multiple other consultants’ involvement. Added to it all, they will require very close monitoring to wean off the ventilator. So, it is not possible to create efficient ICUs at home.”
Other valid concerns
In government-run hospitals, it is very difficult to get vacant ventilators. In private hospitals, ventilators are available but are highly priced. So also, experts think it unwise and warn against anyone getting into an unnecessary panic-buying of ventilators during this time.
“In the Indian scenario, if things go worse, the government will take over all the ventilators. Even the ones in private hospitals,” warns Dr Khizar Raoof. “They’re already getting private medical colleges ready, and if the need arises, private hospitals will also become a part of the war against corona.”
Dr Sunil Kapoor also reminds people that very few of the corona patients need ventilators in the first place.
“COVID-19 infection results in respiratory distress syndrome in only 2-4 per cent of people. For instance, as of now, there are 40 patients admitted in the COVID-19 ward of the Gandhi Hospital and not a single patient is on ventilator,” elaborates Dr Sunil Kapoor.

16,17,"Hyderabad: It’s not just street dogs in the cities that have become the unwitting victims of the coronavirus lockdown. Monkeys that are used to being fed by pilgrims travelling through the Amrabad Tiger Reserve in Telangana are finding their food supply chain disrupted too.
On an average, 500-600 vehicles pass through the Amrabad Tiger Reserve along the pilgrim trail to Srisailam. On weekends, the number ranges from 2,000 to 3000.
 
Used to being fed scraps thrown out of vehicle windows, troops of monkeys, mostly rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), sit on either side of the road, especially at speed breakers.
Amrabad forest range officer J Sudhakar says the monkeys seem to have grown skinny in just the week or so since the nation was put under a coronavirus lockdown.
Indeed, there are fruit trees in the forest that can be an alternative food source but the monkeys have grown used to food thrown by passing pilgrims.
“Maybe in a week or so they will realise that the days of free meals are over and move into the forest,” said the officer.
It is quite possible that some hungry troops may march to Mannanur village on the highway, which marks the beginning of the forest road in Telangana, or to Vatvarlapally village in the middle of the tiger reserve.
However, after the total lockdown began, people in these villages too are staying indoors and the monkeys may have no option but to forage in the forest.
This has already happened in the Kawal Tiger Reserve, through which several roads pass. Monkey troupes there are reported to have returned to the forest and have been sighted around percolation tanks and feeding on the fruits of trees in the forest.

18,20,"A woman squeezes through a barricade set up at a containment zone in Hyderabad on Friday, May 1, 2020. Doctors in the Telangana capital say the state government is allowing Covid-19 patients to slip through and mingle in open society. It's a great danger to the strategy to contain the Covid-19 pandemic, it said. (DC Photo)

Hyderabad: When the Inter-Ministerial Central Team (IMCT) of officials visited Telangana earlier this week, the doctors and public health specialists they met had a startling point to make: The state government is under-testing and under-reporting Covid-19 cases. And it is not reporting Covid-19 deaths.

Simply put, the figures you see in the official bulletins are not the real picture at all.

Under the banner of Doctors for Seva, these doctors and publish health specialists told the IMCT that they are deeply concerned that Covid-19 patients are in effect mingling in the community.

If they are not identified and isolated soon, there could be an exponential increase in the number of cases and this would have wider implications for controlling the pandemic at the state, national, and international levels, they stated.

Doctors for Seva asked the IMCT to look into the gaps and rectify them. The doctors insisted they want to be part of the team fighting Covid-19 but they want the state government to be clear and transparent.

The government statistics raise a lot of concerns, especially when compared to other states. To add to this, there was an order by the Telangana health department on April 20 that samples must not be taken from the bodies of Covid-19 suspected deaths.

Doctors for Seva said in a joint statement: “This is a risky strategy. It is a pandemic. It demands that government follow international guidelines which have been chalked out and (which) brought the situation in control in Europe, China and the USA. We have to follow protocols to safeguard our people. The decision of TS to not test is very disturbing and will backfire very badly.”

Doctors for Seva cited the example of Suryapet where the second-highest number of cases in the state — 83 — was reported. But then, no testing has been carried out there since April 23. It has been more than a week now and doctors are worried that the numbers may have exploded. Without testing, there is no knowing how widespread Covid-19 is.

At the ground level, people suffering from bilateral pneumonia, chest scans showing abnormal conditions and patients in intensive care units of private hospitals are not being tested for Covid-19. The doctors say this is against the guidelines of the Indian Council of Medical Research.

“Our concern is (that the) actual load is much higher and once lockdown is relaxed the number of missed patients could surge in the state,” the Doctors for Seva statement said.

The joint statement was signed by Dr Santhosh Kraleti, public health specialist, Dr Vijayanand J., consultant paediatrician, Dr G. Veda Prakash, orthopaedic surgeon, Dr M. Srikanth, consultant paediatrician, Dr M. Rajender Reddy, consultant urologist, and Dr Karuna, consultant paediatrician.",https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/020520/doctors-telangana-official-covid-19-figures-are-just-not-true.html,Covid,/Seva:Hyderabad

New Delhi: The Ministry of Home Affairs on Saturday clarified that barber shops and salons will be allowed to open in green and orange zones during the third phase of the lockdown beginning May 4, besides sale of non-essential items by e-commerce platforms.

The MHA on Friday, while extending the lockdown for two more weeks till May 17, lifted many restrictions in green and orange zones.

There are no restrictions on sale of non-essential items by e-commerce platforms in green and orange zones, a home ministry spokesperson said, adding barber shops and salons are also allowed to open in these areas.

In red zones, the e-commerce companies are allowed to sell only essential commodities.

Barber shops and salons are not allowed to open in red zones as these are services not goods.

Sale of liquor is allowed in green, orange and red zones, which is not under containment.

Liquor sale is allowed in green, orange and red zones if it is a standalone shop and not located in markets or malls in red zone.

In liquor shops, customers will have to maintain minimum six feet distance (2 gaz ki doori) from each other, and also ensure that not more than five persons are present at one time at the shop.

The exemptions will be effective from May 4 when the third phase of the lockdown will begin.

On allowing domestic maids to work in red zones, a home ministry official said the RWAs should take a call regarding allowing the movement of outsiders.

But health protocols have to be maintained by domestic helps as well as employers, and the responsibility lies with the person who employs maids in case of any mishappening.

Classifications of districts into 'Red', 'Orange' and 'Green' zones is done based on the basis of COVID-19 risk profiling.

A district will be considered as a 'Green' zone if there are no confirmed cases so far or there is no reported case for the past 21 days.

According to the health ministry, as on Friday, there were 130 'Red' zones in the country with maximum of 19 in Uttar Pradesh, followed by 14 in Maharashtra in the country. The number of 'Orange' Zone was 284 and 'Green' was 319.

All the districts of the national capital have been put under 'Red' zone.

Geneva/London: Countries must lift lockdowns gradually, while still being “on the look-out” for COVID-19 and ready to restore restrictions if the virus jumps back, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday.

Vulnerable people in institutions, including those in long-term care facilities, prisons and migrant dormitories, must be protected, its top emergencies expert Dr Mike Ryan said.

Even if the virus is coming under control, communities must know to still follow physical distancing and hygiene measures, and testing of suspect cases must continue, he said.

“It’s really important that as countries ease those measures that they are constantly on the look out for a jump in infections and in particular are dealing with the transmission in special settings,” Ryan told in a news conference.

The virus has spread in facilities for the elderly in Europe and North America, while in Singapore it has infected migrant workers in dormitories, he said, adding: “Because a spark in a situation like that turns into a fire very very quickly.”

The WHO recognises the difficulty for governments to maintain lockdowns during the pandemic, “for social, psychological and economic reasons”, Ryan said.

“So we are very anxious that we can move to a situation where the disease can be kept under control with less severe measures,” he said.

“But at the same time we want to avoid a situation where we release measures too easily and then we bounce back into the intense transmission and we have to do it all over again,” he said.

Even as some Western countries begin easing lockdowns, there are worrying trends of spread in countries from Haiti to Somalia and Yemen, Ryan said. He also cited Sudan, South Sudan, Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, Sierre Leone, Central African Republic, and a “serious cluster” in Kano, northern Nigeria.

Regarding the new coronavirus that first emerged late last year in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, he reiterated that scientists examining its genetic sequences have assured the WHO that “this virus is natural in origin”.

WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus gave a robust defence of his and the WHO’s “timely” actions in declaring the new coronavirus an international emergency at the end of January.

The January 30 declaration was made in “enough time for the rest of the world to respond” because at that stage outside China there were only 82 cases of infection and no deaths, he said.

Tedros said the WHO, which is seeking to lead the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic, had used the days before declaring the global emergency as time to visit China to learn more about the new virus.

During that visit, they also won a “ground-breaking agreement” with China to send in investigators, Tedros said.

Tedros, asked about relations with the United States - its biggest donor which has suspended funding after criticising WHO’s handling of the pandemic - said: “We are actually in constant contact and we work together.” He gave no further details.",https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/europe/020520/countries-must-prepare-for-virus-resurgence-after-easing-lockdown-who.html,Covid,

New Delhi: The central government on Friday announced that the nationwide lockdown, which was to end on May 3, is being extended for two weeks, till May 17. This would take the total number of days of shutdown to 54.

The third extension to the all-India lockdown, which has been in place since March 24, begins on May 4.

For the two-week extension, the country has been split into three zones — Red (hotspots), Orange and Green Zones — with separate relaxations and restri-ctions for each depending on the number of coronavirus cases they have.

Green Zones are districts with either zero confirmed cases till date or, no confirmed case in the last 21 days. Red Zones are based on the total number of active cases, the doubling rate of confirmed cases and the extent of testing and surveillance required.

Districts which are neither Red nor Green have been classified as Orange Zones. The classification of districts will be revised and shared by the Union Health Ministry with states and union territories (UTs) weekly. While states and UTs can include additional districts as Red or Orange Zones, they cannot lower the classification.

As part of the revised guidelines, some activities will remain completely prohibited, such as travel by air, rail, metro and inter-state movement by road except those specifically permitted; running of schools, colleges, and other educational and training/coaching institutions; hospitality services, including hotels and restaurants; places of large public gatherings, such as cinema halls, malls, gymnasiums, sports complexes etc; social, political, cultural and other kinds of gatherings; and, religious places/places of worship.

In the Red Zones, containment zones will be demarcated where certain activities are prohibited, like plying of cycle and autorickshaws, running of taxis and cab aggregators, intra-district and inter-district plying of buses, barber shops, spas and saloons. In the Red Zones, movement of individuals and vehicles is allowed only for permitted activities, with a maximum of two persons (besides the driver) in four-wheelers, and no pillion rider in the case of two-wheelers.

All standalone shops, neighbourhood shops and shops in residential complexes are permitted to open in urban areas, without any distinction of essential and non-essential goods or services.

All goods traffic is permitted and no state/UT shall stop the movement of cargo for cross land-border trade, which is essential for maintaining the supply chain of goods and services across the country during the lockdown period.

In all zones, persons above 65 years of age, those with co-morbidities, pregnant women, and children below the age of 10 shall stay at home, except for meeting essential requirements and for health purposes.

Out-patient departments (OPDs) in hospitals and medical clinics are permitted to operate in all all zones with social distancing norms and other safety precautions, however, these will not be permitted within containment zones.",https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/020520/lockdown-extended-to-may-17-but-you-can-start-breathing-now.html,Covid,

Seoul: North Korea's Kim Jong Un has made his first public appearance in nearly three weeks, state media reported Saturday, following intense speculation that the leader of the nuclear-armed nation was seriously ill or possibly dead.

The North reported that Kim had attended the opening of a fertiliser factory and released pictures it said showed the leader cutting a ribbon at the ceremony on Friday in Sunchon, north of Pyongyang, although the appearance could not be verified.

Rumours about Kim's health have been swirling since his conspicuous no-show at April 15 celebrations for the birthday of his grandfather, the North's founder -- the most important day in the country's political calendar.

His absence triggered a series of fevered rumours and unconfirmed reports over his condition, while the United States and South Korea insisted they had no information to believe any of the conjecture was true.

His sudden death would have left Pyongyang facing an unplanned succession for the first time in its history and raised unanswered questions over who would succeed him and take over the North's nuclear arsenal.

The Korean Central news agency said that onlookers ""broke into thunderous cheers of 'hurrah!'"" when Kim appeared.

The pictures released by the Rodong Sinmun newspaper showed Kim in his trademark black suit, smiling broadly as he looked around the factory.

He was flanked by senior officials -- including his sister and close adviser Kim Yo Jong -- and showed no outward signs of ill health.

As with previous pictures released by the North during the global coronavirus pandemic, Kim was not wearing a mask, unlike the hundreds of workers cheering for him and releasing balloons.

Analysts said Kim could not appear in public wearing a mask as it would make him appear vulnerable to the North Korean people.

The North has insisted that it has not seen a single case of coronavirus, although experts say it is unlikely.

Kim's repeated appearances without a mask had led some to speculate that he may have caught the virus.

Reporting from inside the isolated North is notoriously difficult, especially on matters relating to its leadership, which is among its most closely guarded secrets.

Rumours of ill health

The North Korean leader had not made a public appearance since presiding over a Workers' Party politburo meeting on April 11, and the following day state media reported that he had inspected fighter jets.

Daily NK, an online media outlet run mostly by North Korean defectors, had reported that Kim was undergoing treatment after a cardiovascular procedure last month.

Citing an unidentified source inside the country, it said Kim -- who is in his mid-30s -- had needed urgent treatment due to heavy smoking, obesity and fatigue.

Soon afterwards, CNN reported that Washington was ""monitoring intelligence"" that Kim was in ""grave danger"" after undergoing surgery, quoting an anonymous US official.

Officials in Seoul had consistently downplayed the reports and a presidential security advisor said that Kim was ""alive and well"" and staying in the eastern resort town of Wonsan.

Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha University in Seoul said Kim's disappearance had highlighted that the world was ""largely unprepared for instability in North Korea"".

""Washington, Seoul and Tokyo need tighter coordination on contingency plans,"" he said.

Rachel Lee, a former US government North Korea analyst, told AFP that the past weeks had also shown the ""insatiable appetite for news about the North Korean leadership"".

She highlighted the ""potential regional and international risks that come with Kim Jong Un's health"" while lamenting the ""poor analysis of North Korea that is based on impressions and speculation, not hard data"".

US president Donald Trump suggested earlier this week that Washington believed Kim to be alive and well and declined to immediately comment on Kim's apparent re-emergence.

Trump and Kim have met three times, although talks on the North's nuclear capabilities have long been stalled with no sign of them resuming.

Previous absences from the public eye on Kim's part have also prompted speculation about his health. The North is extremely secretive, especially about its leadership.

Kim's father and predecessor had been dead for two days before anyone outside the innermost circles of North Korean leadership was any the wiser.

In 2014, Kim Jong Un dropped out of sight for nearly six weeks before reappearing with a cane. Days later, the South's spy agency said he had undergone surgery to remove a cyst from his ankle.",https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/asia/020520/kim-jong-un-reappears-in-public-after-weeks-of-health-rumours.html,Covid,

In an act of utter inhumanity, a 75-year-old woman died by the roadside when villagers of East Narasapuram village in Singanmala mandal, and in particular her own relatives, were too scared to touch her, suspecting her to be a Covid-19 patient.

The villagers suspected she had Covid-19 because she came from Kurnool which is a seriously affected area. Durgamma had two daughters and had been living with one of them at Kothakota on the outskirts of Kurnool city for the past four months.

The daughter brought her mother to the village in an autorickshaw on April 28 to collect her old age pension and returned in the same autorickshaw, leaving her mother behind in the village.

The village ward staff found out that the old woman came from Kurnool district and alerted the medical officer of Singanmala mandal.

“Though she had a history of paralysis and hypertension she had no symptoms of covid virus, but her relatives stepped away from her and even failed to provide her food,” a member of the ward team said. It was the ward team that gave her food and medicines, he said.

Left with no support, she had another paralytic attack and died on the road on Friday. Local leader Srirami Reddy intervened and convinced the relatives and other villagers that Durgamma had died because of hyper tension and paralysis and had no symptoms of corona virus.

The villagers then cremated Durgamma and her relatives took part in the cremation.

26,28,"Hyderabad: In another setback to Tollywood actor Prabhas, the Telangana High Court has found fault with interim orders passed by a lower court which allowed him temporary possession of a property which the government says it owns.

The 2,083-square yard land parcel is located in Survey No. 5/3 at Raidurg Pan Maktha of Serlingampally in Ranga Reddy district. Prabhas said he bought the land years ago. He has a registered sale deed. He said the government had even accepted his application under a regularisation scheme in 2014.

Despite that, the land was seized and Prabhas approached the High Court in 2018 challenging the action.

The court ordered the government not to dismantle the building but rejected his plea to give him possession of the land. The title dispute was shifted to a trial court.

The trial court at Kukatpally granted interim injunction in favour of Prabhas till April 3. Due to the lockdown, all interim orders were extended till the first week of June.

Aggrieved with this, the revenue authorities filed a petition to vacate the order. When the plea was not heard, the government approached the High Court.

While dealing this plea, the division bench comprising chief justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and justice P. Naveen Rao observed that the order of the trial court was a mistake and possession of the property should not be with the actor.

The bench, however, directed the authorities not to demolish the property. It directed the trial court to immediately deal with the vacate application of the government and dispose of the case immediately on merits.",https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/in-other-news/020520/setback-for-actor-prabhas-in-land-dispute-with-telangana-government.html,Covid,/Ranga Reddy district:Hyderabad
27,29,"Hyderabad: The Centre may have extended the lockdown to May 17, but Telangana will have its own thoughts about it. The present phase of the lockdown in Telangana will run to May 7. So Telangana will take its own decision whether or not to extend it. The cabinet will meet on May 5 to take that decision.

Sources close to the government disclosed that after the Centre extended the lockdown on Friday, chief minister K. Chandrashekar Rao consulted senior officers and cabinet colleagues and decided to take the final call on May 5.

The state’s considerations are not just pandemic related but also economic. Daily revenue by way of tax collections has plunged to a fraction of the normal. So liquor sales in particular look appealing to the K Chandrashekhar Rao government.

The Centre announced relaxations in liquor sales when it decided to extend the lockdown to May 17, but sources said the Chandra Shekar Rao government may not jump at it to open up the booze vends.

The chief minister is of the opinion that the government should move cautiously in that direction as the lives of citizens are paramount.

The Union Home Ministry in its directive stipulated that sale of liquor, paan, gutkha and tobacco, will be allowed with shops selling them while ensuring the do gaz ki doori policy. Also, no more than five persons are to be present in the shop at any given time. That is a rare sight at liquor vends in Telangana.

Sources in the government revealed that a majority of senior officials and the top brass of the state police are not in favour of opening up.

Bengaluru: There are signs of trouble brewing in Karnataka with medical residents in the state demanding a raise in pay just as the coronavirus numbers are beginning to accelerate again.

Both positive cases and deaths have been by and large reined in in Karnataka in the past fortnight, but since Friday, they started to move again.

The Covid-19 death toll spurted by three in the past 24 hours, now reaching 25. The total number of corona positive cases too has begun accelerating towards the 600 mark with nine fresh cases being reported since Friday evening. The tally now stands at 598.

In the meantime the Karnataka Association of Resident Doctors has shot of a statement demanding that their pay be raised match the guidelines set by the Medical Council of India.

""Postgraduate and superspeciality residents, house surgeons are the backbone of medical colleges run by the government in Karnataka. These doctors have been working tirelessly day and night to give utmost possible medical care on the frontline of the COVID 19 pandemic,” the statement reminded chief minister B S Yediyurappa.

Threatening escalation of their demand if it was not met, the statement said ""The residents in Karnataka are the lowest paid in the country. Multiple representations have been made to the chief minister, minister for medical education, directorate of medical education since the past two years but in vain. It is injustice to underpay the hard working residents.

Karnataka’s numbers have been significantly lower than in neighbouring Telangana and Maharashtra. But the spurt of three deaths, and nine new cases just as relaxations of lockdown rules are poised to kick in from May 4 puts a question mark on the state’s corona strategy from hereon.

The three deaths reported since Friday included included a 69-year-male resident of Davanagere who was admitted in hospital on April 28 with a history of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) and a past history of diabetes heart disease. He died on Friday.

Another death was of an 82-year-old male resident of Bidar, who was admitted to hospital on April 27 evening SARI. He died the next day and tests on his serum found him to have been positive for Covid-19.

The third death was of a 63-year-male resident of Bangalore Urban district with diabetes, hypertension, hypothyroidism and renal failure. He had been on dialysis.

29,31,"Washington: US regulators on Friday allowed emergency use of the first drug that appears to help some COVID-19 patients recover faster, a milestone in the global search for effective therapies against the coronavirus.

The Food and Drug Administration cleared Gilead Science’s intravenous drug for hospitalized patients with “severe disease,” such as those experiencing breathing problems requiring supplemental oxygen or ventilators.

President Donald Trump announced the news at the White House alongside Gilead CEO Daniel O’Day and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn.

“This was lightning speed in terms of getting something approved” said Hahn, calling the drug “an important clinical advance.”

The FDA acted after preliminary results from a government-sponsored study showed that the drug, remdesivir, shortened the time to recovery by 31%, or about four days on average, for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

Those given the drug were able to leave the hospital in 11 days on average vs. 15 days for the comparison group. The drug may also help avert deaths, but that effect is not yet large enough for scientists to know for sure.

Dr Sameer Khanijo, a critical care specialist, said he wants to see additional studies to clarify the drug’s benefit.

“I don’t think this is a cure yet, but I think it’s starting to point us in the right direction,” said Khanijo of North Shore University Hospital in New York. “As a society, it’s nice to have something that will help stem the tide of this disease.”

The FDA said preliminary results from the government study warranted Friday’s decision, though regulators acknowledged “there is limited information known about the safety and effectiveness of using remdesivir.”

The drug’s side effects include potential inflammation of the liver and problems related to its infusion, which could lead to nausea, vomiting, sweating and low blood pressure. Information about dosing and potential safety issues will be provided to physicians and patients, the FDA said.

The National Institutes of Health’s Dr Anthony Fauci said Wednesday the drug would become a new standard of care for severely ill COVID-19 patients. Remdesivir, which blocks an enzyme the virus uses to copy its genetic material, has not been tested on people with milder illness.

The FDA authorized the drug under its emergency powers to quickly speed the availability of experimental drugs, tests and other medical products during public health crises.

In normal times the FDA requires “substantial evidence” of a drug’s safety and effectiveness, usually through one or more large, rigorously controlled patient studies. But during public health emergencies, the agency can waive those standards and require only that an experimental treatment’s potential benefits outweigh its risks.

Gilead has said it will donate its currently available stock of the drug and is ramping up production to make more. It said the US government would coordinate distribution of remdesivir to parts of the country that need it most.

No drugs are currently FDA-approved for treating the coronavirus, and remdesivir will still need formal approval.

The FDA can convert the drug’s status to full approval if Gilead or other researchers provide additional data of remdesivir’s safety and effectiveness.

“This is a very, very early stage so you wouldn’t expect to have any sort of full approval at this point,” said Cathy Burgess, an attorney specializing in FDA issues. “But obviously they want to get this out to patients as quickly as possible.”

The FDA previously allowed narrow use of a malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, for hospitalized patients who were unable to take part in ongoing studies of the medication. Trump repeatedly promoted it as a possible COVID-19 treatment, but no large high-quality studies have shown the drug works for that and it has significant safety concerns.

The FDA warned doctors late last month against prescribing the drug outside of hospital or research settings, due to risks of sometimes fatal heart side effects. The agency made the announcements after receiving new reports of injury and death with the medication, which is also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.

Two small studies published Friday add to concerns about hydroxychloroquine. Critically ill COVID-19 patients given the pill-based drug were prone to heart rhythm problems, and for many risks mounted when it was combined with an antibiotic, the studies found.",https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/america/020520/us-allows-use-of-remdesivir-to-help-virus-recovery.html,Covid,

Hyderabad: Air quality in the capital of Telangana is improving by leaps and bounds.

Since about forever, and until the lockdowns started circa March 25, the air quality index (AQI) of Hyderabad monitored by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) was 'hazardous'. Two weeks ago, it improved to just satisfactory. On Wednesday, it got better to ‘good.’ You can actually breathe now.

Hyderabad is not the only city to improve its air quality. It is one of the 17 cities, out of the 102 monitored nationwide, where air quality has improved enough to be in the 'good' category. For a change, the major pollutants in the city’s air are ozone (O 3 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) and particulate matter 10 (PM10).

“This is the result of the absence of motor vehicles on the roads. Vehicles release pollutants laced with unburnt hydrocarbons. Plus, industries located in the industrial development areas (IDAs) are not working,” said an official of the Telangana State Pollution Control Board (TSPCB).

So where's the NO 2 coming from then? It is being attributed to the garbage being burnt on the roads. Studies have shown that this pollutant is a major contributor to fataliteis due to respiratory ailments caused by Covid-19 (coronavirus).

A new paper published in the journal Science of the Total Environment has found that long-term exposure to air pollution may be one of the most important contributors to Covid-19 fatalities.

The study found that 78 per cent of the deaths occurred in just five regions in northern Italy and Spain that have the highest concentrations of NO 2 .

The presence of ozone is a cause of concern as it is a known factor in cancer.

31,33,"Rio De Janeiro: Rarely have two words ignited such a firestorm of controversy.

""So what?"" said Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro on Tuesday when a journalist asked him about the fact that more than 5,000 Brazilians had died of the coronavirus.

The far-right leader's off-the-cuff comment has been sparking anger ever since, with governors, politicians, healthcare professionals and media figures all weighing in to express their outrage at his lack of empathy.

Bolsonaro is no stranger to controversy. But his latest remark sparked such a fury because Brazil is facing a seemingly uncontrollable outbreak of the disease and is still several weeks away from the peak of the pandemic, with a death toll that threatens to surpass even the most dire predictions.

There have been more than 91,000 officially confirmed cases so far but scientists warn the real figure could be 15 to 20 times higher.

With a death toll that has already topped 6,300, the giant South American country is facing as grim a scenario as Italy or the United States.

""So what? I'm sorry. What do you want me to do?"" Bolsonaro said Tuesday when questioned about his country passing the 5,000-death mark, more than China. He joked that even though his middle name is Messias, or Messiah, ""I don't do miracles.""

Wilson Witzel, the governor of Rio de Janeiro state, called the president's remarks ""absolutely unacceptable.""

With his own state on the verge of a public health meltdown, Witzel slammed the president for ""being ironic about the deaths"" rather than ""being a leader at such a moment.""

""Do your job,"" he said on Twitter Wednesday, the day when the pro-gun president was training at a target range, far from the woes of Brazil's 210 million citizens.

'Brasilia bubble'

Joao Doria, governor of Sao Paulo state which is also on the frontlines of the battle against the coronavirus with more than 2,500 deaths already, replied furiously to Bolsonaro in the capital Brasilia.

""Get out of your Brasilia bubble,"" he retorted, urging Bolsonaro to visit hospitals ""in this country which is crying for its dead and infected.""

Unlike many other heads of state, the Brazilian leader has not been seen in any hospitals nor has he expressed much solidarity with victims of the disease, bereaved families or healthcare staff who have condemned the lack of ventilators or beds.

The head of the doctors' union in Sao Paulo, Eder Gatti, called on television for ""a more serious attitude from the president of the republic.""

Bolsonaro ""shows very little sensitivity to the tragedies that the families of those directly affected by the pandemic are going through,"" said Lucio Renno, director of the Institute of Political Science at Brasilia University.

""His style is the iron fist, to be hard rather than to show solidarity or empathy,"" he told AFP.

It is a style that inevitably draws comparison with Bolsonaro's own role model, US President Donald Trump.

That type of reaction is ""shocking for a large part of the population"" and ""reinforces the idea for a good part of the elites and for the Brazilian people that he is not fit to govern,"" Renno said.

Miriam Leitao, an op-ed writer at the daily O Globo, wrote on Thursday that with his ""So what?"" Bolsonaro had ""renounced the presidency.""

""Anyone who shows such contempt for his own people can no longer be president,"" she wrote.

'Judged by history'

In a tactic he has honed since becoming president, Bolsonaro quickly went on the offensive in the face of criticism from the governors and mayors, whom the Supreme Court has granted the power to call the shots in the fight against the pandemic.

""Ask Joao Doria or (Bruno) Covas [the mayor of Sao Paulo] why people continue to die even when they have taken such restrictive measures,"" said the president.

""They are the ones who should have the answers, you can't pin that on me.""

Nevertheless the press on Friday blamed the spike in infections and death on Bolsonaro, who has encouraged people to go out to work to prevent an economic crash and whose most fervent supporters have taken to the streets to protest against lockdown orders.

Bolsonaro's ""So what?"" has ""underscored how little importance he has attached to the situation,"" said political analyst Andre Pereira Cesar.

""If the president does not assume a wartime leadership stance against the virus he will be judged harshly -- by history and by voters,"" he warned.",https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/europe/020520/so-what-says-bolsonaro-on-5000-corona-deaths-in-brazil.html,Riot,

Things began to go awry earlier this week, and on Friday, the district recorded its first Covid-19 death, adding to Karnataka’s total of 23.

This was a 69-year old man who had a cardiac arrest after he was admitted in the district hospital complaining of a serious breathing problem. His son, three daughters-in-law, and a one-year-old grandson all tested positive for coronavirus on Friday.

The medical superintendent of the District Hospital, Dr Nagaraj said the deceased person had been undergoing treatment for high blood pressure and diabetes before he tested positive for coronavirus. He had been put on a ventilator on Wednesday.

Davanagere now has eight coronanvirus positives after three patients were discharged after recovery.

Things had been going well for more than 30 day with no new cases. Three corona cases, including the daughter of former Union minister G M Siddeshwar had recovered. People relieved a sigh of relief and the government began to ease some restrictions. But they are all back again.

34,36,"Mumbai: The Maharashtra government on Friday announced that lockdown in the (Covid-19) red zones like Mumbai, Pune region, Nagpur and Aurangabad, where the number of positive cases is on the rise will not be lifted even after May 3.

In addition to this, even the migrant workers, who are stuck in the containment zones of these cities will not be allowed to move to their respective states. According to the list of Union health Ministry, there are 14 districts in red zones in Maharashtra.



Maharashtra transport minister Anil Parab said that the government has given the facility to the migrant workers (stuck in green and orange zones) to go to their respective states.

Parab said, “The workers will have to make a group of 1,000 people and prepare a list mentioning each travellers name, village, district and the state (destination address) and mobile number along with their Aadhar card number. In addition to this, the migrants will also have to provide a doctor’s certificate stating that he/she does not have any symptoms”. The list needs to be submitted to the local police station.



The transport minister said that the list will be sent to the concerned states and once the respective states send an NOC (no objection certificate) to Maharashtra, the government will make arrangements for their travel.



“We are planning to start special trains for the same. As per the requirement, the trains will be arranged,” he added. The government is also mulling to start buses for them. The red zone districts include Mumbai, Pune, Thane, Nashik, Palghar, Nagpur, Solapur, Yavatmal, Aurangabad, Satara, Dhule, Akola, Jalgaon, Mumbai suburban.



Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday said that the coronavirus-induced lockdown restrictions will be lifted in the state in a zone-wise manner after May 3 and the rules will be relaxed cautiously. In a live webcast, he said the relaxation of rules will not be carried out in haste. The chief minister added that efforts are being made to phase out restrictions in the orange zone and green zone excluding infected areas in the orange zone.",https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/020520/no-relaxation-in-maharashtra-red-zones-uddhav-thackeray.html,Covid,/Jalgaon:Mumbai
