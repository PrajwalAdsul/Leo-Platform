Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday accused the government of taking away people's jobs and savings, failing to stop the spread of coronavirus and still showing them ""lofty false dreams"".

His attack came amid reports that people who have lost their jobs have been utilising their Employee Provident Fund (EPF) savings for sustaining a living during the lockdown period enforced due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""Snatched jobs, grabbed savings, could not even stop the disease from spreading. But they continued to show lofty false dreams,"" the Congress leader said in a tweet in Hindi, without naming the government.

2,8,"Health Ministry said ""India continues to be a country with one of the lowest fatality rates globally""

India's COVID-19 fatality rate is progressively falling from 3.33 per cent on June 18 to 2.25 per cent as on date, while the recovery rate increased from around 53 per cent in mid-June to more than 64 per cent, the Union health ministry said today.

With 35,176 patients discharged in a 24-hour span, the total recoveries surged to 9,52,743 and exceed the active coronavirus cases by 4,55,755, it said. ""The COVID-19 case fatality rate (CFR) has reduced from around 3.33 per cent in mid-June to 2.25 per cent today,"" the ministry said.

""India continues its march as a country with one of the lowest fatality rates in the world,"" it said while underlining that the achievement was a result of effective implementation of containment strategy combined with house-to-house surveys, aggressive testing and standardised clinical management protocols based on holistic standard of care approach.

The ministry said such an approach ensured that hospitals were left unburdened with supervised home isolation for asymptomatic patients.

Under the guidance of the central government, the state and Union territory (UT) governments have focused on reducing fatalities by effectively managing severe cases and prioritising care of the high-risk population using field healthcare workers, leading to decrease in the COVID-19 case fatality rate (CFR) across the country.

The ramped up three-tier hospital infrastructure along with prompt and seamless patient management has helped in consistent increase in the recoveries, it said.

For the fifth day in a row, India has seen more than 30,000 recoveries per day.

The recovery rate among coronavirus infected patients has seen a sharp increase from around 53 per cent in mid-June to 64.24 per cent as on Tuesday, according to the ministry data.

The actual active case load is presently 4,96,988 and all are under medical supervision.

The focused efforts on early detection and isolation along with hand-holding of states and Union Territories by expert teams of AIIMS, New Delhi for efficient clinical management of hospitalised cases and periodic visits of central teams, have borne results with continuously improving recovery rate, the ministry said.

With a single-day increase of 47,703 COVID-19 cases, India's infection tally mounted to 14,83,156 on Tuesday, while the number of deaths due to the disease rose to 33,425 with 654 fresh fatalities, the ministry data updated at 8 am showed.

3,9,"Chapter on Tipu Sultan dropped from class 7 social science textbook to reduce syllabus this year

The chapter on controversial 18th century Mysore ruler Tipu Sultan and his father Haider Ali are among those that have been dropped from the class 7 social science textbook, following the Karnataka government's decision to reduce the 2020-21 syllabi due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, the chapters on Tipu Sultan have been retained in the class 6 and 10 books, official sources told news agency Press Trust of India.

According to news agency PTI, the revised syllabus uploaded on the Karnataka Text Book Society (KTBS) website shows that in class 7, social science text, chapter 5 that deals with Haider Ali and Tipu Sultan, Historical places of Mysore, and Administration of Commissioners have been dropped.

The Department of Public Instructions decided to reduce the syllabus for the year 2020-21 in view of the pandemic and disruption in the academic calendar for the year, that has been brought down to 120 working days.

Responding to a question on dropping the chapter in class 7, officials said it should be noted that the students study about Tipu Sultan from classes 6 and 10.

A couple of months ago, amid the growing clamour from some BJP leaders to remove a chapter in the textbook glorifying Tipu Sultan, the government had constituted an expert committee to look into it.

The committee however had recommended that the ruler cannot be ignored from the school syllabus.

Commenting on the development, Karnataka Congress President DK Shivakumar said that the BJP government was taking such decisions with a political agenda in mind.

Pointing out that Tipu Sultan was a historical figure, Mr Shivakumar had said ""History is history...you cannot change history. We will not accept it. Congress will take it seriously by setting up a committee to look into it.""

Soon after coming to power, the BJP government in Karnataka had scrapped the birth anniversary celebrations of Tipu Sultan, an annual government event the party had been opposing since 2015 when it was launched during the Congress rule, led by Siddaramaiah.

The BJP and some other organisations have been strongly opposing Tipu Sultan, calling the erstwhile Mysore king a ""religious bigot"".

Tipu Sultan was considered an implacable enemy of the British East India Company. He was killed in May 1799 while defending his fort at Srirangapatnam against the British forces.

Tipu Sultan, however, is a controversial figure in Kodagu district as Kodavas (Coorgis), a martial race, believe that thousands of their men and women were held captive during his occupation and subjected to torture, death and forcible conversion to Islam.

He was also accused of execution of Mandyam Iyengars at the temple town of Melkote in Mandya district on the day of Deepawali as they supported the then Maharaja of Mysuru.

However, the scale of such suppression is disputed by several historians, as they see Tipu Sultan as a ruler who took on the might of the British.

While BJP and some other organisations see Tipu Sultan as a ""religious bigot"" and a ""brutal killer"", a few Kannada outfits call him ""anti-Kannada"", saying he had promoted Persian at the cost of the local language.

Sonu Sood has been reaching out to people hit hard by the lockdown and also donated a tractor to a farmer's family in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh.

A B.Tech in Computer Science, U Sharada was undeterred after losing her job and started selling vegetables to support her family. However, support started pouring in from several quarters, including start-ups.

5,14,"The ""One Nation One Ration Card"" system will include about 800 million people.

The coronavirus outbreak is accelerating a push to digitize India's food-rationing system, allowing citizens to receive entitlements anywhere in the country -- boosting labor mobility and the country's economic recovery.

The ""One Nation One Ration Card"" system will include about 800 million people under the world's biggest food-security program. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration is betting that nationwide portability of rations can help bring migrants back to cities after the world's largest lockdown -- imposed in March with just a few hours' notice -- left many without food or money.

Under the program, people are now allowed to take their quota of foodgrains from a ""fair-price shop"" anywhere in India by giving their ration card number and providing biometric authentication. Until now Indians could only receive the rations in their hometowns, which could discourage some from moving away in search of work.

""One of the key challenges faced by the migrant workers in the cities at the beginning of the lockdowns was the lack of food security and a lack of access to foodgrains,"" said Ashwajit Singh, managing director of New Delhi-based IPE Global Pvt Ltd., which advises several multinational aid agencies. ""It will certainly help get our labor force back into the cities.""

With India's economy headed for its worst year in more than four decades, PM Modi has allowed factories to reopen even as the country grapples with the third-most Covid-19 infections in the world.

India's annual food-subsidy bill is more than 1 trillion rupees ($13.4 billion) -- almost 4% of the national budget -- as the government is required by law to provide 5 kilograms (11 pounds) of rice, wheat and coarse grains at subsidized rates as low as 1 rupee per kilogram. After the pandemic began PM Modi announced an additional 6 kilos a month per person until November, at a cost of 1.5 trillion rupees.

""In a way, over 2.5 times the population of the United States, 12 times the population of the United Kingdom and double the population of the European Union was given a free ration by our government,"" PM Modi said last month.

Multiple challenges -- from lack of documentation to supply management to technological hiccups -- could prevent the program from being a true game changer, experts say.

The ration program ""is one of the measures that can reduce hardships for migrants, but they worry about other factors like decent housing, informality of employment, access to medical facilities, and the uncertainty surrounding the current pandemic,"" said Rajesh Bansal, senior adviser at Carnegie India. ""Incentives in the form of assured social security benefits are also essential.""",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/coronavirus-worlds-largest-food-scheme-goes-online-to-help-migrants-economy-2270321,Covid,2785
6,16,"When Sachin Pilot first rebelled against Ashok Gehlot, the issues seemed vaguely discernible. Pilot said that he had been humiliated and snubbed by the Chief Minister and was not going to take it any longer.

According to Congress mediators and the journalists he spoke to, Pilot wanted some assurances that he would be made Chief Minister after a suitable interval and that he would lead the party into the next assembly election.

This did not seem so unreasonable but apparently, Pilot also wanted a public declaration to this effect, which would amount to humiliating Gehlot - which the Congress leadership was unwilling to do.

But Pilot also gave the Congress a compelling reason to mollify him. He had the support of many MLAs, he said (at one stage, his camp claimed 30 MLAs). If the Congress did not agree to his demands, he could bring the government down.

This threat, along with the support of a sympathetic media which portrayed him as a potential Congress President who was being forced out to secure Rahul Gandhi's position, was enough to worry the Congress.

Ashok Gehlot, Rahul Gandhi and Sachin Pilot (File photo)

But the questions remained. Even if he brought down the Gehlot government, what would Pilot do next? Would he, like Jyotiraditya Scindia in Madhya Pradesh, take his followers and defect to the BJP?

Pilot must have known that within the Congress, negotiating with the BJP is one line you cannot cross. Sonia Gandhi believes that anyone who abandons the secular, liberal values the Congress stands for to join hands with the current hardline version of the BJP is not worth holding back.

So, ultimately, the revolt became about one question. Was Pilot acting on his own? Or had he been put up to it by the BJP?

Pilot answered by denying that he was in league with the BJP. He had fought the BJP all his life, he said, why would he want to join now?

Ashok Gehlot said the opposite was true. The plot, he said, had been hatched by the BJP, which had paid large sums to the dissident MLAs and hoped to topple his government. Pilot he claimed, was lying when he denied any truck with the BJP.

Phase One of Pilot's revolt failed because he did not attract enough MLAs to imperil Gehlot's government. The Congress 'high command', for once, played its cards shrewdly. While Gehlot raved and ranted, the central leadership struck to its position that it wanted Pilot to stay with the party. This was never a realistic option: how could he have re-joined Gehlot's government and what could he possibly have been offered at the centre? But it squashed the criticism that Rahul wanted Pilot out to preserve his own position.

Sachin Pilot (File photo)

Since then, however, the situation has become much more ambiguous. Pilot is generally regarded as a thoughtful and cautious man. So he must have had a Plan B. But so far, no such plan has appeared. Instead, he has sought asylum in BJP-ruled Haryana, where he is keeping his MLAs in a resort under the benign gaze of the state government.

Given that negotiations with the Congress have broken down and that the party has largely accepted Gehlot's claim that the BJP helped purchase MLAs for Pilot's revolt - Gehlot has produced audiotapes - that door is now firmly shut.

The only Plan B possible is for Pilot to sit it out till the Congress government falls. That could take time. Gehlot has held on to his majority. So the effort has to be to delay and delay till Gehlot's resistance collapses and his MLAs run out of patience.

And indeed, that is what the BJP is doing. The Governor has asked Gehlot to wait 21 days to hold a session of the assembly where he can prove his majority. Various central government agencies have raided Gehlot's donors to make it difficult for the Congress to join any kind of bidding war. The High Court (which the Pilot camp approached) has taken its time and has given no joy to Gehlot. Cases are being prepared against Gehlot's family.

If the Governor can hold firm and refuse to let an assembly session be called for three weeks, then the BJP may well succeed in toppling another Congress government. It only needs to ""win over"" a few MLAs for Gehlot to lose his majority.

Rajasthan Governor Kalraj Mishra with Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot

So what then for Pilot? Over the last week, he has vanished from view. His MLAs seem to have been quietly grounded, like a squadron without a lead Pilot.

Instead, this has become a battle between Gehlot and the massed armies of the central government. It is hard now to even recall that this toppling operation was caused by Pilot's complaints about Gehlot. This is no internal Congress battle now. This is Amit Shah in action.

If Pilot has a Plan B, it will emerge once the Gehlot government falls. He can't join the BJP after so many denials. So he will probably form a regional party and may align with the BJP, and hope that power-hungry Congressmen will desert a fallen Gehlot and join the regional grouping.

He could once again be Deputy Chief Minister in a new BJP-led coalition and his MLAs could get ministeries. And then, who knows, one day in the future, he could align with the Congress again if he needs to, or if the next election throws up a hung assembly. Or, if the Congress leadership changes over the years, he could even come back to the party in triumph.

All these options collapse, of course, if Gehlot is not toppled by the BJP. Which is why Delhi has turned on the heat. That is why the central government is treating this like a fight to the finish.

It will take everything he has (and a little more) for Gehlot to survive this onslaught.

Otherwise, it is one more opposition government down. And one more step towards the fulfilment of Amit Shah's dream of a Congress-mukt Bharat.

7,18,"Rajasthan: Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Monday said he had spoken with PM Modi.

Highlights On Monday, Governor Kalraj Mishra wrote to the Chief Minister

He said he was not against calling an assembly session

Governor also said it would be difficult to call all MLAs at short notice

The Rajasthan Congress government today sent, for the third time, its recommendation for an assembly session from July 31 to the Governor, who has blocked two previous requests. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot met his cabinet earlier this morning to discuss Governor Kalraj Mishra's three conditions, which included a 21-day notice and a coronavirus plan for the house.

The revised proposal does not mention whether the state government wants a trust vote in the assembly session. It also asserts that the Ashok Gehlot government has a majority.

""We have a majority. We will prove it if we think it necessary,"" Rajasthan minister Harish Chaudhary told NDTV after the meeting.

On Monday, the Governor wrote to the Chief Minister that he was not against calling an assembly session. ""The Raj Bhavan (Governor) gives the go ahead to call the Assembly session keeping in mind the suggestions made,"" he wrote, listing questions that needed to be dealt with.

He asked whether the Chief Minister wanted to bring a trust vote; if that is the case, a 21-day notice is not needed. ""Do you want to bring a confidence motion? As it is not mentioned in the proposal but in public you (Mr Gehlot) are making statements that you want to bring a Confidence Motion,"" Mr Mishra had questioned.

The Governor also said it would be difficult to call all MLAs at short notice during the pandemic. ""Can you consider giving 21 days' notice to the MLAs?"" - his note asked. The government has said that assembly sessions have been held in Goa, Manipur and Puducherry in the middle of the virus fight.

His third question was on how social distancing would be maintained during the session. To that, Team Gehlot has said in its latest request that it is up to the Speaker to decide on safety measures and seating arrangements.

When he rejected Mr Gehlot's first proposal on Friday, the Governor had given six reasons. He had said the proposal did not mention any agenda or date. He had also pointed out that a case was being heard in the Supreme Court. To tackle the last point, Rajasthan Speaker CP Joshi dropped a petition in the Supreme Court involving his powers to disqualify Sachin Pilot and 19 other rebel MLAs.

The Chief Minister has been pressing for an assembly session since last week and protested for five hours at the Governor's residence last Friday.

Facing a rebellion by his sacked deputy Sachin Pilot, Mr Gehlot believes he has the numbers to win a floor test in the assembly. The Chief Minister submitted to the Governor a list of 102 MLAs, just one past the majority mark of 101 in the 200-member Rajasthan assembly.

What could endanger the Gehlot government's thin lead is the status of six Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLAs who merged their party with the Congress last year. The BSP and BJP have challenged the merger in court. BSP chief Mayawati said she could have gone to court earlier but was waiting for the right time to ""teach the Congress and Gehlot a lesson"".",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/rajasthan-ashok-gehlot-holds-cabinet-meeting-day-after-governor-kalraj-mishra-sends-back-request-for-assembly-session-with-queries-2269919,Riot,

However, despite the encouraging numbers, the rate at which the infection is spreading in the country remained far higher than US and Brazil - the two worst-hit nations in the world and the only ones currently above India in total cases.

A seven-day moving average of the daily rise in coronavirus cases showed India increasing its tally at 3.6 per cent on Tuesday, significantly higher than US at 1.7 per cent and Brazil at 2.4 per cent.

If the rate is not brought down, India risks crossing the US as the country with the highest number of cases in little over two months.",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/coronavirus-fewer-cases-in-3-states-helps-india-cut-daily-covid-19-tally-from-50-000-2270270,Riot,
