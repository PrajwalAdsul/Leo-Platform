A visually impaired couple making a living by selling incense sticks in this district were shocked to learn their hard earned cash savings of Rs 24,000 was worthless, being in Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes demonetised nearly four years ago.

Somu (58) of remote Pothiya Moopanure village claimed he came to know about the scrapping of the high-value currency notes in November, 2016 only on Friday when he took the savings of him and his wife Palaniammal to deposit in a bank.

They chose to tap the reserve, kept with the man’s illiterate mother, as they could not make earnings in the last four months owing to Covid-19 lockdown, he told reporters on Saturday.

Somu had taken the cash to a bank for depositing when the officials there told him that the notes were demonetised.

He said the money was saved by him and his wife over ten years from sale of incense sticks and camphor in nearby Anthiyur and surrounding areas.

Every week, he used to handover some money with his mother living with them and she kept it carefully. On a regular interval, he used to convert the cash into Rs 500 or Rs 1,000, he said.

All the three were not aware of the demonetisation of Rs 1,000 and Rs 5,000 currencies, he maintained.

Somu said he has sent a memorandum to Tamil Nadu Chief Minister K Palaniswami to help his family.

Police said they would inquire into the matter.

In a similar case last year, two elderly sisters in neighbouring Tirupur district found their live-time savings of Rs 46,000 were in the demonetised Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 currency notes.

India and the European Union (EU) will focus on strengthening multilateralism during their upcoming summit this week amid uncertainty created by the Covid-19 pandemic and the rise of an assertive China, people familiar with developments said on Sunday.

The 15th India-EU Summit, which was delayed due to the coronavirus outbreak, will be held via video conference on July 15. The summit will be co-chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

The people cited above, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said both sides felt the need to take the lead in bolstering multilateralism and cooperative international relations against the backdrop of the US ceding its leading role on the world stage.

“This has created a vacuum that needs to be plugged, or else an aggressive China will only become more assertive,” one of the people cited above said. “The whole multilateral system is under stress and many experts have expressed doubts about the future of the global system.”

In a blog titled “In a world of disorder, Europe needs partners” written on July 10, the EU’s high representative for foreign and security policy, Josep Borrell Fontelles, noted that China has become increasingly assertive, while the Covid-19 pandemic was the first major world crisis “where the US is not in the lead” as the US administration has “mostly withdrawn from the global order it has built”.

He further wrote of a “real crisis of multilateralism”, with the G7 and G20 being absent and the UN Security Council paralysed. He added: “Europe feels somewhat lonely, trying to hold the multilateral ring. For sure we know that we need partners.”

Some preparatory work has already been done in this regard and external affairs minister S Jaishankar joined his European and other counterparts for a virtual meeting of the informal Alliance for Multilateralism on June 26, the people said.

This alliance was launched by France and Germany in April 2019 after they felt the need to protect the rules-based multilateral order to ensure international stability and to resolve common challenges through cooperation.

The alliance met in February and April before holding a virtual ministerial meeting on June 26. While participating in that meeting, Jaishankar reiterated India’s call for reformed multilateralism along with purposeful reform of existing structures so that they continue to serve the world even more in this complex and uncertain time.

Jaishankar also referred to the two-pronged attack of “a viral pandemic and misinformation going viral”, and highlighted the need to strengthen scientific approaches to analyse the causes of the Covid-19 pandemic, assess multilateral health mechanisms, and take concrete steps to counter the “infodemic” in the context of a statement adopted by more than 130 states and observers on Covid-19 at the UN.

The EU has already stated that multilateralism, with the UN and the World Trade Organisation (WTO) at its core, is the cornerstone of the grouping’s foreign and security policy. As part of its efforts to strengthen multilateralism, the EU intends to act on three fronts – upholding international norms and agreements, extending multilateralism to new global realities, and reforming multilateral organisations.

In a recent letter to the prime minister, European Commission President von der Leyen suggested common engagement of India and the EU for effective multilateralism and a cooperative approach to international ties, based on their shared values of democracy and pluralism.

The people said India is hoping the July 15 summit can frame their partnership to preserve multilateralism and promote dialogue and cooperation to address global challenges.

The external affairs ministry earlier said the summit will review India-EU cooperation in political and security relations, trade and investment, and economic cooperation. The summit is also expected to discuss developments related to the pandemic.

The EU, in a statement, said the summit will be an opportunity to strengthen the strategic partnership between the two sides and to discuss cooperation in climate, environment, digital economy and connectivity.

The National Commission for Women (NCW) has sought immediate action from Gujarat Police against a man for allegedly hurling abuses and giving rape threats to a female stand-up comedian on social media.

In a letter to Gujarat Director General of Police (DGP) Shivanand Jha, the NCW said it has been tagged in a video posted on Twitter in which the man can be seen hurling abuses and giving rape threats to the woman. “The NCW is committed to creating safe online space for women and ensuring cyber security to women and is perturbed by the rise in use of cyberspace to instigate crime against women,” NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma said in the letter sent late Saturday night.

As the Trump administration pushes full steam ahead to force schools to resume in-person education, public health experts warn that a one-size-fits-all reopening could drive infection and death rates even higher.

They’re urging a more cautious approach, which many local governments and school districts are already pursuing.

There are too many uncertainties and variables, they say, for back-to-school to be back-to-normal.

Where is the virus spreading rapidly? Do students live with aged grandparents? Do teachers have high-risk health conditions that would make online teaching safest? Do infected children easily spread COVID-19 to each other and to adults?

Regarding the latter, some evidence suggests they don’t, but a big government study aims to find better proof. Results won’t be available before the fall, and some schools are slated to reopen in just a few weeks.

“These are complicated issues. You can’t just charge straight ahead,” Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Wednesday during an online briefing.

Children infected with coronavirus are more likely than adults to have mild illnesses, but their risk for severe disease and death isn’t zero. While a virus-linked inflammatory condition is uncommon, most children who develop it require intensive care, and a few have died. Doctors don’t know which children are at risk.

“The single most important thing we can do to keep our schools safe has nothing to do with what happens in school. It’s how well we control COVID-19 in the community,” Frieden said. “Right now there are places around the country where the virus is spreading explosively and it would be difficult if not impossible to operate schools safely until the virus is under better control.”

Zahrah Wattier teaches high school in Galveston, Texas, where cases and deaths have been spiking. Until the state recently said schools must reopen to in-person classes, her district had been weighing options many others are considering, including full-time online teaching or a hybrid mix.

Wattier’s school has mostly Hispanic and Black students, many from low-income families; almost 70% qualify for free or reduced-cost lunches and many have parents who work in “essential” jobs that increase potential exposure to the virus. Online education was hard for many with limited internet access, and Wattier knows in-person classes can help even the playing field.

But she’s worried.

“My school has over 2,000 students. That’s over 2,000 exposures in a day,” she said. “It’s a lot to think about. It’s my job. It’s something I choose to do, it’s something I love. Now it comes at a really high risk.’’

She also worries about her 2-year-old twins in day care and a 4-year-old who has asthma and is starting preschool. Her parents live with the family and they’re both high-risk.

The American Academy of Pediatrics, whose guidance the Trump administration has cited to support its demands, says the goal is for all students to be physically present in school. But it says school districts need to be flexible, consult with public health authorities and be ready to pivot as virus activity waxes and wanes.

“It is not that the American Academy of Pediatrics thinks this is a done deal because we have put out guidance,” said Dr. Nicholas Beers, a member of the academy’s school health council. “But what we do know is that we need to have a more realistic dialogue about the implications of virtual learning on the future of children. We have left whole swaths of society behind, whether it’s because they have limited access to a computer, or broadband internet,” or because of other challenges that online education can’t address.

Following academy guidelines would mean big changes for most schools. Mask-wearing would be strongly encouraged for adult staff and students except the youngest. Desks would be distanced at least 3 feet apart; the CDC recommends 6 feet. Both the academy and the CDC suggest limiting adults allowed in schools, including parents, and canceling group activities like choir and assemblies. Staggered arrival and dismissal times, outdoor classes, and keeping kids in the same classroom all day are other options.

President Donald Trump has threatened federal funding cuts for districts that don’t fully reopen. While most funding typically comes from state and local sources, experts say schools will need more federal funding, not less, to reopen safely. Masks, extra cleaning supplies or janitors, additional classroom space, mental health support for students and staff traumatized by the pandemic are among potential costs. And with more parents out of work, more children will qualify for federally funded school lunches.

Lynn Morales, 49, teaches 8th grade English at a high-poverty public school in Bloomington, Minnesota. Her district is considering several options including in-person classes; a final decision is expected Aug. 1.

Some colleagues are considering not returning to the classroom because their children’s day care centers aren’t reopening. Some say they won’t come back until there’s a vaccine.

“I am concerned and it’s because of the age group,” Morales said. ‘’Middle school students ... are lovely and I love them, but they touch, they get close, they roughhouse. It is their nature. They’re 13 years old. They are defiant.”

“If masks are required and a kid isn’t wearing a mask, is my job description going to be to chase down this kid and insist they wear a mask? And what if they don’t?’’

She’s heard outrage from parents angry at the prospect of some schools not reopening or incredulous about sending kids back into classrooms.

‘’There is no win-win,’’ she said. ‘’Teachers are used to being scapegoats. This is just a whole new level of anger.’’

Dr. Emily Landon, a University of Chicago infectious disease specialist, is helping the university and a campus preK-12 school decide how to reopen safely.

“Things are evolving from, ‘We can’t do it unless it’s perfectly safe’ to more of a harm reduction model, with the caveat that you can always step back” if virus activity flares, Landon said.

Single-occupancy dorms, outdoor classes, socially distanced classrooms and mask-wearing by students and faculty are on tap for the university. Face coverings will be required at the school too. Policies may change depending on virus activity.

She dismisses complaints from some parents who say masks are a loss of personal freedom.

“It’s not harmful for your child,” she said. “If you see wearing masks as a loss of personal freedom, then you have to think the same of pants.”

Dr. Tina Hartert of Vanderbilt University is leading a National Institutes of Health-funded study aiming to determine what role children play in transmitting COVID-19. Almost 2,000 families are enrolled and self-test every two weeks. The idea is to find infected children without symptoms and see how easily disease spreads within families. Results may come by year’s end.

“If we don’t see significant transmission within households, that would be very reassuring,” Hartert said.

She noted that in other countries where schools have reopened, evidence suggests no widespread transmission from children.

In France, public schools reopened briefly before a summer break, with no sign of widespread virus transmission. Masks were only required for upper grades, but students stayed in the same classroom all day. Frequent hand-washing was mandatory. A better test will be when the new school year starts Sept. 1.

In Norway, schools closed in March for several weeks. Nursery schools reopened first, then other grades. Children were put in smaller groups that stay together all day. Masks aren’t required. There have been only a few virus cases, said Dr. Margrethe Greve-Isdahl of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, but she noted virus activity is much lower than in the U.S.

Kati Spaniak, a realtor in Northbrook, Illinois, says her five teenage daughters have struggled to cope with pandemic fears, school closures and deficits of online learning. She strongly supports getting kids back in the classroom, and all her girls will return to some form of that in the fall.

It’s been hard for her high school senior, Kylie Ciesla. Prom, graduation and other senior rituals were canceled, and there were no good-byes. “Just to get ripped away from everything I’ve worked for 12 years, it’s really hard,” Kylie said.

At college, classes will be in person, masks mandated and a COVID-19 test required before she can move into her dorm. Kylie isn’t sure all that is needed.

“I hate that this thing has become so political. I just want the science. I want to know what we need to do to fix it,” she said.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-spread-not-politics-should-guide-schools-doctors-say/story-hVojoU5kxmoDqUnLpQ1BnM.html,Covid,

Tanusri Dasgupta, the creative head of Ekta Kapoor’s production house Balaji Telefilms, has tested positive for Covid-19. She was hospitalised on Saturday night and is hopeful about being back home soon.

In an interview with India Forums, Tanusri said that her mother is also Covid-19 positive and has been under home quarantine. “I was brought to the hospital on Saturday night when I hit a low on oxygen. The doctor did a blood test and advised me to get admitted so that I can be monitored. Before that, I was at home with my mother who had also tested positive. But she did not need to be hospitalised. She was home quarantined and is on her way to recovery,” she said.

Tanusri said that it was ‘scary’ initially but she is confident that she will be back on her feet soon. “I caught a deeper strain I think and had to be admitted. The staff here has been extremely helpful in nursing me back to health. I still have a cough due to bronchitis and am being treated for the same. Yes, it was scary for a few days, but if you are in good hands there is no fear. We all are recovering and I will be back home soon,” she said.

Television actor Parth Samthaan also tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday. The shoot of the Kasautii Zindagii Kay reboot has been halted, and cast and crew members who came in contact with him are getting tested. His co-stars Pooja Banerjee and Shubhavi Choksey were tested on Sunday.

Aishwarya Rai,46, and daughter Aaradhya Bachchan, 8, tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday afternoon, hours after the two were reported to have tested negative for the virus. Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar was quoted as saying that the actor and her daughter had tested negative but the results came otherwise within hours.

As per BMC, Aishwarya and Aaradhya’s swab samples were taken for RT-PCR test on Saturday. Their positive reports came on Sunday. So here’s why they tested negative earlier: Just like reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), rapid antigen test detects the presence of molecular pathogens of coronavirus in people. But unlike RT-PCR which takes almost 8 hours to provide results, the latter gives reports within 30 minutes. The antigen-based test uses nasal swab samples for testing. According to protocol, every positive report from the rapid antigen testing is treated as ‘true positive’, while negative samples are mandatorily re-tested by RT-PCR process.

So, when the test reports of Aishwarya and Aaradhya came negative in rapid antigen tests at the hospital on Saturday, their samples were taken for RT-PCR test. On Sunday, their RT-PCR results came positive.

The 15th India-EU Summit, which was delayed due to the coronavirus outbreak, will be held via video conference on July 15. The summit will be co-chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

The people cited above, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said both sides felt the need to take the lead in bolstering multilateralism and cooperative international relations against the backdrop of the US ceding its leading role on the world stage.

“This has created a vacuum that needs to be plugged, or else an aggressive China will only become more assertive,” one of the people cited above said. “The whole multilateral system is under stress and many experts have expressed doubts about the future of the global system.”

In a blog titled “In a world of disorder, Europe needs partners” written on July 10, the EU’s high representative for foreign and security policy, Josep Borrell Fontelles, noted that China has become increasingly assertive, while the Covid-19 pandemic was the first major world crisis “where the US is not in the lead” as the US administration has “mostly withdrawn from the global order it has built”.

He further wrote of a “real crisis of multilateralism”, with the G7 and G20 being absent and the UN Security Council paralysed. He added: “Europe feels somewhat lonely, trying to hold the multilateral ring. For sure we know that we need partners.”

Some preparatory work has already been done in this regard and external affairs minister S Jaishankar joined his European and other counterparts for a virtual meeting of the informal Alliance for Multilateralism on June 26, the people said.

This alliance was launched by France and Germany in April 2019 after they felt the need to protect the rules-based multilateral order to ensure international stability and to resolve common challenges through cooperation.

The alliance met in February and April before holding a virtual ministerial meeting on June 26. While participating in that meeting, Jaishankar reiterated India’s call for reformed multilateralism along with purposeful reform of existing structures so that they continue to serve the world even more in this complex and uncertain time.

Jaishankar also referred to the two-pronged attack of “a viral pandemic and misinformation going viral”, and highlighted the need to strengthen scientific approaches to analyse the causes of the Covid-19 pandemic, assess multilateral health mechanisms, and take concrete steps to counter the “infodemic” in the context of a statement adopted by more than 130 states and observers on Covid-19 at the UN.

The EU has already stated that multilateralism, with the UN and the World Trade Organisation (WTO) at its core, is the cornerstone of the grouping’s foreign and security policy. As part of its efforts to strengthen multilateralism, the EU intends to act on three fronts – upholding international norms and agreements, extending multilateralism to new global realities, and reforming multilateral organisations.

In a recent letter to the prime minister, European Commission President von der Leyen suggested common engagement of India and the EU for effective multilateralism and a cooperative approach to international ties, based on their shared values of democracy and pluralism.

The people said India is hoping the July 15 summit can frame their partnership to preserve multilateralism and promote dialogue and cooperation to address global challenges.

The external affairs ministry earlier said the summit will review India-EU cooperation in political and security relations, trade and investment, and economic cooperation. The summit is also expected to discuss developments related to the pandemic.

The EU, in a statement, said the summit will be an opportunity to strengthen the strategic partnership between the two sides and to discuss cooperation in climate, environment, digital economy and connectivity.

The last India-EU Summit was held in New Delhi in October 2017. The EU is India’s largest trading partner, accounting for trade in goods worth 80 billion euros in 2019 or 11.1% of total Indian trade, on par with the US and ahead of China.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-eu-summit-to-focus-on-multilateral-order-in-face-of-increasingly-assertive-china/story-fKtuFbti9en3gXQ47NssaI.html,Covid,

Balaji Telefilms, producers of Kasautii Zindagii Kay, said in a statement, “We would like to inform various stakeholders that one of our talent from the show Kasautii Zindagii Kay has tested positive for COVID-19 and is now receiving medical attention. Our first priority is to help protect our talent, production crew and employees. We are taking all the precautions detailed in the guideline.

Ekta Kapoor of Balaji Telefilms shared the production house’s statement on her Instagram stories and wrote, “All necessary precautions being taken, SOPs being followed. Health & safety comes first to us all at Balaji. Take care. Jai Mata Di!”

SpotboyeE reports that Parth underwent a test after experiencing symptoms on Saturday morning. He was not present for the shoot on Sunday. His Kasautii Zindagii Kay co-stars Pooja Banerjee (who plays Nivedita Basu) and Shubhavi Choksey (who plays Mohini Basu) are on the set and have been asked to undergo tests. Officials of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation have already arrived. Pooja told the website, “Yes there is test happening and I’m on set right now.”

Parth, who flew to Hyderabad once domestic flight services resumed, returned to Mumbai to resume the Kasautii Zindagii Kay shoot last month. The show also stars Erica Fernandes, Karan Patel and Pooja Banerjee, among others.

Earlier this month, Parth opened up on experiencing ‘moments of depression’ during the lockdown and thanked his friends, fans and well-wishers for helping him overcome the low phase. “Yes there were moments of depression and sadness during this lockdown, but that’s what gives us strength to be stronger and push ourselves so that one day when this pandemic is over .. We are Ready !!! To face this world againnnn !!!!,” he wrote in an Instagram post.

Parth has acted in shows such as Best Friends Forever? and Kaisi Yeh Yaariyaan. He also announced earlier this year that he will play a gangster in the ALT Balaji web series Mai Hero Boll Raha Hu.

Aishwarya Rai,46, and daughter Aaradhya Bachchan, 8, tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday afternoon, hours after the two were reported to have tested negative for the virus. Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar was quoted as saying that the actor and her daughter had tested negative but the results came otherwise within hours.

As per BMC, Aishwarya and Aaradhya’s swab samples were taken for RT-PCR test on Saturday. Their positive reports came on Sunday. So here’s why they tested negative earlier: Just like reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), rapid antigen test detects the presence of molecular pathogens of coronavirus in people. But unlike RT-PCR which takes almost 8 hours to provide results, the latter gives reports within 30 minutes. The antigen-based test uses nasal swab samples for testing. According to protocol, every positive report from the rapid antigen testing is treated as ‘true positive’, while negative samples are mandatorily re-tested by RT-PCR process.

So, when the test reports of Aishwarya and Aaradhya came negative in rapid antigen tests at the hospital on Saturday, their samples were taken for RT-PCR test. On Sunday, their RT-PCR results came positive.

Rajasthan Congress MLA Rohit Bohra, one of the three MLAs who had visited the national capital on Saturday and is believed to be supporting Sachin Pilot, on Sunday said that he had visited Delhi for personal reasons, news agency ANI reported.

“We went to Delhi due to personal reasons. If the media says we went there for this reason or that, then it’s not our problem. We don’t want to be part of any controversy. We are the soldiers of Congress and will be with the party till our last breath,” Bohra said.

The crisis in the Rajasthan Congress escalated on Sunday with Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and his deputy Sachin Pilot at loggerheads, with the CM blaming the BJP for attempting to topple the state government by poaching MLAs.

Deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot is camping in Delhi to speak to the party leadership regarding the political turmoil in the state.

On Sunday evening, Rajasthan Congress MLAs said, “The Congress stands united,” at a press conference, which was also attended by Rohit Bohra. Bohra said that his visit to Delhi had been personal and he had happened to meet the other two MLAs in the capital.

The Congress Legislature Party is slated to meet at the Rajasthan CM’s residence at 10:30 am on Monday. CM Gehlot has also called a meeting of Congress lawmakers in Jaipur tonight to discuss the political crisis.

Earlier in the day, Gehlot said on Twitter that the special operations group (SOG) has sent notices to the Chief Minister, Deputy CM, Chief Whip, some other ministers and MLAs in connection with the Congress Legislative Party’s complaint about poaching of MLAs by BJP.

In the 200-member Rajasthan assembly, the Congress has 107 MLAs and has support the of another 18, taking its tally to 125. The BJP has 72 legislators and is supported by three MLAs of Hanuman Beniwal’s RSLP. In the Rajya Sabha elections on June 19, the two Congress candidates got votes of all 125 legislators supporting the government.

Even as the nation battles the Covid-19 pandemic, political suspense has gripped the state of Rajasthan. Barely months after Jyotiraditya Scindia’s exit from the Congress party precipitated the fall of the Kamal Nath government in Madhya Pradesh, there is speculation of a similar fate for the Ashok Gehlot government in Rajasthan. Tension between CM Gehlot and his deputy, Sachin Pilot, has been apparent ever since the government was formed. But things seem to have reached a head with Pilot now camping in Delhi with more than a dozen legislators. The final straw that broke the camel’s back seems to be an investigation by the special operations group (SOG) of the state police’s anti-terror squad. The SOG issued a summons to Deputy CM Pilot to appear for questioning after the arrest of two alleged BJP workers accused of trying to topple the Congress government. Gehlot has claimed that he received a similar notice and it was a routine practice by investigators. As a political blame game rages on, watch what Congress’ Gourav Vallabh, and BJP’s Rajeev Jaitley have to say about the apparent political instability in Rajasthan.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/videos/in-focus/rajasthan-political-thriller-gehlot-pilot-tussle-sog-probe-resort-politics/video-MOGQ6euneayf05I2ouNplI.html,Covid,
