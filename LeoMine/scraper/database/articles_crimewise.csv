HYDERABAD: A fortnight after Molotov cocktails (bottles filled with flammable liquid and with a means of ignition) were hurled into a place of worship in Old City, two youths were arrested on Monday night. According to police, the accused duo had taken part in CAA/NRC protests, damaged an ATM centre and an RTC bus before targeting the place of worship.Task Force team nabbed the offenders from their houses in Chandrayangutta and handed them over to Madannapet police for judicial remand. “The accused have confessed to committing the offences. They will be produced before the magistrate,” Madannapet police said. A case was registered under section 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) of IPC against the duo.The secretary of a worship place in Madannapet had lodged a complaint with police on March 14, alleging that some unidentified persons had hurled a petrol bomb into the worship place premises. “Broken pieces of the bottle were found in front of the worship place’s door at 4.30 am when one of the workers went there to open it. When the premises was searched, two more petrol bombs were found atop the worship place,” the complainant said.Taskforce Additional DCP G Chakravarthi said during the interrogation, the duo confessed that during protests against CAA and NRC, they had resorted to acts of arson by setting fire to a private bank"

KOLKATA: Anarchy took over the Jadavpur University campus on Thursday evening as around 200 supporters of ABVP stormed the premises wearing bike helmets, armed with sticks and bottles. They ransacked the Arts union room near gate No. 4, the ground-floor corridor of the UG Arts building, set fire to at least six cycles and blocked the road outside the university for over an hour.The rampage began around 7pm and continued for over an hour. The group dispersed only after they had confirmation from their own leaders that central minister Babul Supriyo and governor Jagdeep Dhankhar had left the campus through another gate. Members of Durga Vahini, the women’s wing of Vishwa Hindu Parishad, also joined in the mayhem.When the marauding crowd finally left the campus around 8.15pm, it left behind bonfires that the fire brigade had to douse. ABVP was painted all over a union room and all the furniture smashed. At least one student and an amateur photographer suffered head injuries.Tea stalls outside the university were also set on fire. Pedestrians who had to walk the distance after traffic movement was stalled on Raja SC Mullick Road ran helter-skelter after being chased by ABVP supporters. “I was taking photographs of the protest when a group of ABVP supporters attacked me and snatched my camera. They hit me on the head with a stick. I ran into the university, where students gave me some first aid and later rushed me to hospital,” said Subhasis Das, a resident of Mukundapur, an amateur documentary filmmaker.Homemaker Sarmishtha Das had to scamper past the campus clutching her 14-year-old daughter in school uniform. “We had stopped to see what had happened, when a group of youths set fire to a cycle and began chasing everyone around, brandishing sticks. It was scary,” said the Baghajatin resident.University students said almost all men who were behind the attack were outsiders and had entered the campus to cause trouble. “Since afternoon, we had been organising a peaceful protest against BJP leader Babul Supriyo on our campus. Ours was an organised political programme but at no point did the protest turn violent. But look at what ABVP has done. They have brought in people from outside and vandalised our campus and spread panic outside,” said Roumya Chandra, a second-year postgraduate student of international relations.ABVP supporters said they had to call in reinforcements as there were only 50 of them on campus when hundreds of students gheraoed the minister, who was invited by ABVP to a freshers’ programme. “Since the authorities were not willing to call police and protesters were not even willing to listen to the appeals of the governor and gheraoed him on campus with the minister, we had to call our members from other colleges. That was the only way we had to get the guests out of the campus safely,” said Suranjan Sarkar, an ABVP leader and a first-year postgraduate student of mass communication.On why they had resorted to such violence, another ABVP leader, who is not a student at the university, said: “Any action will have consequences. SFI and TMC supporters had been assaulting our supporters since the afternoon and even molested one of our senior leaders. How long could we tolerate such things,” said Deep Biswas, a senior ABVP leader.The vandalism left JU students and teachers in shock. Samantak Das, professor of comparative literature, stood in disbelief seeing cops guarding JU’s main gate, with ABVP supporters setting fire to cycles of guards and students. His motorbike, too, was damaged. Nandini Mukherjee, a computer science and engineering professor, said: “I have never witnessed violence like this on campus. This is not the Jadavpur University I have known for long. I am scared for the students.”A police officer sent to the spot pleaded helplessness. “We cannot take any action on the campus unless we are asked by the authorities. When the protesters blocked the road outside, we tried to pacify them and did our best to limit the trouble to one area,” said a senior Kolkata Police officer."

Ujjain: A major fire broke out in the record room of Vikramaditya administrative block of Ujjain destroying important documents in the early hours of Wednesday.The fire started on the second floor of the block at Kothi Palace at around 1 am and soon spread across the room filled with a huge stock of paper, sub-divisional magistrate RP Tiwari said.“Old records of the divisional commissioner’s office were destroyed in the fire. The cause of the fire is not known, but chances of arson can’t be ruled out. Police are investigating the matter,” he said.The first information of the fire was received by the police control room, following which the fire brigade sprung into action. The fire was doused after nearly four hours of toil.“Six water tankers made 10 trips to the site and used 50,000 l water to douse the flames,” fire officer Ajay Singh Rajput told TOI adding that most of the files stored in the record room were lost – both in the fire and water used to douse it.Sources said the documents were of four decades from 1960 and contained information about revenue related matters.The Kothi Palace, where the administrative block is situated, is a 125-year-old building. The record room was kept locked. Firefighters found that the doors were completely destroyed and the locks were broken, indicating forced entry.ASP Rupesh Dwivedi said Madhav Nagar police station has registered a case of fire. “We are also exploring the arson angle. A forensic team was on the spot to probe the matter,” he said.Police were sifting through CCTV footages of localities nearby to check movement of any perpetrator."

LONDON: On April 2, a wireless tower was set ablaze in Birmingham. The next day, a fire was reported at 10 p.m. at a telecommunications box in Liverpool. An hour later, an emergency call came in about another cell tower in Liverpool that was going up in flames.Across Britain, more than 30 acts of arson and vandalism have taken place against wireless towers and other telecom gear this month, according to police reports and a telecom trade group. In roughly 80 other incidents in the country, telecom technicians have been harassed on the job.The attacks were fueled by the same cause, government officials said: an internet conspiracy theory that links the spread of the coronavirus to an ultrafast wireless technology known as 5G. Under the false idea, which has gained momentum in Facebook groups, WhatsApp messages and YouTube videos, radio waves sent by 5G technology are causing small changes to people’s bodies that make them succumb to the virus.The incidents starkly demonstrate how coronavirus conspiracy theories have taken a dark turn by spilling out into the real world. In just a few weeks, the pandemic has given preexisting fringe ideas online new urgency by playing on people’s fears.Before the coronavirus, rarely did such theories cause as much tangible harm so quickly, disinformation researchers said.In the United States, one person died after self-medicating with chloroquine, which was touted online as a miracle cure for the coronavirus even though its efficacy is unproven. And Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was assigned more security this month after unfounded theories spread that he was part of a secret cabal working to undermine President Donald Trump.“Most conspiracies stay online, but this is having real-world impact,” said Alexandre Alaphilippe , executive director of the EU DisinfoLab, a Brussels-based group tracking virus conspiracy theories. He called managing pandemic misinformation “a new problem” because the disease is global and people everywhere are hunting for information.The false theory linking 5G to the coronavirus has been especially prominent, amplified by celebrities like John Cusack and Woody Harrelson on social media. It has also been stoked by a vocal anti-5G contingent, who have urged people to take action against telecom gear to protect themselves.The idea has deep internet roots. An analysis by The New York Times found 487 Facebook communities, 84 Instagram accounts, 52 Twitter accounts, and dozens of other posts and videos pushing the conspiracy. The Facebook communities added nearly half a million new followers over the past two weeks. On Instagram, a network of 40 accounts nearly doubled its audience this month to 58,800 followers.On YouTube, the 10 most popular 5G coronavirus conspiracy videos posted in March were viewed over 5.8 million times. Today, the conspiracy can be found on Facebook in over 30 countries, including Switzerland, Uruguay and Japan.British politicians said the conspiracy theory and the violent acts it was causing were unacceptable.“This is nonsense of the absolute highest order,” said Julian Knight, a member of Parliament who leads a committee investigating coronavirus-related online misinformation. He said Facebook and YouTube needed to “get a grip” on the situation or risk undermining the crisis response.Knight added that the spread of 5G conspiracies raised alarms about how information about a future coronavirus vaccine would be disseminated.“If we were to get a vaccine for COVID-19, can we trust the social media companies to ensure that the right public health messages are put out about that vaccine?” he asked. “That could be a question of life and death for many people.”Facebook, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, said it was “starting to remove false claims that 5G technology causes the symptoms of or contraction of COVID-19.” YouTube said it would reduce recommendations of videos linking the coronavirus to 5G, while Twitter said it had taken action against misleading and harmful content about the illness.Wild claims about 5G are not new. The technology has an outsize political importance because it may provide countries with a competitive edge, with faster wireless speeds enabling more rapid development of driverless cars and other innovations.Internet trolls have seized on 5G and its political implications to sow fear, leading to protests in the United States and elsewhere against the technology in recent years. Russians have pushed claims that 5G signals were linked to brain cancer, infertility, autism, heart tumors and Alzheimer’s disease, all of which lacked scientific support."

BHOPAL: BJP vice-president Shivraj Singh Chouhan sparked controversy on Tuesday by alleging that 10 Janpath — the residence of Congress president Sonia Gandhi — is the “centre of violence and arson in the country”. Congress reacted by saying that Chouhan has been sidelined in BJP and is trying to be in news by making bizarre statements.“Congress has been involved in the biggest mob lynching. After the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1984, Congress pushed the entire country into violence by saying that ‘when a big tree falls, the earth shakes’. Questions are still being raised on Congress’s involvement in mob lynching. Now, the party is trying to push the country into a spiral of violence in the name of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and 10 Janpath is its centre,” Chouhan told mediapersons in Ludhiana.Chouhan, Madhya Pradesh’s CM for three terms, had triggered a major controversy in August last year when he called former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru a “criminal”. Chouhan had attacked Sonia Gandhi recently, asking why she did not say a word in Parliament during the debate on Citizenship Amendment Bill, but staged protests after it became a law.Justifying the implementation of CAA, Chouhan said that during Partition, Hindus, Sikhs and other minorities living in Pakistan had suffered severe torture. “Punjab suffered the most. Minorities in Pakistan are still suffering torture and people are not safe. They are living in fear,” said Chouhan.“The incident of stone pelting in Nankana Sahab is unfortunate. Congress is misleading the public to instigate violence. I want to ask Sonia ji, Punjab CM Amrinder Singh ji and MP CM Kamal Nath ji, what is wrong with CAA? What are they opposing? They should come clear on whether they do not want Hindus, Sikhs and other minorities, who have lost their lives in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, to be given Indian citizenship? They should make it clear if they want these Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists and Parsis to be sent back to Pakistan to die,” said Chouhan.The BJP leader questioned Congress’s “silence” on the attack on the Nankana Sahab gurdwara in Pakistan. “I want to ask why Sonia ji and Rahul ji took 15 hours to condemn the attack on Nankana Sahab? Leaders from Punjab, who talk loud, did not react on the attack. Is their friendship with Imran so strong that they do not think of their own country? This is Congress character and I condemn this,” said Chouhan.The former CM accused Rahul and Priyanka of creating misconception in the country on CAA. “But we will not let them succeed. Our leaders, including Prime Minister Modi and BJP national president Amit Shah and acting president JP Nadda are touring the country to make people aware of citizenship law,” he said.The Congress reacted strongly to Chouhan’s allegation. “Chouhan has turned irrelevant since he lost power. He has been sidelined in his own party and wants to remain in news through bizarre statements,” said Congress state media coordinator Narendra Singh Saluja. “Chouhan has been shunted out of active politics. He should clarify who was held with bombs and explosives. He should also identify who were charged with anti-national activities for being involved in explosions.”"

KOLKATA: Trouble again erupted at the “battle-ravaged” Dum Dum Central Correctional Home on Sunday, when some inmates reportedly tried to attack the women’s ward, took to arson and allegedly manhandled the guards, prompting police to resort to lathi-charge. A day earlier, inmates went on the rampage, set fire to jail property, fought pitched battles with police and attempted to scale over the walls, leading cops to open fire in which one prisoner was killed; at least 28 prisoners, jail employees and cops were injured on Saturday.Police on Sunday morning recovered two firearms and hammers in cells. “It seems to be a pre-planned attack or how could they have access to weapons on the premises,” said state correctional home minister Ujjwal Biswas . CID has started a probe into the incident.On Saturday, trouble broke out a little after 4pm, when the inmates were being sent back to their cells from the premises. Even as the new ADG (correctional services) Piyush Pandey tried to reason with them, the inmates reportedly launched a destruction frenzy, with one group setting a gas cylinder on fire. Before the situation could spiral out of control, police chased the group inside the cells. Another section of inmates reached the women’s ward, where the woman guards stopped them. But the male prisoners allegedly manhandled the women guards. Reinforcement of police and para-military forces ook nearly two hours to bring the situation under control.The reasons for the trouble were the same as that on Saturday: most prisoners and undertrials were upset with the fact that the prison authorities on Friday suspended their weekly interviews with their family members till March 31 to minimise the spread of the novel coronavirus . Another section of inmates demanded parole, as the government had proposed a 15-day “break” to around lifers, reportedly to decongest the correctional home.“We have identified those who have been creating trouble and provoking others. They apparently even threatened some male inmates, who had refused to join in the agitation on Saturday. To garner more support, the trouble-makers on Sunday tried to intimidate the female inmates into joining the agitation,” Biswas said.A CID team that reached the correctional home on Sunday is looking at the possibility of a lacunae in assessing and controlling a supposed emnity between the undertrials and convicts. The agency is collecting Saturday’s video footage circulated on social media."

NEW DELHI: Army chief Gen Bipin Rawat waded into a controversy on Thursday with his remarks that leadership is not about leading people — including students in universities and colleges — in the wrong direction, inviting criticism from the opposition that he had overstepped his limits as a serving officer.“Leaders are not those who lead people in inappropriate directions, as we are witnessing in a large number of university and college students, the way they are leading masses of crowds to carry out arson and violence in our cities and towns. This is not leadership,” Gen Rawat said.He is tipped to take over as the country’s first-ever chief of defence staff after completing his three-year tenure as Army chief on December 31. A senior officer at Army Headquarters later clarified that Gen Rawat had basically talked about “leadership qualities” in his speech.“There were no political statements. He did not mention either the CAA or the National Register of Citizens. He just expressed his worry about the law-and order situation, which impacts overall national security,” he added.But the reference — though Gen Rawat did not mention the Citizenship (Amendment) Act — was read in the context of the anti-CAA protests and violence in campuses like Jamia and AMU and saw CPM demanding that the general apologise for his “indiscretion” which had “adverse ramifications for the constitutional arrangement in the country”.Some serving and retired officers were also critical of Rawat’s comments. CPM’s Sitaram Yechury said, “The Army chief ’s statement underlines as to how the situation has degenerated under the Modi government.”He said the situation showed how an officer in uniform had brazenly breached the limits of his institutional role. Telangana Congress president and Lok Sabha MP Uttam Reddy said, “General Rawat, please don’t forget the code of conduct for serving military officers... A serving Army chief publicly trying to please political masters of the day on an extremely sensitive public issue by criticising opposition leaders! How unbecoming!” Yechury said that the Indian armed forces are “going the Pakistan way of politicising the military” and said that the Army chief ’s comments were an “obnoxious interference in matters of democratic struggles. Former BJP member Yashwant Sinha also took exception to Rawat’s utterances. “...Army Chief Bipin Rawat wading into the current political controversy is a new low. Must be nipped in the bud,” he said.Swaraj India member and rights activist Yogendra Yadav said, “I agree with him (Gen Rawat). Yes, leaders should lead (people) in the appropriate direction. I am absolutely sure he has the PM of this country in mind when talking about that.”Serving and retired officers, who stressed that the armed forces are justifiably proud of their apolitical and secular ethos, maintained that Gen Rawat had “crossed the line yet again” by taking a public stand against the ongoing anti-CAA protests.Eastern Army Command chief Lt Gen Anil Chauhan earlier this month had also observed that the NDA government “was keen on taking hard decisions pending for a long time” — a statement that had raised eyebrows for its political overtones.Former Navy chief Admiral L Ramdas (retd) said Gen Rawat’s remarks were clearly “wrong”, stressing that armed forces personnel must follow the decades-old principle of “serving the country and not any political force”.In Video: Leaders are not those who lead people in inappropriate directions: Bipin Rawat"

NEW DELHI: A wide swathe of north-east Delhi — from Jafrabad to Chand Bagh and Karawal Nagar — was wracked by communal riots and incidents of rampant vandalism on Monday as anti- and pro-CAA groups clashed for over seven hours.It left fires burning in the streets — which were littered with stones, bricks and glass — with smoke scarring the landscape. Stone-pelting, firing and arson left one policeman and four others dead while over 60 were injured. These include two dozen cops, including a DCP, passersby and rioters.When night fell, incidents were still being reported with the situation very volatile. Prohibitory orders under Section 144 of CrPC have been imposed in the violence-affected areas. Curfew could be imposed any time if the situation deteriorated.Security personnel conducted flag marches in the evening and additional forces, including the CRPF, have been deployed.The deceased cop was identified as head constable Ratan Lal. DCP (Shahdara) Amit Sharma, currently in the ICU, is reported to be critical with severe head injuries and clots and bruises all over his body. He was dragged out of his official vehicle at Chand Bagh and it was set on fire.It is unclear whether the five died of gunshot injuries or blunt force trauma. An official confirmation on the cause of death will be made only after postmortem is conducted on Tuesday. The head constable was killed in Gokulpuri while the others were brought to GTB Hospital from undisclosed places and declared dead on arrival.ACP (Gokulpuri) Anuj Kumar, two CRPF personnel and three firemen were also injured. Many journalists were manhandled. Delhi Police is learnt to have filed multiple FIRs in connection with the violence. It has also filed four FIRs regarding Sunday’s violence in the same area.The area had witnessed protests and sporadic clashes on Sunday and it’s a mystery how police failed to anticipate and contain the situation.Violence was reported from Jafrabad, Chand Bagh, Maujpur Bhajanpura , Kardampuri, Gokulpuri, Khajuri and Karawal Nagar as frenzied mobs went on the rampage torching vehicles, shops and a petrol pump and attacking anyone who came in their way or whom they suspected to be of the other religion.Full-fledged stone-pelting started between the anti- and pro-CAA groups around 10.30am in several areas in and around Jafrabad. The violence soon escalated, taking a communal turn. The mobs kept on growing in strength, and in no time, the two sides were throwing stones at each other from either side of the Yamuna canal, which runs parallel to the Metro tracks.In Maujpur, the protesters not only threw stones but also torched three vehicles and shops that had their shutters down. At least one house was set on fire and plumes of smoke were seen rising from the balcony. The protestors were also seen assaulting a man after striking him down. They were shouting slogans and did not let him go even though he was bleeding.The violence spiralled further around 1pm when rioters set fire to a petrol pump in Bhajanpura. Two school buses were also torched on the Bhajanpura-Yamuna Vihar border. All major roads were littered with bricks, stones and glass shards. At Bhajanpura Chowk, a fire tender was damaged by the protesters after it responded to an emergency call from the area.The role of the police has come under scrutiny as they have been accused of not acting promptly in the morning and being mute spectators to the violence at many places through the day. The cops were seen trying to chase away the rioters by throwing back their stones and firing tear gas shells but soon came face-to-face at several spots in the afternoon. There, they wielded lathis but it was of little use. At one point, an armed man — later identified as one Mohammed Shahrukh — was caught on camera confronting a lone cop. He opened multiple rounds of fire with a crowd of around a hundred people egging him on from a distance. He even pointed the gun at the cop’s face point-blank. Later in the evening, he was detained by the cops.Vehicular traffic remained restricted on road number 59, which leads to Bhajanpura on one side and Ghaziabad via the Gokulpuri flyover on the other, causing inconvenience to commuters and locals, including students. Many students were seen trying to nervously make their way back to home, asking the police for safe passage.Worried residents called up their relatives in different parts of the capital but few could reach them. Many were seen standing ahead of Jafrabad metro station towards Seelampur and asking people coming from the riot-hit zone if they were alright. “I had come to take my sister and her family but she told me people are pelting stones outside the house. I cannot reach her and I cannot leave her too,” said a 40-year old man.In one of the bylanes, a woman looked visibly worried as she waited for her grand daughter to return home. “I did not send the younger one to school but the elder one had to go. I regret sending her now. My heart is pounding with each passing minute,” she said. “My husband came here to collect some payment and the next call I got from him was that he was injured in the stone pelting,” said another woman. “Why are innocent people being attacked, we are not on any side,” said the woman."

KOCHI: The idol at Sabarimala Temple was broken during an arson in 1950, according to an enquiry report submitted by then deputy inspector general of police (special branch, CID) K Kesava Menon.First noticed by a priest on June 14, 1950, the arson was reported to police two days later by the commissioner and the president of Travancore Devaswom Board. The temple was last closed on May 20. The priest, his subordinates and some worshippers had left the place, with nobody staying back.When Kollam district superintendent of police visited the place, he had noticed that, “The idol was found broken; the head, left hand palm and fingers separated. There were cut marks on the face of the idol as well as on the forehead.”The enquiry had found out that the fire was not an accident. There were 15 cut marks of violence on the door leading to the sreekovil (sanctum sanctorum), indicating forcible entry, the report said. Police had found traces of brass on the sharp edge of an axe found from the spot. Theft attempt was ruled out as silver, gold and utensils were not taken away.Apart from this, there were evidences of somebody forcibly entering store room and kitchen quarters and throwing out the vessels. Police also found a kerosene lantern in the sreekovil.Menon said in his report that the arson could have happened on any of the nights of May 21 or 22, 1950. According to the official report, the acts of paili (forest watcher), whose duty was to detect unlicensed hunting in the forests, were suspicious. He had been part of a hunting team in the area near the temple during those days. The report also hinted at two landowning and politically powerful families of Kanjirappilly and adjoining areas who could have acted through the paili. The report, supposed to be tabled in the assembly, was never released officially. There was no further action on the findings."

LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday alleged that the Opposition is ""giving money"" for arson and ""sponsoring"" anti-CAA protests to mislead people.He said the previous governments didn't have the courage to grant citizenship to persecuted religious minorities from neighbouring countries and now the opposition parties are creating confusion about the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).""The Opposition is giving money for arson and sponsoring sit-ins and agitations against the CAA to mislead people. But the people have stood behind Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji and against those who speak the language of our enemies,"" Adityanath said at a rally here in support of the CAA, which was also addressed by Union home minister Amit Shah.Using a term which describes the disrobing of Mahabharata's Draupadi, the chief minister said, ""The Opposition is doing 'cheerharan' of the country and we can't sit silently in this situation.""He also lauded the Modi government for enacting the CAA.""I appreciate the Centre for this move. The previous governments did not have courage to take it up. Now Congress, BSP and SP are creating confusion among the people on the CAA and it's our responsibility to reach out to the people with correct information,"" he added.Issues on which work should have been started after 1947 were taken up by the BJP after it got an absolute majority, Adityanath said.""In the past six months, you (people) may have witnessed many changes. People in the country were disheartened and demoralised that these issues (CAA, Article 370, etc) might not be resolved. But as our election slogan says, 'Modi hai to mumkin hai' (It is possible if Modi is there), all the issues were resolved,"" he said.After Independence, Congress governments had a chance to work on issues of terrorism, separatism and discrimination but they didn't, the chief minister said, adding that the BJP is dealing with them strictly.""The Congress did not do anything while other opposition parties, whenever they got a chance, only played politics on crucial issues,"" he said.""In Ayodhya, a 'kalank' (blot) of 500 years ended, (Article) 370 was abolished, we brought a law on triple 'talaq' and CAA,"" he added.According to the CAA, members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan till December 31, 2014, to escape religious persecution there will not be treated as illegal immigrants but given Indian citizenship.It does not include Muslims.Those opposing the CAA contend that it discriminates on the basis of religion and violates the Constitution. They also allege that the CAA along with the National Register of Citizens is intended to target the Muslim community in India.However, the central government has dismissed the allegations, maintaining that the law is intended to give citizenship to the persecuted people from the three neighbouring countries and not to take away anyone's citizenship."

NAGPUR: A day ahead of Union home minister Amit Shah ’s visit to the district on Friday to campaign for sitting BJP MLA Ambrishrao Atram, who is contesting from Aheri constituency, Maoists carried out a blast targeting security forces in South Gadchiroli. In another incident, the outlaws also torched three vehicles.Though there was no confirmation of Maoist pamphlets being found near the places of arson and blast, these incidents are seemingly aimed at disrupting assembly elections, scheduled for October 21. Maoists are known to boycott polls, but no posters or banners have been found in the district from the Reds in view of the forthcoming election yet.It’s learnt that some armed Maoists had set three road construction vehicles, including a JCB machine, on fire near Jijawandi village in Etapalli in the wee hours of Wednesday. Though police are yet to confirm the incident, sources from Etapalli stated that the rebels had targeted the vehicles parked at a road construction site. The rebels used fuel from the targeted vehicles to torch them.In yet another incident, Maoists triggered a blast targeting security forces which were engaged in area domination exercise. It’s learnt that a combined squad of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Quick Response Team (QRT) of Hedri and personnel of armed out post of Gatta-Jambia was patrolling when some suspects were spotted. As the security forces started cordoning off the area, a powerful blast was triggered by the suspects. The forces fired a few rounds, but the outlaws managed to sneak away.SP Shailesh Balkawade said there was prior information about an IED being planted and security personnel were moving to the spot."

KANPUR: Police have intensified vigil at hair salons across Kanpur after intelligence inputs that those accused of arson during protests against CAA were going for a complete makeover to evade identification and arrest.This follows release of posters with photographs by the district administration to track and auction properties of those involved in violence to pay for damages. Kanpur police have put up posters and released videos of nearly 76 people allegedly involved in violence during last week’s protests. Three persons were killed and 13, including three policemen injured in violence.As soon as police released photographs and videos of the suspects, they received inputs about rising footfalls at salons dotting Beconganj, Chamanganj, Nai Sadak and Latouche Road areas. “We roped in police personnel in ‘civvies’ to track down trouble makers. We are approaching salon owners and giving them posters of accused. We are also scanning CCTV cameras installed at salon shops and nearby areas,” said a senior police official.Salon owners admitted to police that post-CAA violence, they were getting a flood of first-time customers for a makeover. “Despite harsh winters, many with thick beard were asking for a clean-shave look and those with long hair were seeking a bald look,” said Pawan (name changed), a hair-cutting salon worker."

AGRA: Two days after Saimra village under Khandauli police jurisdiction in Agra witnessed arson and stone-pelting over elopement of an inter-faith couple, an FIR was lodged against 250 unknown men on Thursday.Speaking to TOI, superintendent of police (west) Ravi Kumar said, “We have booked these men under IPC sections 147 (riot), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house, etc) and 7 CLA Act.

We have assured local residents and victims of every possible help,” he added. Meanwhile, a few locals and victims claimed that police have not included names of those accused whom they identified and gave a written complaint against.Badar, whose cycle shop was set ablaze, said, “We gave 18 names to the police but none of those names have been included in the FIR. Police is lenient towards the accused men. Total 15 shops were set on fire. We want justice.”“On Thursday, police team and the accused came to meet us. One of the accused openly accepted his role in arson, but no action was taken,” alleged Badar. A team of village lekhpal visited Saimra and conducted assessment of the losses incurred by the accused men.Nearly a dozen shops were set ablaze and heavy stone-pelting was reported in a remote village of Agra district, after a man and a minor girl from two different communities allegedly eloped.The 15-year-old girl, who is a student of class IX, was living at her maternal grandfather’s house in Saimra village of Khandauli police jurisdiction, while the boy, who the police claims to be 18-years old, lived stone’s throw away. He is claimed to be class XII student.The elder brother of the accused boy said, “He left with the 15-year-old girl for Delhi on Tuesday morning. Both of them were later tracked down and brought to Agra with the help of distant relatives. My brother is a class 11 student. He has made a mistake but the entire community should not be punished for his deeds. We are poor and afraid of being attacked again.”"

SHILLONG: An indefinite curfew was clamped in the Meghalaya capital of Shillong from 10pm on Thursday even as mobile internet and messaging were blocked for 48 hours after protesters against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill ransacked shops and set ablaze vehicles at Police Bazar, the city's commercial district.Around 20 to 30 youths, many of them wielding rods, went on the rampage in the heart of Police Bazar, targeting shops, cars, traders and shoppers. They set fire to several vehicles, eyewitnesses said.As news of the arson spread, markets across the East Khasi Hills, of which Shillong is a part, quickly downed shutters. Heavy midday traffic choked the roads as people who had stepped out, including office workers, rushed home early.""Information is received that there is a serious deterioration of law and order, with reports of arson and vandalism and destruction of property and vehicles. These activites are likely to continue, causing serious breach of peace and tranquillity, and could lead to loss of life and property,"" deputy commissioner M War Nongbri said in the curfew order.According to PTI, some cabinet ministers who were to accompany CM Conrad K Sangma to Delhi for a meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday night couldn't make it to Guwahati airport because of the unrest in neighbouring Assam Sangma, however, managed to reach the airport in time for his flight. The ministers will leave for Delhi on Friday by helicopter from Shillong, the agency quoted a source in the CM's office as saying.Sangma's National People’s Party (NPP), an NDA ally, had voted in favour of the CAB in the Lok Sabha, with party MP Agatha Sangma mentioning that the 6th Schedule of the Constitution would ""insulate"" 97 per cent of Meghalaya from the bill. The state government aims to prevail on Shah to exempt the whole of Meghalaya from its purview.Until Thursday afternoon, Shillong and the rest of the state had been calm even as Guwahati, less than 100km away, erupted. There were two anti-CAB processions in Shillong during the day, one by Congress activists in the afternoon and another from the Mothphran neighbourhood in the evening, Both protests were heavily policed and no untoward incident took place, officials said."

Bokaro: The recent spurt in Maoist activities in Giridih is emerging as a cause of concern for police ahead of parliamentary polls.In a fresh incident, Maoists on Wednesday night targeted a road construction company site and torched mixer machine and other equipment at Harkatwau of Bandh panchayat under Pirtaad police station in Giridih.Sources said that about a dozen armed Maoists reached the spot and asked daily wage earners staying there to vacate the place. Thereafter, they torched the machines that belonged to Ganesh Yadav Construction Company, which is engaged in building a road from Chirki to Rajganj. They also fired several rounds in the air.The police visited the site only on Thursday morning. Girdih SP S K Jha said that they have launched a search operation in the area.He added, “The motive of Maoists might be to disturb Lok Sabha polls. But we are vigilant and will give them a befitting reply.”This is the fourth such incident in less than a week. On Sunday night, Maoists shot dead a villager in Kanadi after branding him a police informer. On Monday, one CRPF jawan got martyred and three Maoists were killed in an encounter under Bhelwaghati police station of Giridih. On Wednesday, the body of a student and AAP supporter was recovered from Bandh, the incident is suspected to be a handiwork of left-wing extremists."

GUWAHATI: An office of the All Assam Students' Union (Aasu) in Nalbari district was damaged in a suspected arson attack on Monday night that the organisation claimed was the handiwork of those trying to disrupt the publication of the state's final National Register of Citizens (NRC) on August 31.The incident in the Lower Assam town of Tihu occurred within hours of the Union home ministry directing the state government to declare a state of high alert in the run-up to the scheduled publication of the citizenship rolls.“The attack on our office is part of a conspiracy to cause disruption and uncertainty ahead of the publication of the final NRC. Aasu appeals to everyone to keep calm. We are hopeful that the state will get an error-free NRC on August 31,” Aasu president Dipanka Kumar Nath and general secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi said in a joint statement on Tuesday.Outfits aligned with the Sangh Parivar have upped the tempo of their campaign to stall the publication of the final NRC till a comprehensive ""re-verification"" of all citizenship applications is carried out. Their apprehensions stem from unconfirmed reports about the exclusion of a large number of Hindus from the final rolls.In 2017, activists of the Nikhil Bharat Bangali Udbastu Samannay Samiti had ransacked an Aasu office at Silapathar in Upper Assam’s Dhemaji district . The organisation has been demanding citizenship for Hindu migrants who arrived from Bangladesh , pitting it against Aasu, which treats any post-1971 migrant as a foreigner.“If they (protesters) have something to say about the NRC, they should have approached the Supreme Court. At this stage, demanding that the publication of NRC be postponed smacks of vested interest and an attempt to derail the entire process,” the Aasu general secretary said.The Gauhati high court on Tuesday announced the appointment of 221 retired officials to 200 additional foreigners' tribunals. These tribunals are being set up in anticipation of a rush of re-verification claims after the final updated NRC is published 10 days from now.Anyone who does not make it to the final NRC will immediately be referred to a foreigners' tribunal by the police. Assam has 100 such tribunals, set up in phases since 2005. The state government has set itself a target of forming 1,000 tribunals, of which 200 are ready to start functioning next month, commissioner and secretary (home and political) Ashutosh Agnihotri said."

SRINAGAR: In a partial shutdown, shops remained closed and public transport stayed off roads in Srinagar and south Kashmir on Thursday following previous night’s arson and appearance of threatening posters in the city’s downtown areas. On Wednesday night, miscreants had set on fire four shops, as many street carts and a cab.Srinagar district magistrate Shahid Iqbal Choudhary on Thursday issued a strict warning to miscreants, who were threatening residents of the district. The DM urged people to immediately report instances of intimidation at local police stations, assuring them that action would follow immediately and that the miscreants would be dealt with sternly.Police said cases had been registered in all the incidents of fire and that investigation was on. Those involved in burning of these properties would be arrested soon, police said, adding that these incidents showed the ‘frustration’ of the people who wanted to prolong the shutdown in Kashmir.Shops and public transport, however, plied normally in north Kashmir on Thursday, reports said.All shops, business establishments and public transport, including cabs, had started functioning normally since November 16 after almost 100 days of shutdown starting August 5 when Parliament took the decision to nullify Article 370 and reorganize the state of J&K into two Union Territories. However, the problem resurfaced after Union home minister Amit Shah announced in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday that the situation in Kashmir had become normal.Soon after Shah’s Parliament remark, miscreants pasted posters at several places in the city, threatening people to observe shutdown in the Valley. Not just that, they also set on fire shops, carts and a cab, sources said.Public transport mostly stayed off city roads and some south Kashmir areas in reaction to the burning down of a Tavera vehicle (cab) in Nawa Kadal area of downtown Srinagar on Wednesday night.Similarly, shops and other business establishments in many areas of south Kashmir and Srinagar district, including commercial hub Lal Chowk , remained closed on Thursday following the burning down of shops and appearance of threating posters the previous night.Reports said that four shops were gutted in a fire incident in Bohri Kadal area of Srinagar. “The incident took place on Wednesday evening around 7pm,” an official source said, adding that the cause of the blaze was being ascertained.The source further said that four carts of street vendors were set on fire in Soura area of Srinagar around 10.30pm on Wednesday.Meanwhile, police in Awantipora arrested an associate of a terrorist for his involvement in threatening and intimidating locals in Tral area. He has been identified as Asif Ahmad Bhat, a resident of Larow Jageer, Tral."

JAIPUR: For past 20 days, the dingy alleys in the Walled City areas had been in the grip of a simmering tension that had reached a boiling point when two communities clashed on Monday night.Police, however, failed to anticipate despite intelligence inputs and two incidents that should have ideally served as a warning of what was to follow.On July 24, a frenzied crowed had blocked the highway and targeted vehicles passing through the road. “That night there was a heavy downpour due to which the mob was forced to a make a hasty retreat. One bus was vandalised, but the situation was control. If police had made adequate arrangements, things would not have not gone out of control,” said Deen Dayal Gupta, a local resident. The final warning shots were fired when a few Kanwarias were injured in a clash with locals near Char Darwaja area under Ramganj police station on Sunday night. Police did not pay heed to the incident and marked it off as a “minor tussle.” Sunday’s incident, however, had set-off a series of events that finally translated on Monday evening when after Eid payers two communities came at loggerheads again.The police was caught off guard as by Monday evening the japta (deployment) had begun to retreat. The sources in the intelligence wing of the police said all four police zones of Jaipur police commissionerate were put on a high alert several days ago.“The intelligence inputs had specified police station areas. Monday was the last of shravan somvars which coincided with Eid. The police should have been extra vigil. We had also told the police in advance to remain alert following Union government’s decision to revoke Jammu and Kashmir’s special status,” an official told TOI.A senior police officer said deployment indeed was not adequate. He said police were also probing if the violence waspre-planned."

KOLKATA: A fire reported inside an empty ground floor room of the four-storey Linton Hostel has led its inhabitants — junior doctors and MBBS students of Chittaranjan National Medical College and Hospital (CNMCH) — to allege that miscreants had deliberately set their hostel on fire in the wee hours of Thursday.Though the inhabitants and locals managed to control the fire, the cops at Beniapukur said they are not entirely ruling out the possibility of the fire starting outside. “We are calling forensic experts to ascertain how it originated,” said DC (southeast) Ajoy Prasad. The residents of the hostel located on Linton Road opposite CNMCH alleged that petrol bombs were hurled at them in order to “teach them a lesson” as they had decided to stand in solidarity with the junior doctors of NRS Hospital.According to police, the fire was reported around 1.25am. “The fire broke out in an empty room at the ground floor of the (G+3) building. Locals extinguished the fire around 1.35am even as two fire tenders attended to the fire spot. No report of injury or entrapment has been reported. Cops ensured the situation remained peaceful,” said an officer in a terse statement from Lalbazar. Beniapukur police have launched a probe.Nilotpal Nandi, the former president of CNMCH students’ union, claimed the cops were misleading since at least three rooms were affected. “Neither were they empty nor was the fire doused without any damages,” he said. “The residents of A9 (the room that’s now completely burnt) are medical students, who haven’t yet completed MBBS. All their belongings, including marksheets, are all gone. Their books are all burnt to ashes. The money that their parents sent were also lost. Only the smell of kerosene and smoke now fills the room,” Nandi wrote on his Facebook page, a post that went viral.Nandi added that he has CCTV footages (that he has shared) of strangers roaming inside the hostel compound with “sticks and stumps and are repeatedly asking about the whereabouts of doctors”. “This is intimidating to say the least. But, this would not have been possible if the administration was really serious about our security,” said Soumava Chatterjee, an intern and a hostel resident. “We are being threatened to change our stance,” said Chatterjee."

KOLKATA: A group of prominent personalities of West Bengal , including film director Aparna Sen , on Friday expressed concern over the violence and arson that took place during and after the visit of Union minister Babul Supriyo to Jadavpur University campus on Thursday.In a statement here, 15 personalities said there is cause to worry over the behaviour of the minister with the vice-chancellor of the university and the conduct of Supriyo's security personnel with the students.""The protesting students should also have behaved in a restrained manner keeping in mind the restive atmosphere in the entire country.... Students should not be treated as hardened criminals in a healthy environment,"" they said.Urging the state government to conduct a probe into the incident and punish the guilty, they called upon politicians not to do anything which will disturb the academic atmosphere of the university campus and tackle any emerging situation in a democratic way and not by violent means.Supriyo, a singer-turned BJP leader, was shown black flags and heckled by a section of Jadavpur University students, who also stopped him from leaving the campus. Supriyo was in the university to attend an event organised by the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP).The personalities under the banner of 'Citizenspeak India' said they are also stunned and scared over the incident of ""setting some objects on fire"" in the chain of events following the protest.Apart from Aparna Sen, the signatories included thespian Kaushik Sen, actor Riddhi Sen, singer Rupam Islam, social activist-columnist Bolan Gangopadhyay and others."

KOCHI: Rahul Raj , 26, a resident of Ambattukavu in Aluva, was arrested by North police on Tuesday on charges of arson. Police said that the youth set on fire the property of a paying guest owner after he suspected that owner might have revealed the truth about his wife’s previous marriages, a fact he concealed from his friends.Police said that the house did not sustain much damage but three vehicles parked on the porch –a scooter, bike and car – were gutted in the fire. The incident happened on December 4 near PJ Antony Ground around 11 pm. Based on CCTV footage obtained from the area, police launched an investigation and zeroed in on Raj, who confessed everything.Police said that the accused committed the crime out of enmity. He felt that house owner, Sai Prasad, was responsible for his personal issues that allegedly created problems in his family. “His wife, Ann Mariya (32), was a paying guest at Prasad’s house for a few months in 2017 before their marriage. Within a few weeks she vacated the place following issues with Prasad and his family. In June 2018, she married Rahul, her third husband. She had married in 2012 and 2015 and had obtained divorce both times. Raj had not revealed this to his friends and relatives,” said the police.Problems started a month ago after Raj’s family and friends found that Mariya had married before. Some pictures of her second marriage turned up on Facebook recently. This created trouble in his family and his friends started taunting him. “The accused doubted that it was Prasad and his family members who posted the photos on Facebook. He reached the house around 10.50pm on December 4 and set the vehicles on fire after pouring petrol on them. The blaze was doused by the fire and rescue team after three-hour battle,” said SI Anaz V D, who investigated the case."

KOLKATA: Incidents of violence and arson were reported from various parts of West Bengal with buses, a police vehicle and government properties being vandalised by strikers who tried to enforce the 24-hour bandh on Wednesday.Protesters blocked a major road in Sujapur area of Malda district, set tyres on fire, ransacked government buses and torched several vehicles, including a police van. When police tried to control the situation, they hurled stones and crude bombs.The police then baton-charged the mob, lobbed teargas shells and fired rubber bullets, officials said.In various parts of the state, railway tracks and roads were blocked, affecting normal life.The protesters burnt tyres and blocked roads in various parts of the East Burdwan district, besides staging sit-in on railway tracks, affecting train services in the sector.In East Midnapore district, stones were hurled at buses, following which the protesters clashed with the police, leading to several arrests, the officials said.Several buses were also vandalised in Cooch Behar districts by the protesters.The bandh supporters tried to break past barricades in Kolkata's Central Avenue area, prompting police to use force. Several strikers were held, they said.In Dum Dum and Lake Town, clashes broke out between Left supporters, who took out rallies in support of the strike, and TMC supporters who were opposing it. A huge police contingent was rushed to the spot to control the situation, the police said.The strikers also blocked railway tracks at Jadavpur, disrupting services in the important section and shut down vehicular movement on nearby roads, following which police resorted to baton charge. CPI(M) legislature party leader Sujan Chakraborty was detained for instigating violence, the officials said.Members of Jadavpur University students' union also also joined the strikers and staged demonstration near their campus.Country-made bombs were found on several roads in Barasat area of the North 24 Parganas district. Crude bombs were also found on railway tracks at some places in the district, they said.The strikers also took out rallies in the industrial belt of the district, including Barrackpore and Sodepur, and blocked roads and railway tracks.Daily commuters and office-goers across the state had a harrowing time as the number of vehicles plying on the roads was much less than other days.In Kolkata, government buses were plying normally but the number of private buses was less. Metro services were normal in the city and auto-rickshaws and taxis were also seen on the roads.Heavy police deployment was seen in several areas, including in Tollygunge, Behala, Esplanade and Shyambazar.Slamming the Left and the Congress for trying to enforce the bandh, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said that those who do not have any political existence in the state are trying to ruin its economy by pursuing ""cheap politics"" of strikes.She said police will take action as per law against the protesters.Till noon, around 55 people were arrested from different parts of the city for allegedly trying to block vehicles, stall government buses or forcibly stop shopkeepers from opening their establishments, a senior officer of the Kolkata Police said.Flight services were normal at Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport but train services were partially affected in some sectors of the Sealdah, Howrah and Kharagpur sections due to obstruction by protesters.The Trinamool Congress also took out rallies opposing the strike at some places in north Bengal and urged people to maintain normalcy.Branches and ATMs of most of the banks in the state remained closed as employees stayed away. Contractual workers also joined the stir.According to the All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA), some 28 lakh cheques worth over Rs 21,000 crore could not be sent for clearing.Staff of the Reserve Bank of India also joined the strike.The All India Reserve Bank Employees Association (AIRBEA) general secretary Samir Ghosh said strike was successful.Majority of the jute mills in the state also remained shut.Life at Bengal's IT hub Sector V was near normal, although there was partial impact in attendance in the early hours due to disruptions in transport, NASSCOM sources said.The state government offices recorded around 95 attendance, a senior official claimed.The government has announced that no casual leave for absence, either in the first-half of the day or in the second-half or for the whole day, nor any other leave shall be granted to any employee during the strike.The strike has been called by trade unions INTUC, AITUC, HMS, CITU, AIUTUC, TUCC, SEWA, AICCTU, LPF, UTUC, along with various sectoral independent federations and associations.Their demands include a minimum pension of Rs 6,000 for everyone, minimum support price (MSP) for farmers, adequate supply of ration to people, she said, adding that the demands concern common man's issues besides worker-centric areas.In Video: Protesters block railway tracks in WB after trade unions call for ‘bharat bandh’"

NEW DELHI: Nearly 35 years after their alleged involvement in violence and arson during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, the Supreme Court on Tuesday reversed concurrent judgments of the trial court and Delhi high court and acquitted seven persons who were sentenced to five years in jail.Appearing for the convicts, senior advocate R Basant and advocate V Raghunath told a bench of CJI Ranjan Gogoi and Justices Deepak Gupta and Sanjiv Khanna that they were picked up randomly by police for violating curfew imposed after the rioting and that there was no evidence to link them to rioting or arson.The trial court in 1996 had convicted 88 people on these charges and the Delhi HC had in November last year upheld their conviction and sentence while asking them to surrender and undergo rigorous imprisonment. The SC on Tuesday took up appeals of seven of the 88 convicts.Referring to the prosecution evidence, the CJI-led bench said it unhesitatingly took the view that the prosecution witnesses have neither identified the accused nor placed any evidence against them before the court. “It is a classic case of no evidence against the accused,” the bench said and ordered their acquittal from the case.Appearing for the prosecution, additional solicitor general Pinky Anand suggested that in a case involving many accused, the prosecution should be permitted to apply ‘mechanical test’ to produce evidence against key persons to rope in others who were accompanying them. But, the SC said it did not see how the mechanical test would help the prosecution when it was a case of ‘no evidence at all’. “The offence alleged against the accused is rioting. But without any evidence and their identification by the witnesses, they cannot be convicted,” it said."

CHENNAI: Five suspects were arrested on Thursday for arson and vandalism at Nallur toll plaza on Wednesday. Search is on for those who stole cash from the plaza counters during the clash. Police plan to comb the neighbouring villages to narrow down the suspects.Truck and van drivers vandalized the toll plaza in the city’s northern suburbs after the staff roughed up some of them for questioning the hike in rates for monthly passes. Chaos reigned at the Nallur toll plaza in Thiruvallur bringing traffic to a standstill along the Chennai-Kolkata highway for more than an hour. Police registered two separate cases and arrested five people from both sides, who were later remanded in Puzhal prison.Meanwhile, the toll plaza manager lodged a fresh complaint at Sholavaram police station demanding legal action against the suspects who stole cash from the collection booths. The officials have also given CCTV camera footage of some people attacking and damaging the computers at the toll booth and stealing cash from the counters.The toll plaza, established in 2009 by the NHAI, is maintained by a private concessionaire. Until last financial year, the monthly pass cost Rs 150 and Rs 300 for local traffic within 10km and 10-20km radius from the plaza. Toll rates were revised on April 1. The manifold increase in rate of monthly passes resulted in protests by local truck and van drivers during the second week of April."

Bhubaneswar: Miscreants allegedly torched two SUVs and two bikes parked in the garage of the official residence of BJD's Talcher MLA, Braja Kishore Pradhan, at MLA Colony here early on Monday.Pradhan was not present in his quarters - a stone's throw from the assembly - when the incident occurred at 2 am, but two of his supporters were asleep inside the house.The three-time MLA could not be contacted for comment.Police and fire service personnel have ruled out the possibility of an accidental fire. "" Prima facie, we suspect it to be a case of mischief. Our investigation is in progress. We will find those behind the crime,"" additional commissioner of police Sanjay Singh said after visiting the MLA's quarters.Police are likely to question a woman who had earlier claimed that Pradhan had married her - something the MLA has denied - and had ransacked his quarters in May 2017. Though she had not been arrested then, Kharavel Nagar Police had registered a case against her.Soumya Ranjan Nayak, who was asleep on the first floor of the house, said he heard an explosion late in the night. ""I found smoke billowing out and rushed to the ground floor. But the door was locked from outside. I called the fire brigade and police and escaped the house by scaling the rear boundary wall,"" Nayak said. Pradhan's neighbours expressed shock at the incident, which comes in the backdrop of a spate of snatchings and robberies in the city that have left police embarrassed. ""We did not realize what happened at night. Police should intensify patrolling in the colony and arrest the culprits,"" said Chhendipada MLA, Sushant Kumar Behera.The MLA Colony, with more than 110 quarters, does not have police or private security guards. ""If goons can strike at an MLA's house, how can the common people remain safe?"" wondered another legislator."

DUMKA ( JHARKHAND ): Accusing the Congress and its allies of fuelling violence over the amended Citizenship Act , Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said the opposition's actions prove that the decision to pass the bill was ""1,000 per cent correct"", and those indulging in arson ""can be identified by their clothes"".""The Congress and its allies are stoking fire over the Citizenship Act, but people of northeast have rejected violence,"" he said during an election rally here.""The country is watching; people's faith has been cemented in Modi after the Bill was cleared by Parliament. Their (Opposition) actions reflect that the decision to pass Citizenship (Amendment) Bill in Parliament is 1,000 per cent correct,"" the prime minister said.Protests have been raging against the law in northeast and West Bengal, where several railway stations, trains and buses were set afire by mobs over the last two days.""People who are setting fire (to property) can be seen on TV... They can be identified by the clothes they are wearing,"" he said without elaborating.Condemning the overseas protests held by Congress, he said, ""For the first time, the Congress did what Pakistanis has been doing for long.""A large number of people had gathered outside the Indian High Commission in London on Saturday to protest the amended Act and what they branded as Modi government's ""failures"".""You will be surprised at the events that had unfolded near the Indian High Commission in London after the verdict was announced on Ram Janmabhoomi and the abrogation of Article 370. People from Pakistan, those settled in London, had staged demonstrations outside our embassy,"" he said.""Did any Indian stage demonstration near the Embassy? If there is any issue, a person goes to the Embassy, meets the officials, who then send the documents to the central government,"" Modi explained.Efforts were being made to tarnish the country's image, he alleged.Protests have been raging across the entire northeast region and West Bengal over the amended Citizenship Act, as people fear that it might exacerbate the problem of illegal immigration.Listing the achievements of the BJP governments at the Centre and Jharkhand, the prime minister said, ""I am your sevak (servant). I have come here to give an account of the development work done by our party in the state.""He claimed that leaders of the opposition parties have only built palaces for themselves without paying any attention to the problems faced by common people.The Congress and the JMM have no roadmap or agenda for developing Jharkhand, Modi insisted.Referring to the sacrifice made by tribal freedom fighters for the country, he sought to know whether the British would have left India, had Birsa Munda, Sido-Kano, Chand- Bhairav and Phulo-Jano cared about personal gains.""These great tribal martyrs rose above their personal interest to serve the society and the country,"" Modi said, adding that the BJP has derived its culture from them.He thanked Vice President Venkaiah Naidu for encouraging MPs to use local languages, including Santhali, in Parliament, while also ensuring their English and Hindi translations were available on headphones.""Santhal Pargana has a rich language and culture. The government will promote spiritual tourism in the Santhal Pargana, where many temples of Lord Shiva and other temples are situated. I thank vice president Venkaiah Naidu ji for arranging translation of Santhali language in the Rajya Sabha,"" Modi added."

Daltonganj: Unidentified miscreants set ablaze three earth-movers and mining equipment at Dantuta stone quarry , barely 8km from Chhaterpur police station at Cheeru panchayat late on Wednesday. Police has ruled out the involvement of Maoists in the incident. Palamu SP Indrajeet Mahatha said locals living in the vicinity have been opposing the quarry citing risks to their lives were involved in the arson . Barely 150 meters from the mine are villages whose residents claimed blasts at the quarry shake their houses and put their families at risk.“No hand-written leaflets were found at the site. The arsonists did not raise slogans swearing allegiance to naxal outfits,” Mahatha said, quoting Chhaterpur sub-divisional police officer Shambhu K Singh.Villagers sat on a dharna on Palamu collectorate premise a few months ago claiming quarry operations will contaminate water sources, pollute the area and affect commute to villages in its proximity. Soon after, the then Chhaterpur SDO Chhaterpur B Thakur and district mines officer M Toppo inspected the site but a solution to the villagers’ problems were not found.Sources said the arson is a case of direct conflict of interest of villagers with the quarry owner identified as Anjani Singh. Residents of two villages Cheeru and Pattkhaiyee were most vocal against this mine.Mahatha added: “This quarry has seen a few ugly scenes in the past where unidentified people had thrashed the staff here to make them run away from here.” Police was also informed that quarry workers had fired bullets in the air recently to scare the villagers."

LUCKNOW: The UP government on Friday declined prosecution sanction sought by the CB-CID for two police officers in connection with arson in the house of Rita Bahuguna Joshi in 2009. Presently a BJP MP from Allahabad, Joshi was UP Congress Committee chief then.The officers involved are then-SSP Lucknow Prem Prakash who is now posted as ADG (Kanpur zone) and then-ASP Lucknow (east) Harish Kumar who is DIG Police Training School (Gorakhpur).Saying it saw no need for prosecution of the two, the government has sought departmental action against Prakash and charged him with minor penalties. Kumar will have to undergo a departmental inquiry but face major penalties.The government has granted prosecution sanction against then-CO ( Hazratganj ) BS Garbayal, then-SHO Hussainganj-Baliram Saroj and 14 others, accused of framing innocent people instead of the real arsonists.On July 15, 2009, Joshi had attacked the Mayawati government’s policy of giving monetary compensation to Dalit rape survivors. In her speech, she had allegedly made a derogatory reference to then CM Mayawati.“Will Mayawati settle for a compensation of Rs 1 crore if she were to suffer the indignity herself,” she had said. A few hours later, Joshi was arrested. After investigation, she was remanded to judicial custody for 14 days by the chief judicial magistrate.On the same night, a group of masked men stormed Joshi’s house at Sarojini Naidu Marg in Lucknow armed with iron rods, sticks and petrol cans. They went on the rampage, sprinkled petrol and set the house ablaze.CB-CID investigation found the role of then- BSP MLA Jitendra Kumar Singh alias Bablu along with Intezar Abidi alias Bobby in the arson.In 2015, CB-CID had sought prosecution of 18 police officers for framing innocent people for the incident."

PATNA: Widespread arson vandalism and disruption of rail and road traffic marked the Bharat bandh in Bihar on Monday even as the Centre held the protesters responsible for the death of a girl in Jehanabad while being taken to a hospital.Slamming the Congress, Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad cited the death of the 2-year-old girl as he claimed the pro-bandh supporters prevented the girl from getting timely medical attention. He asked whether Congress president Rahul Gandhi would take responsibility for the death. However, Jehanabad DM Alok Ranjan Ghosh denied the allegation and blamed diarrhoea for her death.The bandh was called by the Congress and supported in Bihar by RJD, Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular), Nationalist Congress Party, Samajwadi Party and the six-party Left combine of CPI(ML), CPI, CPM, SUCI, Forward Bloc and RSP against unchecked rise in the prices of petrol, diesel and LPG, among other issues.The supporters of suspended RJD MP Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav, the patron of Jan Adhikar Party-Loktantrik (JAP-L), went on the rampage in the state capital and vandalized cars, buses and auto-rickshaws plying on the roads and roughed up commuters. The police resorted to severe lathicharge at the Income Tax roundabout to clear the blockade erected by JAP-L supporters to make the passage for a high court judge’s car.Incidentally, the JAP-L led by Pappu Yadav had not been invited to support the bandh. Without taking names, the leader of opposition in the state assembly and de facto RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav accused Pappu of being the “agent” of the BJP to do “negative politics” on its behalf. Tejashwi also called him “less of a leader and more of an actor” whose party workers indulged in violence to “bring bad name to the state.” Tejashwi joined the bandh around 12.30pm.State BJP chief Nityanand Rai alleged that the workers of RJD and Congress indulged in hooliganism and smashing of the government and private vehicles. “They forcibly closed the shops. Congress president Rahul Gandhi and Tejashwi should be held responsible for violence during the bandh,” he added.At least 50 pairs of passenger trains were forcibly detained by the bandh supporters at different places under the East Central Railway (ECR). ECR’s chief public relations officer Rajesh Kumar said the Danapur division was the worst affected. “Bandh supporters did not allow movement of at least 20 passenger trains on the Kiul-Gaya, Patna-Gaya, Patna-Jhajha, Rajgir-Bakhtiarpur, Mokama-Barauni and Patna-Mughalsarai sections since early morning,” he said.According to a release issued by the DGP control room, 678 people were held across the state by way of preventive arrests, the maximum number of which took place in Patna district (219) followed by Gopalganj (214), Nalanda (141) and Aurangabad (61).Vehicles remained off the roads for the major part of the day in 38 district and over 600 small and medium towns besides the subdivisional and block headquarters. Passengers at Patna Junction and Mithapur bus stand were stranded and hugely inconvenienced. Protesters clashed with police personnel in some localities and forced shopkeepers to down their shutters. Most of the private schools and colleges remained closed.Student organisations affiliated to different political parties marched from Darbhanga House to Kargil Chowk while JAP(L) supporters blocked railway tracks at Rajendra Nagar Terminal.Some shops, which had been opened in the morning, were forcefully closed by the bandh supporters. Raman Choudhary, who runs a garment shop at Rajdhani Market, said the protesters forced him to down the shutters and warned him with dire consequences if he disobeyed them.Even cinema halls in the state capital remained closed. Saroj Kumar, who had booked movie tickets, was disappointed as the e-tickets were automatically cancelled when he reached the hall along with his friend.Normal functioning in banks was also affected as very few customers turned up in the first half. Sonam Kumari, a bank employee, said the footfall of customers was less comparing to other days in the morning hours. “However, the customers started visiting our bank branch after the lunch break. We also faced difficulties in reaching the bank due to lack of public transport on roads,” she said.Few vehicles, including cars, motorcycles, auto-rickshaws, e-rickshaws and cycle rickshaws were, however, seen plying in some localities. Sarvottam Kumar Singh, a private firm employee, said bandhs should not be organised on working days as they cause inconvenience to common people."

MEERUT: A day after a massive fire tore through Meerut ’s Bhusamandi locality and reduced over 100 houses to ashes, inconsolable people of the area picked up pieces from the ruins which presented a gloomy picture. The blaze started Wednesday evening, soon after a widespread clash between locals and police teams which had come to clear encroachments in the area. The ash-laden air was also thick with allegations and counter-allegations over who started the fire. Locals blamed police for the fire, a charge denied by senior officers.Most of the people whose homes were destroyed in the fire were forced to spend night in open, even as the winter chill continued to take its toll.Meanwhile, a magisterial inquiry was also ordered by the administration into the entire incident. Police force accompanied by Rapid Action Force RAF ) contingents were also deployed in the area. Two FIRs were also filed in the case, one by Sadar police station and the other by Cantonment Board.Zulfikar Ali, a daily wage labourer who lost all the items he had bought for his daughter’s marriage, blamed police and property dealer. “Everything is destroyed including products worth Rs 1.5 lakhs I had arranged for my daughter’s wedding. I don’t know what my fault was. I had purchased this 30 sq yard land from a property dealer and had built four walls with a tin roof where my family of nine lived. On Wednesday, police came and tried to demolish several homes. When we resisted, they set the locality on fire.”Police have refuted the charges.Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Nitin Tiwari said: “The allegations are completely false. Why would police set up fire? At the same time we cannot say that the residents did it. The reason is still not known. Most probably it was caused by accident. Magisterial inquiry is on and everything will be clear once it is complete. Meanwhile, two FIRs have been filed, one by the Sadar police and another by Cantonment Board against unknown persons. Once investigations begin, miscreants will be identified on the basis of evidence and adequate action will be taken against them.”"

KOLKATA: The Burrabazar police on Sunday arrested Kushal Gupta, BJP's North Kolkata Yuva Morcha vice-president, for setting a state bus on fire off the Brabourne Road flyover on September 26, during a BJP bandh.Gupta was arrested at the Kolkata airport immediately on return to the city on a Varanasi-Kolkata flight.Cops said Gupta had been on the run since they arrested Sanjib Singh (Chulbul), a Naihati resident, who got his hands burnt while setting the bus ablaze. Police sources said the FIR lodged cited 7-8 persons for trying to set the bus, with seven passengers in it, on fire. The attackers had reportedly shouted, ""Bandh- er dine kaaj dekhachish, puriye marbo sobaike. (You are working on a bandh day, we will burn you alive)"". Police claimed two persons, including Sanjib, had entered the bus while the others, including Gupta, tried to stop people from stepping out.Gupta is a Burrabazar resident. ""His mother and brother stay here. His brother is a shop-owner. Gupta has been a strong BJP activist for the past two-and-a-half years,"" said an officer. With his name cropping up during the probe, the Burrabazar police launched a manhunt for him but could not track him. According to sources, while the cops were studying the passenger lists of Kolkata-bound aircraft, they stumbled on his name and arrested him upon arrival. ""He probably thought that the dust had settled and that it was safe for him to return,"" said a senior police officer.Police said witnesses who recorded their statements claimed they clearly remembered seeing a man in yellow kurta and white pyjamas getting on the bus armed with a bottle of liquid. They also claimed multiple people were seen shouting pro-bandh slogans, egging on the two men who had climbed onto the bus. Multiple passengers - including the injured Vidyasagar traffic guard constable Bidesh Samanta, one of the bus passengers, some daily wage-earners and the bus employees - also recalled Singh getting his hands burnt while setting the bus on fire. The reports from the hospital match their statements, police said.No BJP leader agreed to be quoted on this. ""We are keeping a close watch,"" said a leader."

PUNE: The police on Saturday arrested four members of a mandal for setting ablaze a man’s motorcycle after he refused to give them Rs500 as a “voluntary contribution” for the Dahi Handi festival.The incident took place at Ambegaon Pathar during the wee hours of Saturday. Two motorcycles, parked on either side of the gutted motorcycle, also sustained damage. The photographer, Praful Chandrakant Thorat (20) of Ambegaon, has lodged a complaint with the Bharati Vidyapeeth police.The police later arrested the mandal members, identified as Datta Vijay Shinde, Omkar Sandeep Kamble, Datta Rahul Kadam and Sumeet Raju Ahiwale, all residents of Katraj.According to the FIR, the incident took place at around 1.35am on Saturday. Shinde had gone to Thorat’s residence and informed them the mandal was celebrating Dahi Handi on Monday. Shinde then demanded a voluntary contribution of Rs500 from Thorat.When Thorat refused to pay up, the men set ablaze his motorcycle. Speaking to TOI, Chandrakant Thorat said, “Me and my son were not at home when the mandal members visited around 9.30pm on Saturday. My wife told them to speak to me. I came home and met the mandal members downstairs. I promised them a contribution of Rs51,” he said.Thorat said, “I am an autorickshaw driver. I work the entire day and get Rs500 by the evening. The amount was too high for me and so I requested them to take Rs51 as a voluntary contribution, which is all I can afford to pay,” he said.“They threatened me when I told them that they cannot force me to shell out Rs500,” he said. It is suspected that the mandal members took petrol from the fuel tank of a motorcycle parked near Thorat’s. “Our motorcycle has a fuel lock.

THANE: As many as 18 bikes were completely charred and a laundry unit was partially damaged in Chandanwadi area of Thane in the wee hours of Tuesday. The police immediately tracked down the accused and arrested him. The incident has triggered fear among locals as this is the third arson incident in less than 20 days.During interrogation, accused, Gaurav Palvi, 21, a resident of Chandanwadi area told the police that personal rivalry with one of the bike owners was motivation for the crime.DCP DS Swamy said that the complainant, Tushar Bhoir, owns a laundry in the basement of one of the three buildings in a housing society.A couple of days back, Bhoir had an altercation with Palvi’s uncle. Bhoir was beaten up and a non-cognizable offence registered against Palvi’s uncle with Naupada police. Palvi decided to take revenge and torched Bhoir’s bike. Due to the fuel, the fire spread to other bikes which were completely charred. The laundry was also partially damaged. Bhoir’s loss is compounded by the fact that he did not have insurance for the bike.The police said the accused was tracked on the basis of information as well as CCTV footage. The accused is said to be a close aide of a goon in the city and has been earlier arrested for rioting, said the officer.The police, in this case, have booked the accused for attempt to commit culpable homicide , mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house, mischief causing damage.On December 6, around nine two-wheelers were burnt down and two arrested. Personal feud had triggered the crime. The police said a local had registered two non-cognizable complaints against one of the accused and he wanted to teach him a lesson.On December 14, three bikes were set on fire in Patlipada and history-sheeter Chetan Thakur was arrested. He was inebriated and had even smashed the window panes of three cars.Alleging inept patrolling, locals slammed the Thane police for their casual attitude toward the law and order situation in the city. The police, on the other hand, blamed it on illegal parking on roads.A police officer added, “Such incidents occur mostly due to old cases of rivalry. The intention may not be to harm the rival directly, but cause financial loss and inflict agony.”"

CHANDIGARH: A day after finance minister Capt Abhimanyu accused ex-CM Bhupinder Hooda and his men of targeting his family, HPCC chief Ashok Tanwar said on Sunday that the persons who attacked him in New Delhi appeared to be the same who are now accused of vandalism at finance minister Captain Abhimanyu’s house during the Jat stir in February 2016.The finance minister, in an exclusive interview to TOI, had categorically said that his house and family were targeted by the people connected to Hooda and not activists involved in the Jat reservation movement.Speaking to TOI, Tanwar reiterated, “On Saturday, while I was in Samalkha, some of our supporters showed me the statements made by Capt Abhimanyu and details provided by him. Our supporters said that the accused were the same who had attacked me and other Congressmen in New Delhi,” he said.“There are one year, nine months and eight days left. We are counting the delay caused by inefficient police and inefficient government. Let the Congress come to power, and we shall get everything probed,” added Tanwar.However, he refused to comment on the in-house panel constituted by the party to look into the circumstances that led to the attack on him on October 6, 2016. Hooda’s supporters, included his personal security officer, had allegedly attacked Tanwar and his supporters ahead of a procession by Congress president Rahul Gandhi.A couple of cases were registered on a complaint filed by Navdeep Singh Dalal, a supporter of Tanwar. Among those named in the FIR is Hooda’s personal security officer Satish Rathi.Meanwhile, Krishan Murti Hooda, a known supporter of Hooda, flayed Capt Abhimanyu for suggesting that vandals were linked to the ex-CM. Interestingly, Murti’s son Gaurav Hooda too has been named as an accused by the CBI in the chargesheet filed in the case of violence at the minister’s house.Earlier this month, CBI had submitted chargesheet against 51 persons, which included 10 names, allegedly linked to Hooda and his men."

Babloo's name came to light in 2011 during the probe. He was arrested subsequently but later released on bail.In the petition, Babloo alleged that, the police came to his house to arrest him again on May 10, 2017. The police told his family members that sections 307, 147 and 149 of IPC have also been added in the charges and since he was not on bail in these sections, he has to be arrested.A year after police move to arrest him again, Babloo filed a petition in the high court recently against addition of charges against him.

BHOPAL: 24 trucks were set on fire by an angry mob after a 28-year-old farmer was run over by a dumper ferrying sand from Narmada river basin in Madhya Pradesh's Hoshangabad district . Police have found a charred body from the spot, which they claim, was of a youth from the same village where arson took place. Additional force has been deployed in the area.Congress has attacked BJP government on the issue. Congress state president Kamalnath told a section of that illegal sand mining was rampant in the entire state. “Jahan nadi, wahan Khanan, jahan Khanan waha BJP k neta” (If there is a river, there is mining, and if there is mining there must be BJP leader), Kamanath said.Krishna Kumar Yadav was pillion riding his uncle Dev Narayan Yadav on a motorcycle, on their way home, when a speeding dumper, laden with sand, hit them from behind near Gujjarwada village under Babai police station area.The incident took place at around 11.30pm and the spot is located around 35 km from the district headquarters, said police.Krishna Kumar got under the wheels and died on the spot, while Dev Narayan, a former sarpanch of Gujjarwada village, sustained major injuries, said police.Infuriated over the accident, locals set fire to that dumper and 23 other trucks that were ferrying sand on that route. All drivers managed to escape. Around 18 trucks were loaded with sand, while six were heading towards the mining spot.SHO of Babai police station, his team and fire brigade were also targeted by villagers pelting stones. One of the police vehicle was also set on fire. “Those indulging in arson and vandalism are being identified, Hosshangabad SP Arvind Saxena told TOI.“We have rescued around 175 trucks in our over night operation. Villagers have torched 24 trucks, 18 partially,” said the officer. A charred body found from the spot has been identified as Ramesh Yadav, of Gujjarwada village. “Either he was part of the mob or must have been passing by when the trucks were set on fire. He had a skull injury which could be due to the burst of burning tyres,” said the officer. There are two sand mines in the area one is at Gujjarwada and other one at Rajon. “Trucks set on fire were ferrying sand from the Rajon mines. Most of the trucks were from Indore and Ujjain,” SP said. Riot control vehicle was also pressed into service to in wake of the situation. Additional police force has been deployed in the area in wake of the boiling situation.In October 2017, Madhya Pradesh government had allowed sand mining rivers across the state after four months ban hoping to provide sand at cheap rates than open market and rein in the mining mafia.The government had also decided to hand over sand mining rights to the gram panchayats, it was also stated that decision on the royalty would be taken by the panchayat itself which includes rights to engage transporters and labourers to extract sand from their own resources. A detailed feasibility report from the expert committee is awaited, said the officials.In February 2017 Congress leader Arun Yadav had written to the prime minister Narendra Modi, urging him for a probe into alleged involvement of chief minister’s relatives in illegal sand mining.Yadav wrote, illegal sand mining was rampant in entire state because of political protection and incidents like murder of an IPS officer and attacks on government officials were common and that majority of illegal sand mining was being carried out in home district of CM.He had also alleged that more than 1000 dumpers full of illegal sand were being mined and transported in the area. And, those involvement have gone to the extent of building a temporary bridge on Narmada at the Joshipur-Jarrapur border of Sehore for the illegal transportation.In Video: Trucks ferrying sand set on fire after farmer's death in MP’s Hoshangabad"

BENGALURU: Friday’s fire at Bellandur Lake has sparked off worry among hundreds of residents living in apartments on the periphery.Giridhar V, a resident of Sun City Euphoria apartments, said burning grass near the lake in summer was a common sight. “It’s surprising to see grass catching fire at this time of year. If the wind was blowing in the direction of the apartment, we would have had a tough time. The authorities should ensure this doesn’t happen again,” he said.A senior official from the urban development department said a team of officials had inspected the lake banks, and reported that the cause of the fire could be arson. “While most of the 900-acre lake has been fenced, there are still pockets which are open to trespassers. Some miscreants might have gained access to the lake banks and set the dry grass or garbage piles there on fire. Floating grass on the water body was also on fire. The government is likely to take a decision to cordon off the entire lake till the STPs under construction are completed. The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board has been directed to check the chemical levels in the lake and we expect a report on Saturday,” he added.By afternoon, the fire on Bellandur Lake started spreading towards the defence area nearby. Hundreds of armymen jumped into action and after several hours of operations, they managed to douse the blaze and stopped it from entering the army area.In a statement, the defence PRO said, “There was an outbreak of fire at Bellandur Lake area around 12noon. This started spreading towards the Army area. The fire which had come up to the perimeter of the Army location has been put out due to the untiring efforts of more than 5,000 Army personnel and fire-fighting equipment of ASC College and Centre. Army personnel are still alert to prevent its spread into Army and adjoining civil area. The 5,000 Army personnel was led by Major General NS Rajpurohit , deputy commandant and chief instructor, ASC College and Centre. This immediate action resulted in effectively containing the fire...""This is not the first time the lake has spat fire. In 2017, taking suo motu cognizance of the state of the lake following a similar fire incident in February, the National Green Tribunal ( NGT ) had come down hard on the city’s civic agencies for failing to clean up the lake.However, the actual cleaning of the lake and its redevelopment is possible only after 2020. Officials of the high level panel constituted to chalk out a plan to rejuvenate the water body informed the NGT a few months ago that the lake can be cleaned only when sewage flow into the water body stops.The Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) which is installing sewage treatment plants (STPs) to stop waste from entering the lake, will be able to complete these projects only by 2020.“Desilting or cleaning work at the lake can be taken up only after 2020, when sewage flow stops. Otherwise, it would be a waste of money as the revival would cost us around Rs 500 crore. The same has been informed to the Tribunal,” said a senior BDA official."

PUNE: The Kothrud police on Thursday booked two men for setting the house of a 55-year-old woman on fire and damaging four vehicles and a CCTV camera at the Shastrinagar slums at around 3am.In another incident, three men vandalised at least seven vehicles at the Shikshak colony in Thergaon at around 11.15 am on Wednesday.SS Dhotre, the sub-inspector of Kothrud police, said the Shastrinagar incident was the result of old and ongoing enmity between the two men and the woman.“At about 3 am, the woman woke up from sleep and went to use the toilet. Taking advantage of the situation, the two suspects — one Dada Kudale and his accomplice — set her house on fire. The suspects later vandalised the vehicle that belonged to the woman’s son,” Dhotre said.“Subsequently, they damaged two other vehicles and a CCTV camera. They also targetted a two-wheeler parked on the road before fleeing the spot,” she said.The woman has lodged an FIR under various sections of the Indian Penal Code. “We have launched a hunt to arrest the two suspects at the earliest,” she added.Meanwhile, in Thergaon, three men riding on a motorcycle intercepted 43-year-old Mahesh Taru and vandalised his vehicle. When Taru tried to stop them, one of the suspects threatened him with a sickle and robbed him of Rs 1,000.The suspects then sped away on their motorcycle. The suspects vandalised at least seven three and four-wheelers on the same day."

At about 11.45pm, a group of about 20 persons — consisting of ‘boys wearing shorts’ who were from the hostel — tried to break down their door and managed to gain entry.“According to the complaint, she was allegedly molested by the group and they dragged her husband and son out of the house and beat them up. She also suffered injuries in the incident. Her neighbour was also beaten up. When she went to VS Hospital, she learned that about 19 others had also been beaten up by the mob,” said an Ellisbridge police official.A crowd of over 200 persons gathered outside Ellisbridge police station on Tuesday morning, demanding justice for the victims of the Monday night’s violence and the closure of the hostel, run by the Akhil Gujarat Rajput Yuva Sangh, in the area. Those who gathered at the police station alleged that the teasing of a woman had triggered the incident. Only after police filed an FIR did the crowd disperse.

Aurangabad DM Rahul Ranjan Mahiwal said the procession was passing through the pre-determined route in presence of magistrates and security personnel when the incident took place.Patna zonal IG Nayyar Hasnain Khan said additional police forces were deployed in the area to bring the situation under control. “At least five persons have been arrested in connection with the clashes,” he added.Some other districts too remained on the edge. In Siwan, clashes erupted when people from a particular community stopped a Ram Navami procession at Nizampur village under Maaharulhaq Nagar police station area of the district. Siwan ASP Kartikeya Sharma said the miscreants also damaged a school building owned by a man from minority community in the neighbouring Rampur village. The ASP said central forces have been deployed in the area to avoid any untoward incident.At Mughalpura under Chainpur police station area in Kaimur, some motorcycle-borne youths participating in a Ram Navami procession allegedly raised objectionable slogans in front of a mosque. It soon snowballed into a clash in which two persons sustained minor injuries, the IG said.In Gaya, miscreants pelted stones at a Ram Navami procession under Kothi police station area of the district. As the situation turned tense, police swung into action and dispersed the violent mob."

Chandigarh: Dismissing the bail pleas of several accused involved in rioting and arson that had erupted after conviction of Dera Sacha Sauda (DSS) head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh in late August 2017 in rape cases, the Punjab and Haryana high court has held that courts cannot be lenient to those “who had threatened the very existence and majesty of law”.Observing that “faith does not teach cruelty and violence against other human beings, rather it is used for uniting and strengthening the people at large,” the HC made it clear that terrorizing public at large is a heinous crime and should be dealt with stern hand.HC was also of the view that if the accused were released at this stage, there were chances that they would try to influence the prime witnesses of the case.Justice Mahabir Singh Sindhu passed these orders while dismissing a bunch of petitions seeking bail by Sital and others who are facing charges of attempt to murder, damaging public property and under the Explosive Substance Act in Mansa town of Punjab on August 25, 2017, after Gurmeet was convicted by a Panchkula court.Allegations are that they were raising slogans “Dhan Dhan Satguru Tera Hi Aasra” and were shouting that their ‘father Sant Gurmeet’ had been convicted and lesson was to be taught for his conviction. They had set several vehicles on fire by using petrol bombs and also damaged buildings.“The petitioners had a very desperate idea to destabilize the society on account of conviction of Dera chief and to put an extreme pressure on the government and the court to release the convict in a rape case. Meaning thereby, the petitioners have no respect for court of law and thus, when they have threatened the very existence and majesty of the law, then there is no occasion for this court to take an undue lenient view in their favour; rather they deserve no concession for releasing on bail,” observed Justice Sindhu while dismissing their bail petitions.HC, however, directed the trial court to examine the complainants in the case as early as possible in view of the fact that they have taken the risk to come forward against the present petitioners.The court also directed the Punjab police to take due care of the life and liberty of complainants as well as their families considering the sensitivity of the case.Petitioners were seeking bail on the ground that they are in custody since long, investigation has been completed and charges have been framed against them and nothing is to be recovered from them. It was also contended that the petitioners were not named in the FIR as they were alleged to be with muffled faces and were booked four days after the FIR.Objecting to their plea, the state government submitted that the petitioners have threatened the very existence of the court of law by their action. Actually, two cars were put on fire by the petitioners and they also entered in the office of Income Tax thereby throwing the petrol bottles, match boxes and baseball bats and created an absolute terror in the city."

GURUGRAM: Residents of Bhondsi organised a mahapanchayat at 11am on Sunday to demand the release of those youth from their village who have been apprehended for arson and vandalism — including setting a Roadways bus on fire and attacking a school bus carrying children — as part of their agitation against the makers of film Padmaavat.On January 24, around 18 youths from Bhondsi were apprehended by Gurgoan police, of which two juveniles have been acquitted since then. On Sunday, villager Sanjay Raghav said, “It’s unfair that instead of catching the hooligans who posed a threat to the villagers as well, cops framed our innocent children.”The villagers have been saying the apprehended youth, who were picked up by police, were returning from tuition or sports practice, or were mere spectators to the vandalism.“If cops have any evidence against them, they should show it to everyone. They have nothing against our children. Once tainted with a police record, the youths’ future will be spoiled,” said Pradeep The parents of those apprehended have threatened to start an agitation if the youth are not released. They have decided to meet deputy commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh and police commissioner Sandeep Khirwar on Monday, seeking their intervention in the matter. The villagers have already met the chief minister on January 31, but have not received any assurance from him.“We want an impartial probe in the matter. We seek justice from these officials and hope they will find the actual culprits,” said Bishan Singh."

MADURAI: Lambasting police and a subordinate court for letting go Scott-free the authors of Dinakaran newspaper office arson case, that left three people dead in 2007, Madras high court reversed an order of acquittal and sentenced nine people to life imprisonment on Thursday. The convicts include 'Attack' Pandi, a former aide of ousted DMK leader M K Alagiri, and deputy superintendent of police Rajaram. However, in the case of the latter the court would disclose the quantum of jail term on March 25.The court further directed the Tamil Nadu government to pay a compensation of Rs 5 lakh each to the families of the bereaved within a period of three months.Citing that the trial court acquitted all the accused because almost every witness turned hostile, a division bench of justice P N Prakash and justice B Pugalendhi said it was unfortunate that the trial court had abdicated its judicial responsibility to seek the truth and, instead, deployed a specious line of reasoning to arrive at a verdict of acquittal.“If a witness becomes hostile to subvert the judicial process, the court shall not stand as a mute spectator and every effort should be made to bring home the truth. Criminal justice system cannot be overturned by those gullible witnesses who act under pressure, inducement or intimidation,” said the bench.Dinakaran office at Madurai in 2007 was torched by vandals on May 9, 2007, after it published the results of an opinion poll which suggested that M K Stalin had greater public approval as political successor to DMK patriarch M Karunanidhi than his elder brother M K Alagiri. Three Dinakaran staff members -- Vinoth Kumar, Gopinath and Muthuramalingam -- were killed in the incident. The case was later taken over by the CBI, which booked 17 people, including the then DSP Rajaram, for facilitating the attack.On December 9, 2009, the trial court acquitted the accused of all charges, as key witnesses turned hostile. In all, of the 83 prosecution witnesses 49 turned hostile. It included 21 police personnel and 15 witnesses from the press, including colleagues of the deceased.Calling the bluff of the prosecution, the bench headed by justice Prakash said there could be no greater affront to administration of justice than erroneous acquittals in criminal cases resulting from witnesses turning hostile. “The very edifice of the criminal law is compromised when the enforcement machinery of the State is subverted and the perpetrators of crime walk out Scott-free,” the bench stated.As ‘Attack’ Pandi is already in Palayamkottai prison, serving time in connection with another case, the court directed the other accused -- Prabhu, Vijaya Pandi, P Kandasamy, G Ramaiah Pandian, V Sudhakar, Thirumurugan @ Kattuvasi Murugan, I Ruban and Malik Batcha -- to be secured.The court set aside the acquittal of the DSP Rajaram and convicted him for lesser offences under Sections 217 (public servant disobeying law to save person from punishment) and 221 (intentionally omits to apprehend a suspect) of IPC. It directed Rajaram to appear before the court on March 25 to decide on quantum of his sentence."

Panchkula: A fortnight after violence erupted following the court verdict against Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, many residents whose vehicles, belongings and household items were damaged are still running from pillar to post to complete the formalities related to their cases and claims.The victims are having a tough time in formalities like police reports on forms that will enable them to get back their property or taking reports from the cops.Police had taken into custody goods and vehicles or moveable properties damaged by the rioters in the violence. Since these have become case properties, individuals have to follow the procedure of “supurdari” to get them released.At least dozen such victims could be seen running from one desk to another of lawyers and to Sector 5 police station to get the process completed recently.“Police have completed its work by registering the case. Now, they don’t have available manpower for reporting the queries made by magistrate for release of belonging or vehicle,’’ said a resident of Sector 4 whose car was damaged.A vendor, whose two-wheeler was damaged, said, “We know there is a procedure, but the way they have announced compensation, they should have first created a system for completion of formalities,’’ he said.Panchkula DCP Manbir Singh assured to set up a special help desk at the Sector 5 police station. “We have just come to know about this problem. We shall start a special help desk for these victims and they shall not have any kind of problem in completion of police formalities,’’ he said.Nidhi Bansal, secretary, District Legal Services Authority, said she has directed para legal volunteers and front office team to help the victims. “We are always there for help. Our volunteers will help them in getting the forms related to supurdari and release orders of the vehicles or belongings,’’ she said.What is supurdariAccording to rules, “supurdari” is getting possession of goods from a police station. The victim has to approach the ilaqa magistrate who asks the SHO of a police station for the report. After the SHO gives its report, the magistrate issues the release order after getting a surety bond."

These miscreants were backed by some local politicians, who had grudges against police and local administration, who in the past had come down heavily on their illegal activities of sand-mining.”“The clash on Republic Day morning was unfortunate and should never have happened, but what happened later was a deliberate attempt to hamper peace and tranquility in the district,” he said.Meanwhile, on Sunday night, two houses in Manuta Colony and PLGC Colony of Nadraigate area, along with a small grocery store on Station Road, were set on fire by miscreants - though the fire was promptly doused and no injury was reported.Responding on the late night arson, Sunil Kumar Singh said, “The unruly men engaged in arson have been targeting those areas which are on outskirts of Kasganj city and their intention is to remain in headlines, so that they can pressure the administration to release the accused arrested in criminal activities.”On Monday, district magistrate R P Singh, along with SP Sunil Kumar Singh, visited the family of Chandan Gupta alias Abhishek who lost his life in the recent violence. The senior officers gave a Rs 20 lakh-compensation cheque to Chandan’s father Sushil Gupta.Later, men of right wing group visited Chandan’s home and demanded a compensation of Rs 50 lakh for the family, a house and government job for a family member.UP Vishva Hindu Parishad vice president Sunil Parashar said, “Like Mohammad Akhlaq, the state government should also compensate Chandan’s family and pay Rs 50 lakh, one house and a government job for a relative.”Meanwhile, the Rapid Action Force and Provincial Armed Constabulary were still deployed in Kasganj city to avoid further clashes."

MUMBAI: In view of the violence that marred the bandh called in other parts of Maharashtra on Tuesday, Maratha groups have appealed to the community to observe Wednesday's bandh in the city in a peaceful manner. Vinod Patil, one of the Maratha Kranti Morcha's conveyors who attended its meeting held in Dadar to finalize the bandh call, said, ""We do not want to disrupt the life of common people."" He added the group's agitation will continue in other parts of the state.Mumbai police have said they will be alert and deploy an adequate number of personnel. A senior police officer said, ""We will be deploying cops from police stations and platoons of the State Reserve Police Force."" Quick Response Team commandos and Home Guards too will be called in if required, the officer said.Taxi union leader A L Quadros said he has not taken any decision to support the bandh but said the decision on plying would be taken depending on the situation in the morning. ""If there is risk of driving and fear of being attacked, cabbies will stay off roads,"" he said. Auto union leader Shashank Rao said they were not supporting the bandh and rickshaws would ply unless there was violence and attacks on drivers/autos.The state's announcement of a mega recruitment for 72,000 government jobs sparked the fresh round of agitation. Marathas are demanding the government reserve 16% jobs in this drive for the community, and leaders of all parties, including BJP, support the demand. But with the decision on quota pending in court, the community is not sure of the validity of the reservation and wants the government to postpone recruitment till the court's verdict is in.Asked about the state's appeals for discussions on the issue, Patil said, ""Our demands have not changed, so there is no need to discuss the issue again.""On the agitation turning violent, one convenor said, ""This is anger against the government for not keeping its promises, and it escalated after a farmer participating in the agitation in Aurangabad was washed away on Monday.""The Shiv Sena has said the report of the Maharashtra State Commission for Backward Classes cannot be prepared in haste as it has to stand up to legal scrutiny. ""The previous Rane panel report was scrapped by courts. The committee established by our government will have to make a sound report so the stay on quota can be vacated,"" said Sena minister Subhash Desai. ""The previous government that gave assurances without doing its homework should be held responsible for the mess today,"" he added. The commission is currently holding public hearings. It will study data on the Maratha community's representation."

VARANASI: Tension prevailed on the BHU campus on Sunday even as the city witnessed protests and minor skirmishes after a night of violence and arson over the issue of eve-teasing. Except for minor scuffles between police and a group of students trying to take out a peace march, no other untoward incident took place on the campus. The university administration has advanced the puja holidays from September 28 to 25. The campus will now be opened on October 3.On Saturday night, protests against the alleged sexual harassment of a student took a violent turn on the campus when seven students, including girls, and two journalists were injured in lathicharge. Police were able to bring the situation under control only by 3 am on Sunday . Tension prevailed on the campus through the day , forcing the university administration to advance the puja holidays from September 28 to 25. The campus will now be opened on October 3.The protesting students were trying to enter the vicechancellor's house on Saturday night when they were caned.In retaliation, students reportedly hurled petrol bombs and resorted to brick-batting in which some policemen were injured. Violence erupted at BHU hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi left his Lok Sabha constituency after a two-day visit. Taking cognizance of the violence, CM Aditya Nath Yogi has sought a report from divisional commissioner Nitin Gokarn. With the campus under the shadow of over 1,500 securitymen on Sunday, frantic political activity took place outside with former student union leaders, academics and employees taking out an all-party march. UP Congress Committee chief Raj Babbar and former Congress MP PL Punia were detained while trying to reach the campus, but were released later. Security forces staged a flag march late Sunday evening.The district administration also announced that other universities, including Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapeeth, Sampurnanand Sanskrit University and colleges affiliated to them, would remain closed till October 2.Trouble started in BHU on the night of September 21 when students of a girls' hostel sat on protest following the sexual harassment of a student of visual arts near Bharat Kala Bhawan.The girl was harassed by three boys on a motorcycle while she was returning to her hostel in Triveni complex and students alleged that campus security guards who were standing just 100 metres from the spot didn't react.The victim said her war den, instead of taking up the issue, asked her why she was returning to her hostel late.The warden's response angered the fellow inmates, who sat on a `dharna' after Thursday. In all, three FIRs had been lodged by the BHU administration--first for the sexual harassment of the girl student on September 21 evening, second for the violence on the campus and the third for display of provocative photograph on a Facebook page `BHU Buzz' that was used for live streaming of violence on Saturday night.The students who sat on a dharna after September 21 midnight continued their protests at the women's college on September 22, the day Modi landed in the city . This forced the administration to change the route of PM's convoy which was to cross the area to visit the Durga Kund temple on Friday evening.The sit-in continued throughout Saturday. A heavy posse of security forces stationed on the campus gate didn't allow the protesters to come out as the PM was in town.However, violence erupted on Saturday night when a group of girl students accompanied by some boys tried to enter the V-C's house to meet him.The security guards of the university stopped them and the police were informed.BHU administration said subsequently , there was stone-pelting by `outsiders' who had joined the students.BHU later issued a statement saying the 'dharna' by the students just a day before the PM's visit was `politically motivated' to malign the image of the university.DM Yogeshwar Ram Mishra and SSP RK Bhardwaj said that police had to resort to lathicharge to bring the situation under control."

CHANDIGARH: The CBI would move an application before the Supreme Court (SC) seeking amendment to its January 31 orders through which the apex court had directed that the trial in the case relating to the burning of Haryana finance minister Captain Abhimanyu’s residence in Rohtak be completed within six months.This was stated by Counsel for the CBI, Sumeet Goel, before the Punjab and Haryana high court on Thursday, in response to the allegations that CBI had not even started the probe in the case. The allegations were levelled by Abhimanyu’s brother Major Satyapal Sindhu.Sindhu’s counsel senior advocate R S Rai told the HC that in January, the SC had already ordered to complete the trial within six months whereas the CBI was yet to start an investigation in the matter.The main argument of Sindhu’s lawyer was that failure of the CBI to complete the probe might benefit main accused Dilawar Singh , who could approach the court for bail, citing delay in investigations. His main plea was that even after taking over the case, the premier agency had not even begun the probe.However, the CBI counsel submitted before the HC that whatever needed to be done in the case had been done by the agency and they would soon submit a status report before the court. The CBI counsel also clarified that the agency had already decided to move an application before the SC seeking modification of the orders requesting that such six months period should be counted from the date of filing of chargesheet by the agency before the court.Hearing this, division bench comprising Justice S S Saron and Justice Avneesh Jhingan adjourned the hearing of the case for October 12.On January 31, the apex court had ordered that the trial of the cases related to attack on Abhimanyu’s house be completed within six months while dismissing the bail plea of Dilawar Singh, an ex-serviceman who was leading the mob that had set the house on fire in Rohtak during last year’s violence. HC, however, had denied him the bail.Dilawar had approached the apex court after the Punjab and Haryana high court had dismissed his bail plea in December 2016 observing that his release may influence the prosecution witnesses.Three cases related to attack on Captain Abhimanyu’s house, his school and his newspaper press building are being investigated by the CBI after the Haryana government had handed it over to the investigation agency."

NAGPUR: The fire in under construction restaurant in JP Square , the six-storey commercial complex at Law College Square , on Sunday night was case of arson, the police said. Sitabuldi police have registered an offence against four unidentified persons under Section 436 of IPC (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy property) on the basis of CCTVs footage. It is probably a first-of-its-kind case in the city.PSI Nitin Vitole from Sitabuldi police station told TOI footage from nearby cameras show four youths entering the building and coming out 36 minutes later. “We collected footages of CCTVs installed by Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) at Law College square and on two buildings behind the petrol pump and adjacent to JP square building. Youths entered the building from West High Court (WHC) road gate at 1.35am. They came out again from the same gate at 2.11am and fled,” he said.Vitole added the owner of the bar and restaurant Arjun Jitendrapalsingh Chhabra had lodged complaint alleging fire was mischief on Monday. “Chhabra in his complaint said there was no power connection and no one were present on the fourth floor. He himself had locked the floor around 6.30pm on Sunday. Further details can be known once the four are identified,” he said.TOI is having the CCTVs footage in its possession. It shows five youths entering the building. It has two gates- one on Amravati road and other on WHC road. Two youths walked from Amravati road and jumped over the gate at 1.35am. Two minutes later, three more youths came and did the same. On coming out, four of them ran towards Times Square on WHC road. The fifth youth wasn’t with them. It is believed he might have gone from Amravati road gate where there is no CCTV coverage.There are two entrances into the building. One is from front while other one is fire staircase from rear side. It is not clear which one the youths took. Sitabuldi police said two plastic drums smelling of some fuel were also found from fourth floor. While entering the building, the youths had nothing in their hands.Laxmi Nagar resident Chhabra (26) told TOI he had no enmity with anyone so no suspecion over any person. “We had no insurance. I with my partner- Pawan Nirbhan- were about to start the bar and restaurant in the next few days. Labourers of contractors used to stay there but on Sunday none was there,” he said."

PUNE: Since the year began, as many as 26 cases of arson were registered in the city. Police data revealed that youngsters were involved in most of the cases, among which seven happened to be minors.On July 9, around 28 vehicles were torched in a Parvati slum making it the most grave incident since January, besides similar cases of vehicles being set ablaze in the city.According to the data, maximum number of cases have been registered under Sangvi police station, while Division IV remained the most notorious area (see box) where such cases were registered in almost all police stations.As per senior police officials, such acts were mostly committed by people under the influence of alcohol. While police admits that it is difficult to prevent such crimes, their frequent occurrence has exposed the vulnerability of lakhs of vehicles parked along the roadside every night.The CCTV surveillance network has helped the police solve most of these cases this year. Police arrested seven juveniles involved in the crime, while three of the accused are already behind the bars.Among the arrested persons, most turned out to be youngsters, said Deepak Sakore, deputy commissioner of police in-charge of Zone IV. “The crimes are motivated by revenge or rivalry. But, if one vehicle catches fire, all those in the vicinity are brought into its fold. Interestingly, we have not seen any repeat offenders of such crimes,” he said, explaining that most cases have been reported from congested residential colonies of middle-class and lower middle-class families.Police commissioner Rashmi Shukla has appealed the citizens to share information and leads to unravel the pending cases too. “We are trying out some strategies to prevent such offences. However, citizens must come forward to report any information that they may be related to the crimes,” she said."

INDORE: Mandsaur police has identified more than 30 drug smugglers who indulged in violence and arson during the farmers’ violence seen in the district during the first week of June.Mandsaur superintendent of police Manoj Kumar Singh has announced a reward of Rs 5000 each on the heads of as many as 32 persons for violence during the agitation on June 6 and 7. All of them have a history of drug smuggling in the opium rich district Madhya Pradesh.“We sifted through video grabs from various sources and have identified 30-32 drug smugglers who indulged in violence under the garb of farmers’ agitation,” Singh told TOI.Every person thus identified had been booked in the past under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. Their photographs are in police records.“We have arrested around four persons. The rest seem to have fled the district. We have launched a manhunt,” the SP said.Violence broke out in Mandsaur leading to deaths of six persons, five of them in firing in Pipliamandi. The agitated crowd had set afire as many as 30 vehicles, besides torching four shops and two factories. The violent mob had looted liquor shops and toll collection booth at Pipliamandi.Police had arrested over 100 persons in connection to violence and had launched a full-scale investigation into it, once normalcy returned to the district.The police sniffed the role of smugglers in violence when it came to fore that one of those killed in firing at Pipliamandi had four cases registered against him under NDPS Act and was evading police.Mandsaur district produces two-thirds of country’s opium under the watchful eyes of authorities. The bumper crop of opium has often provided raw material for drug smugglers, who have been operational in the region and have been caught by the police in the past.The move by the police gave a new dimension to the cause of violence in the area, raising speculations if the violence during farmers’ protest was stage-managed.Former Mandsaur district collector Swantra Kumar Singh was also manhandled by a crowd and made to run to safety on the violence stretch of Neemuch highway on June 6. Police have booked around 40 persons in connection to the attack.“We have identified 4-5 persons and named them in the FIR filed regarding the attack on the former collector.

The protest turned violent as they set 10 vehicles on fire. Over 25 people were injured.The police have prepared a list of 135 accused who injured 12 policemen and damaged property worth Rs 1.55 crore. The police said out of the 135, they have arrested 30. This includes 10 villagers arrested on Monday — nine of them arrested by Manpada police in Dombivli while one person was arrested by Hill Line police. The police are planning to invoke stringent charges against those who used petrol bombs and bamboos and pelted stones ayt police.Meanwhile, as a result of the constant surveillance, the villagers are scared of police ire. A resident from Bhal village said, ""In the name of arresting suspects, police are harassing villagers. Now everybody is scared that police may falsely implicate anybody to take revenge of the attack on their personnel.”"

He was detained under section 151 (arrest to prevent the commission of cognizable offences) and 107 (security for keeping the peace in other cases) of CrPC. These are bailable sections, and police can grant bail without producing the accused before a court.“A police officer in the rank of a DCP can grant bail. These sections are used only to detain a person as a preventive measure,” a lawyer who practises at the Gurugram court said, adding that under these sections, an accused can apply for bail before the police. Police commissioner Sandeep Khirwar confirmed that Amu was released, but he would be asked to join the probe into the violence that broke out ahead of the release of the film. “Let him join the investigations first and further action will follow accordingly,” said Khirwar.According to police, the probe into the case registered at Bhondsi police station after a mob torched a Haryana Roadways bus and attacked a school bus has revealed that Amu, also a former Haryana BJP leader, was complicit in instigating the violence in several speeches he had made on television channels and in public. Amu has been charged under Section 120B (criminal conspiracy) of IPC.Fifty-year-old Amu was referred to PGIMS, Rohtak on Monday after he complained of chest pain. He was lodged in Bhondsi jail. According to sources, he was rushed to the emergency ward of Gurugram’s Civil hospital late on Sunday, but was shifted to PGIMS later for an angiogram. He was brought back to the jail on Tueday.The Karni Sena leader was arrested after police sensed that he could give instigating speeches to make situation worse in Gurugram. According to sources, he had been making statements in media which caught the attention of police. On Thursday morning, he had announced that he would visit cinema halls and distribute flowers to film-goers. However, he was warned against this by police.

CHANDIGARH: Even over 15 months after violence and arson gripped Haryana during the February 2016 proquota Jat stir , over 163 weapons and ammunition looted by rioters, are yet to be recovered.These weapons were stolen, snatched or looted during the violence, in which 31 people were killed and public and private property worth crores of rupees was damaged.Security experts and retired police officers are of the view that not only could such a large number of arms and ammunition be misused for anti-social activities, but their non-recovery after such a long period reflects poorly on the police force.The data on weapons not yet recovered by cops was recently submitted before Justice S N Jha panel, which is probing the conspiracy angle in the violence.According to the data, in Rohtak alone -the epicenter of the agitation -around 104 weapons of private persons deposited at Meham police station and a local gun house were looted and are yet to be recovered. These weapons include single and do uble-barrel guns, pistols and revolvers. Surprisingly, three .303 rifles along with 75 rounds, looted from the police guard room outside finance minister Captain Abhimanyu's residence, have also not been traced by the police. This, despite the arrest of 40 persons in cases related to attack on the minister's residence.Around 53 weapons, including 31 private ones, 19 case property and 3 official arms, looted from Jind district's Pillu Khera police station, too have not been recovered till date. Even the tear grenades, pistols and shells that were snatched from the state police at national highway-1, near Larsauli village in Sonipat district, as violence spiralled, are yet to be found. Police also have no clues on the the 2300 missing cartridges.Retired Inspector General of Police (IGP) Ranbir Sharma, said non-recovery of such a huge cache of ammunition even after more than a year of investigation and identification of several accused, reflects the insensitivity of the police and the state government. “It also shows that the police and authorities are not serious about recovery of weapons, which could be misused by anti-social elements,“ he added.Former director general of police (DGP), M S Malik said such arms are likely to be used by criminals.“Since these are legally purchased sophisticated guns and pistols of private individuals deposited at gun houses or police stations, such weaponry is serious threat to social security of the state."""

The arrested man, Keshav Kakkad (25), was handed over to the police in Delhi on Monday. Kakkad admitted the crime after his arrest, said the police.

The crime branch unit 8 led by inspectors P Waval and Sunil Mane acted on a tip-off to catch Kakkad from his girlfriend’s residence on Sunday evening.

The police said Kakkad and his lover, a small-time film actor, flew to the city on Wednesday last week, the day of the crime.

Kakkad, who has several offences of extortion, murder and attempt to murder lodged against him in Delhi, set the garment shop in Karol Bagh market on fire because his large monetary demand was refused, said the police.

Shopkeepers in the vicinity had some time ago filed a complaint that Kakkad was harassing them to extort money.

“On the fateful day, the accused, who is well-built, barged into shop owner Rakesh Thakur’s shop and demanded money, and when he was refused he poured petrol and set the shop on fire,” inspector Waval said. “The shop was gutted, causing huge loss of property.”

Six fire engines and water tankers were rushed to douse the fire. A 74-year-old woman on the staff of Thakur’s store, Mathura Devi, died of burn injuries and Thakur himself received 80% burns. Thakur’s condition was said to be critical."

Government Medical College is in news again, for all the wrong reasons. Recently, an unidentified miscreant set a couple of bikes ablaze at girls’ hostels in the wee hours. This is second such incident within a year. But it seems the authorities have not learnt their lesson. The arson attack, captured on the CCTV camera, has not only instilled immense fear among the girls , it has also raised questions about college’s poor security measures. Angry students have now approached the PM to seek better security measures for themselves.Medical aspirants from all over the country vie to get a seat in GMC. But today, the students studying here are angry and scared due to such harrowing incidents happening too often on the campus premises. One of the hostel girls who is still in shock, shares, “We are so scared that none of us are able to study or sleep properly since that incident. Our parents are also quite worried about our safety. GMC is one of the leading medical institutions in the country, but it is sad to know that it is so vulnerable to such lethal attacks.”After the incident, over 200 students staged a protest in front of the dean, Dr Abhimanyu Niswade’s office. Another hostel girl requesting anonymity laments, “Enough is enough! We want our demands to be met now. We need a boundary wall immediately. What if our hostels are set on fire tomorrow? Forget an adequate number of security guards, the hostels do not even have an emergency exit.” Quite irked, she goes on to add, “When our two-wheelers were torched, the security guard was fast asleep and we had to wake him up. The girls had to douse the fire, using fire extinguishers and the guard was simply watching. I fail to understand why can’t the authorities work seriously towards beefing up the security?”It is not just the girls, who are fighting for their safety, college boys have also joined the bandwagon to support them. One of the residents of boys’ hostel says that there are many other grave issues bothering the GMC girls. He adds, “Girls being eve-teased by the outsiders on the premises has become a regular feature here. We have submitted a full report of all our problems to the dean.” To this, another student adds, “Last time too, the dean had promised to build the boundary wall and now he has promised to do it all over again, but if we do not see any development on this front, nothing will stop us from going on strike again.”Not ready to take things lying down, GMC students have now shared their woes with the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on social media. One of the hostel residents reveals, “It is important to bring this issue to their notice. Over 100 students have tweeted to both CM and PM, expressing their anger and concern. We want to expose the incompetency of the security agencies and callous attitude of the college authorities.”"

CHENNAI: Protests erupted at Sathyabama University on Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR) on Wednesday night after an 18-year-old first year computer science student committed suicide in her hostel after being caught copying in an exam, police said. After dinner, as the news spread, several students torched furniture at the college and the hostel. A police team conducted an inquiry but no one was arrested.Police identified the deceased as Duvvuru Monica Reddy of Andhra Pradesh and said she was writing the chemistry paper in her semester exam when she was found copying. The invigilator informed other officials and she was asked to leave the hall,” a police officer said.A university official told TOI that the girl was caught copying from a 10x12 paper. The usual consequence of such examination-related malpractice is that the student would be debarred for one examination and the family intimated. The girl went back to her hostel, and apparently sent an SMS to her twin Rakesh who was also writing the examination in the same hall.Her brother saw the text message only after the examination, rushed to her hostel and requested her friends to check her room. Monica Reddy was found hanging and rushed to hospital, where she was declared dead.The university official said there was no unrest on campus till dinner time and that students had taken their food and evening snacks in the mess without any trouble. It is not clear if the death has any direct link to the late evening campus unrest and arson committed by students, he said, adding that university authorities would think about future course of action, including declaring leave, by Thursday.The parents of the victim are on their way from Hyderabad, police said.After this incident, the university has postponed the pending exams to January, 2018. Also, originally the holidays were scheduled from December 2 to January 2 but now, they have declared the holidays from today till January 2.In Video: Girl commits suicide, fellow students set college library on fire"

AHMEDABAD: Patidar quota stir leader Hardik Patel on Tuesday sought anticipatory bail from the city sessions court in connection with the FIR lodged with Ramol police on charges of rioting and arson against him and 59 other agitators.As the probe has been transferred to the city crime branch, Patel, on Monday, went along with 12 other supporters to surrender in this case. However, he was not arrested because the investigating officer was out of station. In his bail plea filed through advocate Rafik Lokhandwala, Patel has contended that police does not want to arrest him at present, but he fears that he could be arrested at a crucial time when he undertakes a movement. It has also been contended that if he is arrested now, he may go to an appropriate court for bail proceedings. But since, police seem intent on disrupting his future programme, they may apprehend him. The court issued notice to the investigating officer and kept March 31 for hearing on the anticipatory bail plea."

MUMBAI: Fire brigade officials suspects the recent fire at Garib Nagar in Bandra during a demolition drive was arson and not an accident. Officials are waiting for cops to complete investigation and submit a report.Fire officials said their initial reports show the blaze was not caused by a short-circuit or a gas leak. They suspect someone set ablaze a shanty using kerosene, causing the fire to spread quickly and several cylinders in the vicinity to explode. Chief fire officer P Rahangdale said, “After an initial probe, we suspect it was not an accidental fire. Since the police are also investigating the case, we are waiting for their panchnama and other reports to conclude our report.”A fire erupted last month while the BMC was clearing slum encroachments adjoining the Tansa water pipeline near Bandra station (E). Three firemen sustained injuries during the fire-fighting operation. The police have arrested a 29-year-old man on charges of arson. According to the police, the accused, Sadir Khan, and a few others added to the fire, which eventually engulfed around 300 hutments and left the firemen injured. Local slumlord Salim Lightwalla and his son Salman, who are accused in the case, are absconding. The duo is also accused in the Azad Maidan riots case.The slum stands on encroached land adjoining the Bandra station foot over-bridge. Part of the land is owned by railway and portion of it is with the BMC. Civic officials said most of the shanties are illegal and around two decades ago, the BMC had removed them from the area after providing them alternate accommodation at various locations. But several returned again and constructed multistorey slum structures."

BENGALURU: Tension prevailed in the villages around Darshankuli forest , where a Doddalahalli youth was killed on Thursday. Forest officials said that Gurumurthy Siddaiah alias Guru was a poacher, who died after being hit by a bullet fired by one of his associates. However, villagers alleged it was an encounter, and took to attacking forest and police department vehicles, even indulging in arson.The villagers said that Guru was a farmer, and not a poacher. “His mother Thayamma is a milk farmner, and owns many cows. One of them didn’t return home on Wednesday. So Guru and three of his friends went into the forest in search of the cow,” said Mahesh Guraiah, a Doddalahalli resident.However, Guraiah said that he did not know anything about Guru’s friends. News of Guru’s death spread like wildfire and by noon, hundreds of villagers descended on Uyamballi, on the periphery of Darshakakuli forest. The presence of cops notwithstanding, the villagers raised slogans against forest officials. A group of men even tried to upend a police jeep, but senior officials prevented them.The mob of villagers demanded that forest officials who fired at Guru be handed over to them. Later, the villagers refused to allow Guru’s body to be taken for autopsy until the government announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh.Meanwhile, some miscreants set vehicles parked outside the forest office on fire, and hurled stones at the windows. The front portion of the office was gutted by the fire.Ramanagara SP Ramesh Banoth , along with the forest officials succeeded in pacifying the mob. “We told them compensation was not in our hands. We can recommend it if it is found that the deceased youth was not a poacher, and the forest officials are proven wrong,” a senior forest official said."

CHENNAI: As Cauvery sentiments simmered, there was some semblance of calm in Tamil Nadu on Tuesday with just sporadic reports of unrest and arson. While undercurrent of tension remained in some parts of the state, members of fringe Tamil groups targeted Karnataka registration vehicles and establishments.In Sriperumbudur near Chennai, a mob attacked and torched a truck bearing Karnataka registration. Villagers doused the flames throwing buckets of water and sand. Police stepped up security for Karnataka-based establishments as minor incidents of stone throwing at buses and ATMs continued. Police provided protection to residences of actors Rajnikant, Prabhu Deva, Prakash Raj and Arjun in Chennai.A private bus carrying 11 passengers and proceeding from Koyambedu towards Bengaluru were intercepted by two men on a motorbike. They were later arrested. On Tuesday morning, seven people entered a Karnataka-based hotel 'Sangeetha' situated in Gandhi Nagar in Velachery and raised slogans condemning the attack on Tamils in Bengaluru. They allegedly damaged window panes by hurling stones.Some men torched a truck bearing Karnataka registration in Karur at midnight of Monday. Fearing further violence, police strengthened security in front of Karnataka banks and the state bank of Mysore in many places in the central region.A coffee powder shop at Kaveri Nagar in Thanjavur was ransacked by miscreants on Tuesday. The shop was a franchise of a coffee manufacturing unit said to be owned by a senior political leader of Karnataka.With the Cauvery row making it difficult for trucks carrying vegetables from Tamil Nadu to enter Karnataka, the TN government decided to procure the produce from farmers of Krishnagiri and Dharmapuri and sell the goods in farm fresh outlets.About 12 metric tonnes of vegetables were procured from farmers on Tuesday, said an official statement. The vegetables from Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri would be sold in 64 farm fresh outlets in Chennai, Trichy, Madurai, and Coimbatore districts. These outlets are run by Kamadhenu, Chintamani, Kancheepuram, and North Madras Cooperative stores, and TN civil supplies corporation."

Gurgaon: For the second time in a week, a fire broke out in an Aravali forest area, this time in the Ghata area on Wednesday afternoon. It spread over nearly seven acres before it could be put out.More than half-a-dozen fire tenders from DLF Phase 5 and Sector 29 fire stations were pressed into service. The fire was doused after two hours.On April 14, a fire was reported in Aravali forest at Titdali village near Badshapur. The affected area is part of the Aravali foothills covered with tall grass and old trees, and marked in land revenue records as ‘gair mumkin pahar' and ‘bhood', earmarked for a potential NCZ. The land is owned by a developer.Although authorities were unable to pinpoint the cause of the fire, sources said it could have been man-made. ""The fire could have been lit by someone to clear the greenery, as getting permission to cut trees here is difficult,"" said a source, adding the ""arsonist"" could have been driven by the hope this would lead to faster clearance for the NCZ project.The department of town and country planning is currently processing the NCZ proposal.During a visit to Gurgaon last week, DTCP additional chief secretary P Raghvendra Rao had said, ""The district-level committee has submitted its report. We'll finalise the NCZ soon.""The chief conservator of forest (Gurgaon circle) M D Sinha, said the affected area does not come under his department's jurisdiction. ""Even though the land is privately owned, forest personnel reached the spot and helped douse the fire,"" he said.He dismissed possibility of short circuit, saying there is no high tension wire passing through the area. ""It's difficult to say what caused the fire,"" said Sinha.Firefighter Pawan Kumar said the hilly terrain posed some challenges before they could douse the fire."

Racism and hate crime are becoming an increasingly common occurrence for di asporic communities and ethnic minorities living in the US of late. Attacks on houses of worship after the elevation of Donald Trump as US president are adding to the tension among the Punjabi diaspora. To combat this, the Sikh Coalition has brought out some guidelines on `Preventing Attacks on Gurdwaras'.The steps in the `Gurdwara Security Toolkit' which are being distributed to gurdwaras around the US, and can also be downloaded online. These include keeping a `Clean House', ensuring no rubbish or leaves are left around the gurdwara as fuel for arsonists. A voluntary Community Arson Watch Programme is also encouraged, alongside establishing links with the police and fire department. Indeed, steps to combat arson such as installing sprinklers, smoke alarms, lights, and locks are extensively covered due to an average of 103 arson fires per year being reported in 2000-2015 at houses of worship. Less than 2% were initially investigated as hate crimes.The guidelines also outline a number of potential types of attacks houses of worship could encounter; shootersmall arms attack involving hostages, vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices, arson, sabotage theftvandalism, chemicalbiologi calradiological attacks.Potential indicators of attack are also listed, such as someone wearing bulky clothing, or people asking excessive questions regarding the tem ple's practices or infrastructure. Protective measures are discussed thoroughly, and instructions on how to respond should a shooter be in the vicinity are provided. Tips on how and where to run and hide are given as steps 1 and 2, and step 3 which is fight, suggested as the last resort.Aasees Kaur of the Sikh Coalition explains why now seemed the right time for this initiative. “Five years ago, the Sikh community in America witnessed the Oak Creek tragedy.Since then, as hate crime has continued against Sikhs, we have also witnessed a significant spike in hate crime against minority communities over the past year. There are many reports of vandalism, arson, bomb threats, and mass shootings targeting places of worship. While we refuse to live in fear, we do not want to see our gurdwaras vandalized or attacked. Our goal with this project is to take appropriate measures to protect and defend our places of worship, communities and children“.She stresses that Tracking these guidelines adDiasp dress both gurdwara committee members and the Sangat.“Gurdwara committees have a duty to take preventative measures to better protect their congregation and the local Sangat feel it's right to encourage their committee members to commit to this programme if they have not done so already . It's great to see this happening with this project“.So far, the vast majority of gurdwaras have responded positively, and the Sikh Coalition has connected them with local federal security experts, who in turn have been getting to know the community members. While this is limited to the US as yet, Kaur feels that this kind of initiative may find its way into other Punjabi diaspora communities in the UK or Canada."

JAIPUR: The Banjaras of Dhikola in Bhilwara district heaved a sigh of relief as the sessions court in Shahpura refused to allow the government to withdraw the FIR registered in the August 2014 case of arson against a mob that attacked the homes of 42 Banjara families in Dhikola, Bhilwara district. On November 23 last year, the principal secretary in the home department of the state government had sought that in “public interest”, this FIR be withdrawn. Activists were riled, and questioned whose “interests” the government upheld –of victims or perpetrators of crime.On August 19, 2014, in an unprovoked attack, a mob armed with sharp weapons poured kerosene on the possessions and homes of 42 families of the traditionally nomadic Banjara community at Dhikola in Shahpura gram panchayat of Bhilwara district. Motorcycles and tractors were reduced to cinders and homes turned into ash. The FIR was registered under sections pertaining to rioting and carrying deadly weapons. There were 141 accused and 46 were arrested.On Friday, arguing against the withdrawal of the FIR by the government, Suresh Srimali , lawyer of the Banjaras, said the charges were grave. Withdrawal of the FIR would be a bolt to the justice delivery mechanism of the state, he said. The court refused to allow the government to withdraw FIR and posted the matter for hearing on August 4.Paras Banjara, the only graduate from the community, said this represented a victory for his people. “Despite our urging, the government refused to review its decision to withdraw the FIR. We are glad the court listened to our plea. The Banjaras are a people with faith in the Constitution and the judiciary. We will continue to struggle for justice.”"

ROHTAK: Two accused Ajay and Sachin, who were booked for arson and looting a Woodland showroom and a liquor vend in Rohtak during 2016 February violence were acquitted by a local court on Friday for want of evidence. It was on the complaint of Kunal, manager of Woodland showroom at D-park in Rohtak, that a case was registered on February 25, 2016, under sections 436, 392, 148 and 149 of the IPC.The complainant had stated that many persons armed with sharp-edged weapons and sticks had barged into the showroom on February 19 and looted footwear worth Rs 46 lakh and garments and accessories worth more than Rs 1.05 crore. They also torched furniture causing losses of Rs 40 lakh before fleeing.Another FIR was registered on the same day by a Model Town chowki constable that the looted items had been stored in a shop near D-park. When the police raided it in the presence of the shop owner, they recovered Woodland apparels and liquor bottles from there. Shop owner Surender had claimed that he had rented the shop to Ajay and his friend Manjeet Yadav for four months and suspected their role in this.Manjeet turned out to be a son of a personal security officer of a Rohtak BJP MLA and minister Manish Grover while Ajay was a son of a local cop.After investigations, name of Sachin of Chhara village name was also added in the FIR and subsequently Ajay and Sachin were arrested. Later, a chargesheet was filed against both but there was no mention of Manjeet, son of Grover’s PSO Davinder Yadav.Pronouncing the judgment, additional district judge Jasbir Singh acquitted both, who were already out on bail.This has brought the investigations by the police under scanner. Witnesses in the court stated that the shop, where the looted items were stored, was found unlocked while the police had claimed that it was locked. In the court the shop owner denied his statement that he had leased out his property to the accused. Moreover, the police had claimed that they had called up the showroom owner and complainant at the shop but the latter stated that he was shown the looted items in the police station and was not called at the spot. Besides, the cops did not seal the case property.The police had registered 1,212 cases against 305 persons in Rohtak for the violence during Jat stir."

KOLKATA: The Bhangar violence seems to be the Vedic Village arson throwback, when an angry mob had set the resort on fire eight years back in 2009. Beneath the immediate reason -a clash over an innocuous football match in which a youth was killed -lay a mega plan of the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government to purchase 1600 acres of land for an IT township in the area through private promoter -Vedic Realty -of which 90 acres were to be handed over to IT majors Wipro and Infosys for setting up their projects. Unlike Singur and Nandigram, this was a private venture. But the effect was no different. Bhattacharjee had to scrap the project days after the violence.The Bhangar land purchase, though on a much lower scale -only 16 acres and that too for the Power Grid Corporation (POWERGRID) project -has once again put a question mark on how sound is the policy of purchasing multi-crop land even though the Mamata Banerjee government has a land-neutral policy .The fact of the matter at ground zero remains the same. Like Gaffar Mollah and Ruidas Mandal in the Vedic Realty case, Trinamool leader Arabul Islam and his team have a role in the Bhangar violence. Trinamool minister and local MLA Abdur Rezzak Molla stoked the fire by making a provocative comment over fertility of the villagers in a public meeting in the area few days back. While Arabul-loyalists maintain that the minister did it deliberately to muddy the waters, Molla suppor ters argue that the damage was done much before the MLA joined Trinamool in 2016.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who is sensitive over the land question initially, tweeted on Tuesday that the project will be shifted elsewhere if locals do not want it there, and later retracted possibly having a second thought on whether the state government has the authority to make such an announcement on its own. The dilemma has given ammunition to the Opposition. CPM state secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra wanted the CM to make the scarp announcement at Bhangar like her predecessor had done at Nandigram. However, Mishra's demand has little impact in Bhangar because locals suffered similarly in Rajarhat, Ma hisgoth, Mahisbathan areas during the CPM rule.CPM leaders are thus giving support to the movement from behind lest the movement gets spoiled in the political wrangle.But why did the villagers chose to fight now when the POWERGRID project is towards completion? Bhangar seems to be the flashpoint of all earlier land aggregations in the vicinity , and not just a rebuff to the POWERGRID project. It calls into question what the authorities told the village folk for all these years and what has happened on the ground. It also throws light on how the land was “purchased“ with the help of ruling partymen. For instance, the POWERGRID notification on October 22, 2016, states that project will benefit mostly the Bhangar, Rajarhat area and large tracts of North and South 24-Parganas. Villagers want to know how. They want to know how the powerhouse wastes will be discharged. Finally , it has brought to the fore if the new development model unlike the forcible acquisition in Singur leaves any scope for refusing land for the project.Add to this the lack of clarity over compensation rates. All these reflect a disconnect or mistrust among villagers making them prone to rumour on other environmental concerns. A POWERGRID press release says that the project is imporatant for power supply in Kolkata and Rajarhat apart from other areas. “This substation is created with a State-of-the-Art Gas Insulated Switchgear (GIS) Technology , which requires about 14th of the land as compared to conventional substation. GIS technology is safe, reliable and requires less maintenance,“ the press release claims .What's more is the perception among villagers that authorities tweaked the original alignment of the 400 KV transmission lines to accommodate the upcoming real estate projects coming up near Vedic Village at Uttar Gazipur, Chandipur flanked by VIP Road, Jessore Road at the Rajarhat end, and instead being run over the multi-crop agricultural lands under heavy police presence.Bhangar, like Nandigram, has a substantial Muslim population among whom Trinamool has a solid support base. A section among Trinamool has active participation in the land stir like CPM supporters had during the Nandigram movement.Mamata isn't thus taking it lightly ."

NAGPUR: Deputy commander of Kasansur dalam Jyoti Gawade was shot dead by Gadchiroli district police’s C-60 commandos at Botejhari and Badgaon forest on Thursday. She is alleged to be the architect of the state’s worst Naxalite arson attack which took place at Surjagarh on December 23 last year. 76 trucks, 3 JCBs and 1 motorcycles were burnt by the rebels.Intelligence agencies have claimed that Jyoti had shifted to the north of Gadchiroli in the last fortnight to evade police. Shivaji Bodkhe, IG of state anti-naxal operations (ANO), said that Jyoti was trying to break through the police cordon when she received bullet injuries in retaliatory fire. “Police have also seized Jyoti’s .303 rifle,” he added.Police said Jyoti was trying to contact her family at Botejhari village when the police swooped down on her. On Wednesday, the police had cornered Naxals at Nihalkai forest near Gyarapatti from where two .12 bore rifles were seized. After intensifying the search operations, the police spotted Jyoti’s dalams following which a battled ensued.Jyoti, alias Sagobai Narsingh, was earlier commander of Surjagarh local guerrilla squad (LGS) which was later amalgamated with Kasansur dalam. Senior Naxal cadres had killed Jyoti’s husband, Diwakar who was a popular and seasoned leader of Tippagarh, in cold blood around four years ago.After Diwakar’s murder, Jyoti was shifted to south Gadchiroli where she later was elevated to the rank of commander of Surjagarh LGS.Gadchiroli SP Abhinav Deshmukh said that verifications are under way for “collecting concrete evidence” of Jyoti’s presence at the arson site.The police had claimed that Kasansur dalam was present during the arson attack. Jyoti was its second-in-command after commander Mahesh Gota and divisional committee member Surjan Akka. The other dalams present at site were Perimili, Gatta local organization squads (LOS) and Bhamragarh.Police claim that mine workers had said about the presence of a woman leading the Naxal attack. There were other women in the group too. The other leaders who are likely to have participated in the arson are commander Sainath of Perimili dalam, Dinesh of Bhamragarh dalam and Ramco of Gatta LOS."

Ahmedabad: The SIT court rejected allegations of gang rape during the Gulbarg Society massacre on the ground that it is difficult to think of rapes occurring at a place where a huge mob was indulging in stone-hurling, throwing burning rags and trying to burn a house.D e signated judge PB Desai exonerated three convicts - Yogendra Shekhawat, Lakhansinh Chudasama and Dinesh Sharma - of the charge of raping two women.The court said that two of the convicts - Chudasama and Sharma - were arrested seven years after the incident and there was no forensic or medical evidence to prove that they ra p ed anyone.""No doubt, attempts must have been made to molest or outrage the modesty of women by ripping open their clothes but allegations of rape appear to have been an afterthought,"" the court said."

CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court has held that release of the main accused, who was leading the mob that had set Haryana finance minister Captain Abhimanyu Singh ’s house on fire in Rohtak during Jat violence, may lead to “tampering” of prosecution witnesses.The matter is being investigated by the CBI after the Haryana government had handed over the case to the premier investigation agency in August.The court passed these orders while dismissing the bail plea of Dilawar Singh, an ex-serviceman who is behind bars since February when the state had witnessed violence during the Jat stir.“Prima facie, the petitioner was the leader of the mob that indulged in arson, loot and burning of the house of Captain Abhimanyu. The offences are serious and there is every likelihood of tampering prosecution witnesses if the petitioner is released on bail. In that view of the matter, the prayer for grant of regular bail to the petitioner is rejected,” stated Justice A B Chaudhari in his order released on Tuesday.Justice Chaudhari further observed that the inmates of the house had to take shelter somewhere else as the entire kothi was burnt. “The petitioner was seen as the leader of the mob in setting on fire and entering the premises . It is not in dispute that there was order under Section 144 of the CrPC at that time. There is, thus, ample evidence against the petitioner and in no case he can be released on bail in the wake of such evidence that of eyewitnesses,” the court said.Dilawar Singh had approached the HC seeking bail on the ground that the matter had been taken over by the CBI that might take its time for investigation. He further submitted that there was no offence against him nor any recovery has been made from him and as such, he ought to be released on bail as he had been behind bars for over nine months.Opposing the bail, the state argued that two eyewitnesses — Naveen Dhull and Ram Niwas Hooda — have named Dilawar in person who was seen performing the overt act when the building was being set on fire.Dilawar, however, argued that the statements were recorded in March 2016, two months after the incident and, therefore, no importance could be given to those statements. Dilawar Singh had taken voluntary retirement from the Air Force and returned to Haryana in February and immediately after that he was arrested for his alleged involvement in the incident."

NEW DELHI: The arson attacks on schools in Kashmir are seen by the central security establishment as an attempt by local mischief mongers and separatists to keep the “fires burning”, now that the protests over the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist Burhan Wani have died down.Sources in the intelligence agencies told TOI on Tuesday that nearly 80% of the schools attacked over the past three to four months were set on fire after Eid ul Adha on September 12. “By that time, the violent stone-pelting agitations had largely been brought under control. So, the trouble-makers changed their strategy and started targeting schools. This way they could deny that normalcy was back in the Valley,” said an intelligence operative.According to a senior IPS officer, by instigating local youth to set schools on fire, those orchestrating violence in the Valley since July aimed to keep the authorities “engaged”. A J&K police officer said the arsonists, as evident from the profile of those arrested so far, are mostly uneducated and unemployed youth blindly following directions of local separatists. They may also be getting paid by “agents”.The motive behind targeting schools goes beyond just creating unrest. Schools in Kashmir close for vacations in the winter, and are used to accommodate the security forces. “The idea is to deny the forces logistics for their stay,” said an officer. Also, given that most of the schools targeted are modern educational institutions, the agencies suspect a “radical” agenda.An intelligence officer told TOI that though their crackdown on separatist elements and local mischief mongers in September-October had managed to break the cycle of violence in the Valley, the reluctance of the state government of late to persist with arrests and raids may have given the trouble-makers a breather to bounce back.“We suspect local Jamaate-Islami leaders as being behind the school attacks. Some local boys have been identified and arrested. But certain big names in south Kashmir still roam free,” the officer conceded.Officials feel there is a silver lining to the targeted attacks on schools in the Valley. “The civil society elements who were, until now, unwilling to take a stand against the separatists and the lead trouble-makers, are now coming out to condemn the burning of educational institutions,” said a police officer."

PUNE: Rakesh Kadam was among those whose motorcycle was gutted in Sunday's incident in which a drunken man set fire to 30 vehicles.In the incident, a threewheeler tempo pickup, 27 motorcycles and two bicycles were destroyed.Add to their woes, few vehicles that were destroyed had insurance cover.The police are still ascertaining the motive, but Kadam believes the suspect, Jabya Hari Patil (25) aka Nilesh, was out to steal fuel from the parked vehicles. Kadam told TOI that he and a few others had checked the fuel pipes of other vehicles and found them tampered with. “Patil may have tried to steal petrol, and then set the vehicles on fire,“ Kadam said.Kadam further added that the area where he lives -Janata Vasahat slums -is plagued by fuel thefts. “We do not have proper parking space here. Nor can we can park out vehicles in front of our houses. Because of this, we park vehicles along the main road,“ Kadam said, “Miscreants take advantage of this and steal petrol.“A crime branch officer admitted fuel thefts were a menace. “The Janata Vasahat residents never fill petrol in their vehicles' tanks while returning home at night. This was a blessing. Had the fuel tanks been full on Sunday morning, the fire could have engulfed a higher number of vehicles,“ the officer said.How he was heldSub-inspector Anil Dap hal of Dattawadi police, who is probing the case, said the suspect was arrested on a tipoff. Patil stays on Lane No. 38, which was located exactly opposite the public toilet, which was the crime scene. “A few witnesses had seen Patil near the spot minutes before the fire broke out,“ Daphal said.A police team led by se nior inspector Anil Patil and comprising constables Anil More, Abhijit Kalaskar and Ashok Hirwale , tracked Patil down to near the vicinity of his home and nabbed him.“During questioning, Patil confessed that he had set the vehicles on fire,“ Daphal said. According to Daphal, Pa til who works at a private company , got his salary on Saturday. “He had spent his salary on liquor and returned home drunk in the early hours of Sunday. We will question him further after getting police custody from the court,“ Daphal said."

BENGALURU: It was a trivial argument that 24-year-old Shiva Kumar and his two brothers could have let go.But they decided to teach the opposite party a lesson by burning a scooter belonging to them. This has landed Kumar behind bars, while his two brothers and a friend who helped them commit the crime are on the run.Kumar, a resident of Sanjay Nagar, along with his brothers Srinivas and Naveen , sells vegetables at K R Puram vegetable market.They had a bone to pick with two brothers who were frequent visitors to the market. The brothers, residents of Diesel Shed Road, would berate the trio for selling low quality vegetables for higher prices. They complained the vegetables were having an adverse effect on anyone consuming them.This was detrimental to the trio’s business and they decided to teach the brothers a lesson they would never forget.They followed the victim and found out where they stayed.“The accused initially hatched a plot to harm the victims, but later backed out fearing arrest. They then decided to destroy the property belonging to the victims. In the wee hours of Sunday, Kumar along with his two brothers and another friend Kantharaju, of K R Puram, lifted the Honda Dio scooter belonging to the wife of one of the victims. After forcibly breaking open its handle lock, the accused pushed it towards Gangashetty lake, which is a few kilometers away from the victims’ residence. After drawing out petrol from the scooter, they poured it on the vehicle and torched it,” said an officer who is part of the investigations.In the morning, the victims woke up and took their scooter for stolen.However, two days later, the victims saw the number plate of the scooter near the lake. Suspecting foul play, they checked the area and found their scooter burnt and hidden inside the bushes. The family then filed a complaint with the jurisdictional K R Puram police who registered a case of mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to cause damage (IPC 435) and theft (IPC 379).“The victims initially didn’t suspect the vegetable vendors. But they remembered the recent quarrel they had with the vendors and revealed their names. When the police went to the market, the accused were not found. After collecting their address from other vendors, the police went to their house and were unable to find them even there. However on Thursday, the police were able to arrest Kumar when he was trying to go to his residence. However the other three are yet to be arrested. Kumar’s confession threw light on the reasons for their act,” the officer added.The accused has been remanded to judicial custody.

RAIPUR: With the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) indicting seven policemen for allegedly burning houses during a 2011 anti-Naxalite operation in Chhattisgarh 's Tadmetla, the confrontation between Bastar police on one hand and civil rights, social activists and Opposition parties on other has intensified.State's special police officers (SPOs)-turned assistant constables staged an unusual protest on the streets of Bastar on Monday evening while burning effigies of Delhi University professor Nandini Sundar, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and tribal activist Soni Sori, Communist Party of India (CPI) leader and former MLA Manish Kunjam, social activists Himanshu Kumar and Bela Bhatia apart from journalist Malini Subramanian because they have been moving courts and raising issues of human rights violations in the strife-torn region.Later, an unsigned press release from ""all assistant constables"" was given to the media through WhatsApp groups. The release said: ""The Maoists have killed thousands of tribals in Bastar and also create obstacles in development. The rebels do not believe in civil administration or judicial system and are also against democracy. We, the assistant constables, are local tribals and have joined the security forces to protect Bastar from the Naxalites. Nandini Sundar, Bela Bhatia, Himanshu Kumar, Soni Sori and Manish Kunjam are Maoist supporters, who thrive on the money from the Naxals."" The release added: ""Nandini Sundar has been visiting Bastar in the guise of a journalist to instigate people against the security forces.""""The Maoists had killed 76 security personnel at Tadmetla in April 2010. When the forces launched an operation at Tadmetla in 2011, activists presented wrong facts before the people and even in court,"" the release said.Though chief minister Raman Singh had made a statement that the matter would be inquired into and law will take its own course, the state government is yet to make its position public with regard to the CBI indicting policemen and the effigy burning protest by policemen.Activist Kumar wrote on Facebook: ""Its anarchy in Bastar. Such a protest by District Reserve Guards (DRG) under the leadership of inspector general of police (Bastar range) SRP Kalluri, is in fact a revolt against the state government."" He said that the forces comprising former SPOs are functioning like a 'gunda gang'. The activist also wrote on Facebook that lives of social activists, political party workers and journalists are in danger. ""Specifically, tribal activist and AAP leader Soni Sori besides her nephew are facing threats,"" he alleged.CPI veteran Chittaranjan Bakshi demanded suspension and arrest of Kalluri. ""Bastar IG said that whenever there is ""yudh' (war), there will fire and bombardment. Such remarks gives an impression that he is above the CBI and even Supreme Court"" the 84-year-old leader said.AAP's state secretary Nagesh Banchore said the burning of effigies is an attempt by the ruling BJP to divert public attention from CBI's indictment of policemen. ""Now, Raman Singh must make it clear when it approved or rejected the CBI's Tadmetla report,"" he said."

KOLKATA/DARJEELING: The Calcutta high court on Friday declared Gorkha Janmukti Morcha’s call for an indefinite Darjeeling bandh illegal, prompting the party to switch to track-two diplomacy and knock on Raj Bhavan’s doors for a tripartite meeting even as its cadres continued with their belligerence in the Hills Acting Chief Justice Nishita Mhatre passed the order on Friday, directing the Bengal government to ensure free movement in the Hills and provide adequate protection to tourists, students and Hills residents. She also asked the state to assess the quantum of damage to public property from the start of GJM’s lock-down on June 9 and submit a report by June-end. The damage during the 2013 GJM stir was estimated at Rs 69 crore.The court directed petitioner Ramaprasad Sarkar to serve notices to GJM leaders Bimal Gurung and Roshan Giri.The HC order had an immediate fallout as three GJM MLAs — Amar Rai, Sarita Rai and Rohit Sharma — approached Raj Bhavan, seeking a tripartite meeting with the Centre and the state.In the Hills, however, there was little evidence of any attempt at conciliation. The shutdown was near-total and the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway suspended operations indefinitely following the arson at Gayabari station. There was no violence in Darjeeling proper as GJM supporters also flexed muscles downhill in Kalimpong, Bijanbari, Mirik and Birpara in the Dooars. But GJM leaders denied their supporters were involved in arson.The GJM women’s wing staged a demonstration outside party president Bimal Gurung’s house and office in Patlewas, five km away, where police had carried out a raid on Thursday. Slogan-shouting women tried to march towards the party’s headquarters in Singmari but were stopped by a CRPF contingent.Reports of violence continued from late Thursday. The Gayabari incident was followed by suspected GJM supporters torching a primary health centre and bill payment office of the Lodhoma-Rimbick hydel power project, nearly 70 km from Darjeeling. In Mirik, which was declared a new sub-division recently by CM Mamata Banerjee, the Dora-I gram panchayat office was set ablaze.GJM supporters also tried to extend their outreach to the Terai and the Dooars regions. GJM supporters on Friday mobbed the Birpara police station in Dooars, following a secret meeting held at Jaigaon along the Indo-Bhutan border, sending alarm bells ringing at the neighbouring police stations of Chamurchi and Banarhat.The Centre and state governments stepped up the pressure on the GJM, with two columns of Army taking up position in front of the GJM party headquarters in Singmari, where GJM supporters had clashed with police on Thursday.Nothing, however, could bring life back to the Queen of the Hills. There was hardly any transport at the Chowrasta taxi stand, adding to the woes of students who came for the North Bengal University’s bachelors’ examinations.Police said they had tried to convince shopowners and other traders to open their establishments, but the latter said they were afraid.Meanwhile, Chhattisgarh chief minister and BJP leader Raman Singh visited West Midnapore on Friday and said the Bengal government could sort out the impasse in the Hills through dialogue. “People in the Hills, or those leading the agitation, may have some reasons for their anguish. The state government can redress the grievances by inviting them to talks,” said Singh."

DARJEELING: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha GJM ) has asked tourists to leave Darjeeling and warned those who stay on during its attempted lockdown of administrative offices and banks that they are doing so “at their own risk“.On Saturday night, five GJM supporters were arrested for the violence during the state cabinet meeting.“The situation is turning worse, and anything can happen. I appeal to them (tourists) to leave,“ GJM president Bimal Gurung said after a party meeting in Patleybas near Singamari on Sunday .Gurung's diktat, which is likely to hit the Hills economy and its residents harder than tourists, came after yet another signal from the Mamata Banerjee government that it intended to clamp down on the stir. “This is an extra-constitutional diktat, blatantly illegal. Gurung heads a legally mandated selfautonomous council; he isn't above the law himself,“ said state tourism minister Gautam Deb. Like the last three days, Sunday also saw a huge rush of tourists trying to get out of the Hills. “We had booked a hotel from Thursday to Sunday in Darjeeling, but because of the unrest we stayed in Kurseong,“ said a tourist."

Bhubaneswar: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) conducted a simulation exercise at Puri Railway Station on Sunday as part of its probe into the serial burning of three empty trains there November 12 last year.Prime accused Subhash Ramachandran, who is suspected to have links with a terror outfit, was taken to the station amid tight security where police reconstructed the sequence of events that led to burning of five coaches at different platforms. Railway police had a tough time to control crowd that gathered at the station to witness the mock drill.While NIA officials remained tightlipped about findings of the exercise, railway police said the motive behind the exercise was to ascertain how Ramachandran triggered the arson and whether other persons were involved in the serial fire.The mock exercise was conducted at the coaching depot where Ramachandran was asked to set fire to some seats using a chemical substance. The burnt remains were collected by the NIA for forensic test. On Monday, the NIA is likely to conduct a second round exercise to know whether Ramachandran took the assistance of others in the crime, said a railway police officer."

JAIPUR: The banjaras of Dhikola in Bhilwara heaved a sigh of relief as the sessions court in Shahpura refused to allow the government to withdraw the FIR registered in August 2014 case of arson against a mob that attacked the homes of 42 banjara families On November 23, 2016, the principal secretary in the home department of the state government had sought that in “public interest”, this FIR be withdrawn. Activists were riled, and questioned whose “interests” the government upheld –of victims or perpetrators of crime.On August 19, 2014, in an unprovoked attack, a mob armed with sharp weapons poured kerosene on the possessions and homes of 42 families of the traditionally nomadic Banjara community at Dhikola in Shahpura gram panchayat of Bhilwara district. Motorcycles and tractors were reduced to cinders and homes turned into ash. The FIR was registered under sections pertaining to rioting and carrying deadly weapons. There were 141 accused and 46 were arrested.On Friday, arguing against the withdrawal of the FIR by the government, Suresh Srimali , lawyer of the Banjaras, said that the charges were grave. Withdrawal of the FIR would be a bolt to the justice delivery mechanism of the state, he said. The court refused to allow the government to withdraw FIR and posted the matter for hearing on August 4.Paras Banjara, the only graduate from the community, said this represented a victory for his people. “Despite our urging, the government refused to review its decision to withdraw the FIR. We are glad the court listened to our plea. The Banjaras are a people with faith in the Constitution and the judiciary. We will continue to struggle for justice.”"

CHANDIGARH: The Haryana government’s decision to hand over the probe of two cases related to damage to the residence and other properties of state finance minister Capt Abhimanyu’s family to the CBI has been challenged in the Punjab and Haryana high court.The main argument against it is that once a probe is completed by the police and investigation report submitted to a magistrate, a fresh investigation into the same matter cannot be ordered. The petitioner, Ashvin, one of the accused in this case and a resident of Chuliyana village in Rohtak district, has sought directions to quash the notification regarding handing over the matter to the CBI.The petition, which came up for hearing on Monday, stated that there were only two FIRs in this regard. In FIR no. 45 there is one accused while in FIR no. 118 there are 40 accused. According to the petitioner, investigation has been completed and final reports have been submitted by the police to the magistrate. After this, now , the state government has referred the matter to the CBI.Ashvin contended that no application was moved by the police before the magistrate, seeking permission for fresh or further investigation or before the higher court seeking permission for a CBI probe Strongly opposing the state government’s move, the petitioner has argued that the said powers could only be exercised where the investigation has not been completed and if completed, the magistrate has not taken cognizance of that report.“If the investigation has been completed on the same set of allegations pertaining to the same offence by the police and the final report under section 173 (2) of the CrPC has been submitted before the court on which the magistrate has taken cognizance and has committed the case to the competent court, then the powers to send it to the CBI for further probe cannot be exercised,” he argued.After hearing the arguments of the petitioner, Justice Rajesh Bindal of the HC referred it for further hearing before a bench headed by Justice S S Saron, which is already hearing the cases related to Jat reservation."

NEW DELHI: CBI has registered two separate cases in connection with the alleged arson at Indus Public School and Haribhoomi Press in Rohtak during the Jat quota agitation in February last year.These properties reportedly belong to trusts run by Haryana minister Captain Abhimanyu, CBI sources said.The CBI move comes after the Centre referred the cases to it on February 6, 2017, nearly an year after the incidents.At least 30 people were killed and properties worth crores of rupees were destroyed in Haryana during the violent quota agitation by Jats in February, 2016.The protesters were seeking reservation in government jobs and educational institutes for the Jat community under the category of Other Backward Classes.It is alleged that some people gathered around the school in Rohtak on the evening of February 19. These people threatened the guard and ransacked the school.On February 20, a mob of 100-150 people armed with oil cannisters and rods gathered around the school. They allegedly ransacked the property and put the building, school buses and other vehicles on the properties on fire.In the complaint, the guard has named several individuals including some former village heads of the area.CBI has registered a case of rioting and arson against 10 persons on the basis of his statement.Second FIR pertains to alleged arson at Haribhoomi Press in Rohtak which was also set on fire by a mob in the intervening night of February 19-20.The FIR has been registered against eight persons on the basis of the statement of the manager of the press.It is alleged that a loss of around Rs 15.50 crore was caused by the alleged rioters."

MEHSANA/RAJKOT:Patels agitating for reservation on Monday set fire to the Mehsana bungalow of Gujarat junior home minister Rajnikant Patel.The arson attack came as police booked over 5,000 people for violence that began on Sunday following a ‘jail bharo’ call issued by Patidar organizations for an employment and education quota as well as the immediate release of activists leading the movement, including Hardik Patel.Patidars had also torched the minister’s house in August last year when the stir for quota first erupted."

Nagpur: Three days after the Naxalites allegedly torched 80 vehicles deployed by contractors engaged by Lloyds Metals and Energy Ltd at Surjagarh iron ore mines in Gadchiroli, the company has assessed its loss at Rs13 crore. It had begun mining operations in April this year, after a deadlock since 2007 due to opposition by the Naxalites against any activity in the area.“Salvaging the equipment is the first priority now. No decision has been taken on restarting the operations yet. However, after going so far and investing a sizeable amount, abandoning the project will certainly not be the company’s priority,” said a source involved in running the mines.The company has so far taken away only the iron ore available on the surface with excavation work not even having started. Since October, 80,000 tons have been extracted, as against the permitted quantity of 6 lakh tons per annum in the mining plan.“The iron ore is being used in the company’s processing plant at Ghuggus (neighbouring Chandrapur district),” said company sources.Lloyds is the only company doing operations in Surjagarh as permits to many big companies were taken back as they showed no interest to start work.The minister of state for home Hansraj Ahir, who is from Chandrapur district, held a review meeting on Tuesday, in which the company’s officials submitted their version. He also spoke to the CRPF and police.Talking to TOI, company officials claimed that there was no direct interference from the Naxalites so far. “Why they chose to burn down the trucks is not known,” he said.However, sources following the developments hint at a recent friction between the contractors involved in the work and the Naxalites.“Chances of the locals employed in the company doubling up as Naxals cannot be ruled out as burning down 70 vehicles has to be the handiwork of a huge mob,” said an independent source who has been closely observing the the work at the mines.The company had got a mining licence for an area of 340 hectares in the Surjagargh hills, over 100 kms from Gadchiroli town. The first attempt to mine in 2008 could not succeed as Naxals burnt down vehicles and beat up the staffers. Later, in 2013, the company’s vice-president Jaspal Dhillon was killed in a reported attempt to negotiate with the rebels.Finally, in April this year the company began operation and so far only an area of 4 hectares out of 340 have been utilized. Rest of the land is yet to be diverted by the state’s forest department, a process which will take place gradually.Local sources say that the mining could begin as Naxal leadership in the area had softened its stance as a number of locals were employed in the project too. Again, in June, the work had stopped following an agitation.This time it was led by local leaders demanding that the company set up an iron ore processing plant close to the mines. The work was also halted due to the monsoon but started again in October.Sources following the development say that friction between the contractors running the vehicles and Naxalites could also be the reason for the incident. Demonetization has hit the availability of cash in the interiors, leading to some friction over payments."

PUNE: Investigations have revealed that stationery shopowner Aman Abdul Shaikh (33), who was arrested on Saturday for allegedly torching 92 vehicles on Sinhagad Road and Narhe areas on June 28, had conducted a recce of all the spots a day before committing the crime.""On tracking Shaikh's cellphone locations, it was found that he had visited all the six spots a day before the incident. He had planned the arson well in advance,"" said Nitin Jadhav, the investigating officer and senior inspector of the Sinhagad Road police station. Now, we are collecting information about his whereabouts on June 28, he added.We are also verifying his whereabouts on the day of incident and also what he had done till he was arrested on Saturday,"" senior inspector of the Sinhagad Road police station Nitin Jadhav, who is investigating the case, said.Shaikh, who was arrested on Saturday night, was produced before the court on Sunday and remanded to police custody till July 7.While seeking his custody, Jadhav told the court that residents of Sai Palace of Vadgaon-Budruk, where Shaikh resides with his family, have identified the suspect because of the limp in his right leg, which was also captured in a closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera footage. ""Around a year ago, Shaikh had set ablaze one motorcycle in his society. He also had two similar cases registered against him with the Khadki police station,"" Jadhav said.Though police are yet to ascertain the motive behind the incident, Jadhav told the court that investigations are being done to find out if someone had instigated him to commit the crime or the act was done only to create law and order problem.Meanwhile, police also recovered a scooter from Shaikh. ""However, we are yet to confirm if the same was used in committing the crime since the registration number of the scooter is not clear in the CCTV camera footages,"" Jadhav told the court. Police are also probing the modus operandi of the suspect and if there were any witnesses in the case, he added.Jadhav said police are yet to recover the clothes Shaikh wore on the night of the incident. ""We want to send the clothes for chemical analysis,"" he said.Shaikh's counsel I H Hasmani told the court that his client was arrested only on the basis of suspicion. ""Police have nothing to prove his involvement in the case. He has been arrested on the basis of the old cases registered against him. But, he has been acquitted in one of the two cases,"" Hasmani said.After hearing both the sides, the judicial magistrate first class S S Pignle sent Shaikh to the police custody till July 7.On June 28, as many as 77 two-wheelers, eight cars and seven bicycles were set ablaze at a pizza outlet and five housing societies — all located along a five-km stretch from Anandnagar on Sinhagad Road to Narhe. The pandemonium continued for one-and-half-hour.The fires in the parking spaces of the housing societies had created panic among residents."

Mumbai: The 37th metropolitan magistrate court has issued a production warrant to jail authorities in Mumbai asking them to produce former deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal in connection with an attack on his house in 1997.The court is in the last leg of winding up the 20-year-old case in which 11 Shiv Sainiks are accused. Bhujbal’s statement will be recorded in the case. The former minister, who has been arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in cases related to money laundering and the construction of Maharashtra Sadan and the varsity library deal, is currently lodged in Arthur Road prison. It has to be seen whether or not the jail authorities will produce him in the court on November 28, which clashes with the dates related to the cases that the ED is pursuing. The court wants to record his statement in the nearly two decades old case in which he is a witness. Crime branch officials have recorded the statements of around 36 witnesses and only Bhujbal’s testimony is remaining. “Once Bhujbal’s statement is recorded the court is likely to deliver the verdict,” said a police officer. The case was later transferred to the crime branch, which arrested around 23 Sainiks. Eight people were later discharged as the police could not find evidence against them."

HOWRAH: A Trinamool faction fight kept Shalimar rail yard in Howrah on the boil all through Friday - with less than 24 hours to go before Kolkata goes to polls - after the brother of a party councillor died of gunshots suffered in a clash on April 6.Five trucks, three trailers and an SUV were set ablaze just 800 yards from Mamata Banerjee's headquarters at Nabanna.Bands of hooligans played a cat-and-mouse game with police as they went around torching vehicles. The harried cops struggled to keep up and at one point, disaster was averted by a hair's breadth after a trailer was set fire too close to a mall. The tyres started exploding and columns of smoke shot into the shopping complex. Luckily, the fire brigade responded quickly and doused the flames. According to police, the miscreants had dipped bread in petrol and used it to set fire to the vehicles.The area has been tense ever since two factions, allegedly owing allegiance to Howrah Municipal Corporation councillor Benoy Singh and his business and political rival Pradip Tiwari, fired at each other 10 days ago. Benoy's brother Vinod and nephew Rakesh Singh were injured. Vinod, who was in coma after being shot in the chest, died on Friday. As soon as news reached Howrah, a mob set fire to an Innova parked in front of Tiwari's office. Tiwari's brother Paritosh is accused of shooting Vinod and Rakesh, say sources.Singh and Tiwari are clearing agents at the yard and the April 6 clash had disrupted loading and unloading, leading to losses of crores. The gunfight also opened up chinks in the Howrah Trinamool ranks.During the last corporation polls in 2013, Singh had contested on a Congress ticket and defeated Trinamool candidate Tiwari in Ward 35. Singh, however, defected to Trinamool after his victory. Pradip Tiwari, a former Left Front councillor from the ward, had been handpicked by Mukul Roy but is now cornered in the party ever since his mentor, too, was sidelined.Trinamool district president Aroop Roy said, ""Tiwari was always with the Left and came to our party for personal gain. We have information that he will have go back to the Left after his interest is over. We have expelled him from the party.""However, a section of the party ranks alleges that Tiwari was sheltered by Trinamool MP from Howrah Prasun Banerjee, who made him president of the Trinamool port union. Trinamool councilor Sailesh Rai said, ""It is very unfortunate that despite his expulsion from the party he has been given shelter by a party MP."" Prasun called the allegation baseless. ""When I became MP, Tiwari asked for a job in the party. I made him president of the port cell but later I found he is of no use,"" he told TOI.All the accused in the April 6 violence - Tiwari's relatives Paritosh, Anup, Anil, Kamlesh, Ajay and Sanjay - are on the run, say police. SRP Kharagpur Joy Biswas said, ""They have fled but we have some information and are trying to arrest them."" Sources in Howrah police say Paritosh's mobile phone has been tracked to Uttar Pradesh. ""Till three days ago, they were being given shelter by one of Pradip's relatives in north Howrah, but by the time we got there, they had fled. We are tracking them and they will be arrested very soon,"" said an officer."

BHUBANESWAR: Subhash Ramachandran, a Tamil Nadu resident accused of setting ablaze a series of empty trains in Puri on November 12 and other places in the country, was involved in petty offences in Chennai, police confirmed. Efforts by police to gather more information about him from Tamil Nadu Police failed due to the floods in Chennai.""Between 2011 and 2012, Ramachandran was involved in three theft cases, though he was never arrested. The cases were sorted out by mutual understanding. In 2012, he stole a bike. The same year, he decamped with Rs 5,000 from a hotel where he was employed in Chennai,"" special director (intelligence) Arun Sarangi told TOI.While the NIA on December 3 took up the case, police said the floods hindered their investigation. ""Ramachandran belongs to Tirunelveli district in Tamil Nadu. Since he spent most of his years in that state, we needed to know his antecedents. But, the Chennai cloudburst posed hurdles for us,"" Sarangi said.Police still believe Ramachandran's activities were suspicious and he had links with some terror outfit. But the cops are yet to ascertain the name of the group. ""Ramachandran has so far not revealed the name of any subversive group. He only claimed that five terrorists paid him money to cause the attacks. He also claimed that a terror module was prepared in Mumbai. There is no corroborative evidence of his statements,"" Sarangi said.Earlier, Ramachanadran had told the railway police that he came in contact with the terrorists during last year's Chennai train blast. He claimed that the terrorists were linked to an agency in Pakistan, after which Odisha Police on November 26 recommended that the Centre hand over the probe to the NIA.On December 7, Ramachandran underwent a polygraph test at the state forensic science laboratory. Police received the report on Thursday. ""We wanted to verify whether his earlier statements were true. Of 24 questions asked to him, he gave deceitful replies to nine. He gave contradictory statements, which he has done in the past too. He reiterated that he knew five terrorists. He claimed they were from Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan and Bangladesh. But there is no evidence to confirm this information. He also spoke of his girlfriend and said he needed more money. He also claimed to have undergone training in Mumbai. His statements will be verified,"" ADG (railway police) M Nageswar Rao said. On Friday, a senior NIA officer met DGP K B Singh."

AHMEDABAD: Police on Wednesday nabbed Rasik Chauhan, 30, a resident of Bhimjipura in Nava Vadaj, for burning about a dozen bikes and an ATM center.Police said Chauhan derived sadistic pleasure from the act. ""We suspect that Chauhan, who himself is an auto driver, had dreams to buy a bike but could not because of his poor economic condition,"" said a police official.Since the past 14 days complaints of bikes being torched in the night as well as in the daytime were on the rise in the jurisdiction of Narapura police.""On Wednesday, we arrested Chauhan from Bhimjipura crossroads on a tip off and found a match box in his pocket. On being quizzed he admitted he used to torch the bikes and even tried to torch an ATM center in Silver Plaza in Bhimjipura,"" said the official.Police said Chauhan smokes bidis and always keeps a match box with him. ""Whenever he felt that no one was watching he would pull the petrol pipe of the bike and throw a burning matchstick,"" the official said.During primary interrogation it came to light that Chauhan had got petrol from bike parked outside the ATM center. He then threw the petrol on the ATM center and set it ablaze with a matchstick.Chauhan had set ablaze vehicles near Naranpura railway crossing, Sorabji compound and Juna Vadaj area. ""We are probing whether Chauhan is involved in such incidents in other parts of the city as well"" added the official."

BHUBANESWAR: Subhash Ramachandran, suspected of having link with a terror group and prime accused in the burning of empty trains in Puri and other places in India, underwent marathon grilling by police during a polygraph test here on Monday.Official sources said the lie-detection test came a cropper as the 27-year-old Ramachandran dodged most of the queries. ""He did not cooperate with us during the polygraph test. His answers to a few questions were vague and contradictory to his previous confessions in police custody,"" said a police officer.The government railway police (GRP) had sought a Puri court's permission for lie-detection test on Ramachandran after his inconsistent replies during interrogation in the custody.Ramachandran was asked at least 120 questions at the State Forensic Science Laboratory from 10.15am to 5.15pm. Since he belongs to Tamil Nadu, police engaged a Tamil interpreter for the polygraph test.On December 3, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) took over the investigation into burning of empty trains in Puri, Haridwar, Gaya and Kharagpur. On November 26, the state government recommended NIA probe after finding suspected terror link behind the incidents. The NIA SP Prashant Kumar has been camping in Bhubaneswar for the past few days and interrogating Ramachandran. A team of police officers from Kharagpur and Haridwar have already interrogated Ramachandran.Official sources said the NIA is likely to conduct brain-mapping on Ramachandran. India's only forensic science laboratory that conducts brain-mapping or brain-wave fingerprinting test is located in Bangalore.It is a test that maps the brain to reveal the guilty knowledge. Forensic experts would apply modern technologies to find out if the brain of the accused recognizes sequences from the crime scene that is oblivious to an innocent person, a police officer said. In brain-mapping, the accused is first interrogated to find out whether he is concealing any information. Then sensors are attached to the subjects head and the person is made to sit before a computer monitor. He is then shown certain images or made to hear certain sounds. The sensors monitor electrical activity in the brain, the police officer added.Even though brain mapping is considered one of the most effective aspect of forensic science these days, lawyers said it would not be admissible as an evidence in the court of law. ""Outcomes of polygraph, narco test and brain-mapping are just corroborative evidence. It will not help police prove a suspect guilty,"" said Orissa high court lawyer Bibhu Prasad Tripathy."

BHUBANESWAR: Subhash Ramachandran, accused of setting ablaze a series of empty trains in Puri and other places in the country, told police on Monday that a terror module was prepared in Mumbai by five terrorists to cause arson attacks in trains that connect to different pilgrim destinations across India.The revelation coincided with the Intelligence Bureau (IB) reportedly moving the ministry of home affairs to order an NIA probe into the case on Monday. The IB has been tracking the outcome of Ramachandran's interrogation by Odisha Police and the Indian Railways authorities.""Ramachandran said the terrorist outfit had big plans to trigger arson attacks in trains at holy cities. He said he travelled with the five terrorists to Gaya, Haridwar and Kharagpur, where they set ablaze some empty trains this month. Ramachandran then came to Puri alone with an assignment to set fire to trains in the pilgrim town,"" a senior police official told TOI.""Ramachandran said he came in contact with the terrorists during the Chennai train blast in May last year. The terrorists used him as he was in dire need of money. We are in touch with the IB and Mumbai Police to ascertain the identities of the five men,"" the officer said.On Monday, Ramachandran was sent back to judicial custody in Puri following completion of his six-day remand, sought by the Government Railway Police (GRP), Odisha. ""We have sought his remand for nine more days to elicit more information from him.

Thane: All the 18 men accused of the arson attack in Bhiwandi , which led to the death of two on-duty constables in July 2006, walked free after the district sessions court on September 1 quashed charges of rioting and assault on police personnel against them.The lack of clinching evidence, failure to ensure air-tight statements of witness and procedural flaws in the identification parade of the accused led to the acquittal, it is learnt. Judge A S Bhaisare ruled that the prosecution failed to prove charges beyond reasonable doubt and, giving them the benefit of doubt, set them free.The case had aroused strong sentiments across the state as it was the first time after the Mumbai riots that clashes had erupted between police and members of a minority community in the powerloom township.The immediate trigger of the violence was opposition of the community, then led by Raza Academy, against construction of a police station on a plot near the Muslim-dominated pocket of Islampura. The land, earmarked for a police station, was opposite a masjid and adjoining a Muslim cemetery, and community leaders demanded that the land be allotted for an Urdu medium school and the cemetery area must be extended.Additional public prosecutor Dilip Bahiram told the court that the mob led by Raza Academy functionary Shakil Raza started demolishing the under-construction police station and pelted stones at the police on July 5, 2006. At Dhamankar naka police chowky, Shakil Raza, along with around 300 associates came from Patel compound shouting slogans like ‘Police khade hai, unko pakdo aur maro, kato’.A constable was allegedly attacked and her uniform was torn by a mob of women. The constable, however, was rescued by SRPF personnel, who were later stoned by the mob.Constables Ramesh Jagtap and Balu Gangurde, who were patrolling on a motorcycle, were stoned and then attacked with rods and sharps weapons by mostly teenagers and youths, and their two-wheeler was torched. The constables died on the spot.Advocate Dhananjay Patil, who argued for the accused, told court that the accused were innocent. He did not produce any witness.The issue had triggered a storm in the monsoon session of the state legislature after then home minister R R Patil remarked that the attack against police will not go unanswered. He had said, “Bricks will be retaliated with bullets.’’"

Aligarh: Villagers of Kastali, Jawan in Aligarh poured out into the streets in anger, noticing that cows had been slaughtered and the waste was littering the area. Angry villagers set about burning vehicles used to transport the meat. Policemen present in the area were attacked.On Monday, a day after the arson, SSP Aligarh J Ravinder Goud suspended seven policemen for poor handing of the situation. Policemen found at least 21 cows had been killed. Eleven people from Tonk in Rajasthan have been arrested for selling the cows. The role of others in the illegal slaughter is being investigated.“We have zero-tolerance for those involved in the cow slaughter. Even if policemen are found involved in the theft and slaughter of cows, they will not be spared. There will be increased night patrolling. We will conduct an identification drive, to keep tabs on people with a history of such activity. In politics, these incidents can get a different colour. As far as maintaining law and order is concerned, we will not let this be the cause of a communal disturbance. Just as people accused of cow slaughter in Tappal were charged under the Gangster Act, we will, after investigations, slap similar charges on the accused in this case too,” Goud said.Samajwadi Party leader Ajju Ishaq, also city president of the party, said, “This case just played into the hands of the BJP. This was another attempt to recreate Muzaffarnagar (which witnessed riots in 2013). Police investigations will get to the bottom of it.”Ishaq questioned how the Hindu right wing leaders were the first to reach the spot of the cow slaughter. He raised questions about the number of cows police said were slaughtered. “Why would someone risk slaughtering such a large number of cows when it would be so hard for it to go unnoticed?” he asked.SP’s Kohl MLA Haji Zameer Ullha Khan, who had earlier launched a movement asking the Muslims to desist from animal slaughter in a bid to create a condition of communal amity, said, “It was an issue being used to polarize the people here. We have to be very careful as notorious elements are trying to give a communal colour to such crime. After Bakr-Eid, I will resume my cow protection drive. Till 2017 elections, we have to be on the watch to ensure that no situation goes out of control – that would be to the benefit of some political parties.”Raghu Raj Singh, vice president of the BJP in UP, said he and his party had nothing to do with the incident. “This is not the first case of cow slaughter reported from the area. Religious sentiments are attached to the cow. We first feed the cow in the morning before having our own first meal of the day. Our concern is to stop cow slaughter. For that, we will meet the authorities to get this case solved in 15 days.”"

VILLUPURAM: Though the fire tender could not enter the narrow street where the house was located the fire and rescue services personnel managed to prevent fire spreading to the nearby houses and other structures.

Police did not rule out inter-caste tensions behind the fire. The fire could also have been triggered accidentally, police said.

A section of most-backward classes' people disconnected the power connection to the dalit colony, before attacking them on August 15. The violence was triggered by a temple festival, which involved a rally in the village. The violent mob ransacked houses and properties belonging to the dalit community. The temple car and five houses were set on fire.

Fifteen people including six policemen were injured in the clash. Police arrested 82 people including seven women and seven minors on August 16. Police booked them for rioting, attempting to murder, voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons, torching houses and other properties and criminal intimidation.

Police also booked them under various sections of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

Police arrested the political leaders in the village, irrespective of party affiliations responsible for community clashes in the area.

They said the political leaders trigger caste sentiments to gain political mileage."

Recently, 10 two-wheelers of women medicos were torched in the parking lot of hostel number two at Government Medical College. The girls who are staying on the hostel premises are now raising some serious concerns related to their safety on campus. The incident has sent shock waves through the entire medical fraternity and has forced the GMC authorities to take strong measures, but there is more to be done to ensure safety of women medicos. We explore the security aspects of the medical college which need immediate attention…The women’s hostel number two where the incident occurred, is adjacent to the Superspecialty Hospital of the Government Medical College and the land behind the hostel leads to slum area. “The fact that something so shocking can happen inside the medical college of this stature is a matter of concern for me and all of us living here. Although the college authorities have installed CCTV cameras inside the hostel premises now, the lack of fencing remains a big concern as anyone can enter the hostel easily and damage or steal property,” laments Divya Sharma, second year MBBS student of GMC.One of the reasons the students feel threatened especially during night is poor lighting across the premises. The place is also infamous for eve-teasing and molestation incidents. “We return to our hostel between 9.30pm and 10pm after attending the classes and the coaching classes. Chain-snatching and eve-teasing incidents in the evening are common here and lack of lighting across the area makes us feel quite unsafe. We have raised this issue with the college administration, but it seems they care less about these aspects,” says Nikita Gangwani, a first year MBBS student.When we contacted GMC dean Dr Abhimanyu Niswade, he said: “Students’ security is on the top of our priority list. The case is under investigation by the Ajni police, so I won’t comment on it, but I suspect it is a possible sabotage by miscreants. We have already installed CCTV cameras inside the premises and are renovating the boundary wall. The presence of antisocial elements would be checked by the guards now.” When asked why the precautionary measures were not taken earlier, he ended the conversation saying that he will ensure the safety of every student inside the campus now.The incident has not only disturbed the medical students but their parents as well. One of the victims whose two-wheeler was torched informed us on the condition of anonymity, “My parents live in Kerala and this incident has shocked my family. My father has decided to visit Nagpur to meet the dean and speak to him about the lack of security on campus. If our college had taken the simple security measures earlier, it would have saved us a lot of pain and anguish.”"

MARGAO: A huge blaze gutted the house of Colva resident Gabriel Gomes on the intervening night of Thursday and Friday, when the occupants of the house were away. Sources in the fire and emergency services told TOI that they averted a major catastrophe by removing two LPG cylinders – a mini cylinder of 5kg and another weighing 14.2kg from the house.Goods, mostly household items, worth 2.30 lakh were gutted in the fire. “If the cylinders exploded in the fire, the damage would have been much worse and difficult to bring under control,” divisional fire officer, Rajendra Haldanker told TOI. “What made our task even more difficult was the lack of an access road to the house,” Haldankar added.While the cause of fire is yet to be ascertained, fire and emergency officials suspect it to be a case of arson . “I have written to the electricity department to check if short-circuit could have led to the fire. I have also written to the police to investigate a possibility of arson,” Haldankar said."

Bhubaneswar: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Tuesday ruled out any terror angle behind last year's burning of empty trains at Puri. The NIA submitted its closure report in its special court here and said the prime accused Subhash Ramachandran is not a terrorist.NIA said the accused was suffering from a psychological disorder and wanted to be famous by misleading police.On November 12, 2015, government railway police (GRP) arrested Ramachandran for allegedly setting afire five coaches of three empty trains at Puri station. A native of Tamil Nadu, Ramachandran created a flutter by linking the incident to five terrorists in Mumbai and said they were also behind the train arsons in Gaya, Haridwar and Kharagpur. Considering the interstate ramification of the case, the state police had recommended NIA probe.""During investigation, the NIA found little evidence of terror link behind the train arson. Ramachandran misled us by giving some fake names of terrorists. His statement could not be substantiated. Since there is no terror link in the incident, the NIA gave a closure report,"" said a senior lawyer.On December 10, the train burning case was shifted from Puri court to the NIA's special court at Khurda sessions court in Bhubaneswar. The NIA has now appealed to the special court to transfer the case back to Puri, the lawyer said.On December 3, the NIA took over the investigation after Odisha Police found suspected terror link behind the sabotage. The GRP in Puri and Bhubaneswar interrogated Ramachandran at least thrice. He underwent a polygraph test on December 7 and told police that some terrorists had hired him for the arson attacks."

LUCKNOW: The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) inquiry into the July 15, 2009, arson at the Mall Avenue residence of the then state Congress president Rita Baguhuna Joshi may have established a conspiracy angle in the crime, but the agency has failed to even remotely identify the main conspirator. In the high profile case, the scene of crime was a stone's throw distance from the then chief minister Mayawati's government accommodation.The report states that as a part of a pre-planned conspiracy, police reached the venue around four hours before the premises was set ablaze and forcibly took away all seven individuals present there including the police gunner of the then UPCC chief. It was almost four hours after the occupants were taken away that the premises was set on fire.The main witness in the CID report happens to be former domestic help of Joshi who was present in house when the other occupants were allegedly herded away by the police but managed to stay back as she slipped under a bed in one of the rooms. While this domestic help stood witness to what all happened at the premises four hours later, those taken away by the police were detained at the Hazratganj Kotwali without being assigned any reason whatsoever for their detention.The 400-odd paged report does admit that the incident was part of a conspiracy but fails to detail any further. The report had been sent to the state government for further action. As per the norms, it was up to the state government to decide the fate of the report. Sources in the government have confirmed that the 15 cops who have been identified as accused in the case have been found fit for prosecution under sections 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common goal), 427 (mischief causing damage to property worth Rs 50 or more), 365 (kidnapping for illegal confinement), 342 (Punishment for wrongful confinement ? one year or fine or both), 218 (Public servant misleads investigations to save accuse ? three years imprisonment) and 120 (B) (Criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC)."

The heat of Allahabad violence and arson after a lawyer was murdered in court premises was also felt in Varanasi after an irate mob of lawyers attacked the senior superintendent of police ( SSP ) office and also damaged vehicles of three magistrates near rifle club on collectorate premises by indulging in brickbatting on Wednesday late afternoon.Perhaps the district administration and police failed to take any precautionary measures even after two hours of Allahabad incident. The casual approach of officials was exposed when a group of youth lawyers came out of central bar association building, where CBA and Banaras Bar Association had convened a joint meeting to condemn the killing of a lawyer in police firing at Allahabad, and raided the SSP office.Initially some lawyers leading these demonstrators tried to stage a sit-in in front of SSP’s office. However, other members of this group started attacking the offices of SSP and SP (rural) with flower pots kept there. When the incident occured some ASPs, circle officers and few police personnel were present there. Some of the cops came out of their offices to stop the demonstrators. On seeing it the lawyers indulged in brickbatting and started running towards district magistrate office.To stop the angry lawyers, cops also started brickbatting compelling the lawyers to leave collectorate premises. But before running towards district court compound they damaged the official SUVs of chief revenue officer (CRO), city magistrate and ACM-II. With the sounding of alert through wireless heavy police force from several police station and PAC reached collectorate premises.Later, the DM Pranjal Yadav and SSP Jogendra Kumar reached there to take stock of situation. After holding a closed door meeting with their subordinates, who remained eye witness of violence, the DM said that police have video recording of the incident, which will help in identifying the lawyers remained involved in attacking the SSP office and vehicles of magistrates. However, the officials could not make it clear whether any FIR is being lodged in this connection.Yadav said that stern action would be taken in this episode that will be visible in two-three days. The officials claimed that in view of Allahabad incident necessary precautions were initiated but some lawyers managed to reach SSP office.On the other hand with the incident of attacking SSP office by a group of lawyers a line of division also surfaced in lawyers fraternity as majority of them preferred to quit the district court and collectorate premises. The office bearers of CBA as well as BBA also avoided commenting on the incident of attacking SSP office."

Bareilly: In a goof up during a recent investigation, Bareilly cops accidentally named a dead man as the prime suspect in an incident of group clash which took place a week back in Baradari locality.The mistake was later rectified when the deceased’s wife brought the information to the cops’ notice.According to reports, two families living in Siklapur locality clashed over the issue of construction of a boundary wall between their houses. Cops arrested four people on charges of rioting while six were injured and taken to the hospital.Kamini Yadav, registered as wife of late Raghuvir Yadav, lodged a complaint against her neighbours, Sanju Yadav, Mahendra Singh, Mahesh and Guddu, accusing them of illegally encroaching on land that belonged to her family.A member of the other family, Kiran Yadav, also lodged a complaint against Kamini and named her dead husband as the prime suspect.At that time, police did not take note of this fact and started conducting the necessary formalities until the issue was raised by Kamini and a few other local residents who told the cops that her husband had died a year and a half ago.Rajeev Malhotra, SP city, said, “We have already take note of this mistake and removed the name of the deceased Raghuvir Yadav from the complaint and summoned the opposite party to find out as to why he named him in the complaint despite knowing that he is already dead. If they fail to provide satisfactory explanation, necessary action would be taken against them.”"

SHILLONG: Even as violence continued during the three-night road blockade called by organizations demanding introduction of Inner Line Permit (ILP) system in the state, six people, including three Khasi Students Union (KSU) activists, were arrested for their involvement in arson.A two-wheeler and haystack were set on fire in two separate incidents and a police mobile vehicle driver was assaulted on Friday night after the road blockade started around 10pm.According to East Khasi hills SP M Kharkhrang, the three KSU volunteers were arrested when they were burning a haystack belonging to a local, Gajendra Rai, at Pynthorbah in the city. He said the fire was quickly extinguished.In another incident, when a driver of a police mobile party parked his vehicle at Mawiong near the Mawphor office and entered a shop to buy 'kwai' (betel nuts), three boys came in a local taxi and assaulted him around 11.15pm. The SP said a police team immediately rushed to the spot and apprehended the three youths.Miscreants also set on fire a two-wheeler at Lumparing around 11pm. ""Police are investigating the case and trying to find out the culprits,"" a police officer said.The organizations have been demanding introduction of the ILP system to check illegal immigration and influx of 'outsiders' into the state. However, the state government has been arguing that according to the latest Census report, non-tribal population in the predominantly tribal state has gone down from about 20 per cent in 1971, when Meghalaya was formed, to just about 13 per cent at present.During recent meetings with the organizations, including student bodies and political parties, chief minister Mukul Sangma had iterated that the state government was not in favour of introducing the ILP, as it was a redundant piece of law."

Cases have been registered under sections 427 (mischief), 435 (mischief by fire with an intent to cause damage) and 447 (criminal trespass) of IPC at Tadepalli and Tullur police stations.While the police are yet to nab the culprits, the horrific episode has already taken a political colour what with farmers alleging the ‘involvement’ of the Andhra Pradesh government in the crime. They claim that the government, in a desperate attempt to forcibly take over their land for the development of new capital, burnt down their nurseries.Plantations apart, several banana nurseries located in Undavalli, Penumaka, Mandadam, Lingayapalem, Moodha Lingayapalem and Venkatapalem villages in the two mandals were also damaged in Sunday’s incident. If that’s not all, the blaze even reduced drip irrigation pipelines, motors, huts and electrical wires to ashes. While locals claimed they saw about 8-10 suspects flee from the spot, police are yet to ascertain the same.Predictably irked by the development, locals of the area are now up in arms against the government and have vowed to not part with their land at any cost. “The government wants to create panic and force us to vacate the fields and villages so that it can usurp it,” said Narsa Reddy, a farmer.Incidentally, a majority of farmers living in villages on the right bank of the Krishna river have been for long opposing the Chandrababu Naidu government’s attempts to acquire these fields for construction of the capital city. This, despite the pressure being mounted on them by the ruling TDP leaders as well as local realtors.“How can this government claim to be a champion of farmers’ issues when it is trying to terrorize them?” asked M Seshareddy, a farmer of Penumaka, echoing the sentiment of many others. The affected farmers have now demanded compensation from the government for the mishap.While AP police chief J V Ramudu, who was camping in Vijayawada, rushed both the SPs of Guntur, Rajesh Kumar and P H D Ramakrishna, to the villages for a first hand report ,said that the incident “looked like a sabotage”, agriculture minister Prattipati Pullarao wasted no time it putting the blame on the YSRCP. He alleged that it was Jagan’s ploy to scuttle the construction of capital city in Guntur and maintained that the government had no intention to take the land by force.YSRCP leaders, while condemning the act, demanded that the state government order a probe by the CBI or a sitting high court judge into the arson. “Let CBI bring out the facts,” chief spokesperson of YSRCP, Ambati Rambabu, said. He added: “It is an open secret that the CM was threatening the farmers with dire consequences if they did not part with their land. Who else would be behind such a heinous act?”.Meanwhile, expressing shock over the incident, chief minister Chandrababu Naidu directed Guntur collector Kanthilal Dande, to probe the incident and submit a report at the earliest."

NEW DELHI: Till riots broke out in 1984, blocks 30 and 32 in Trilokpuri housed hundreds of Sikh families. Three decades later only horrific memories of arson and killings exist there. Barring a handful of survivors of 15 riot-hit families, most people fled for their lives when the blood-thirsty mob launched their attack on the locality. Those who came out of hiding once the situation became normal relocated to the Tilak Vihar area. The recent communal tension in Trilokpuri has revived some of those memories, prompting the survivors to once again demand justice for what had happened 30 years ago.Kanwaljeet Singh Sandhu is a resident of block 30 in Trilokpuri. His elder brothers, then teenagers, were burnt alive near Laxmi Nagar during the '84 riots. His wife Simranjeet, then an eight-year-old who lived in Shahdara had seen her grandfather dying-he too was burnt alive by the miscreants-before her eyes.When tension gripped Trilokpuri last week, Sandhu and his wife had packed off their two sons to their relatives' house. The couple say they didn't want their children to live in fear. Pointing at a photograph of his parents mounted on the wall, Sandhu said, ""My father died 10 years ago waiting for justice. My mother passed away four years ago-she feared that my sons would meet the similar fate. Punish the guilty and the powerful involved in the crime, that's what we want.""""It's a very long story. Neither we can tell you nor will you be able to hear it,"" said 75-year-old Sardar Harminder Singh, who survived a murder bid by hiding in a trunk for three days. A Hindu family had given shelter. Singh runs a workshop in Trilokpuri and watches all updates on the 1984 riots on his TV.People in Trilokpuri still point out the chowk that turned into a pyre of sort, stormwater drains and parks from where the Army pulled out the bodies of the victims. They recalled how mediapersons rushing to the rescue of the Sikhs hiding in cupboards, big trunks and under beds to escape death.Even in neighbouring Shakarpur and Kalyanpuri, survivors come forward to share their ordeal. In Kalyanpuri's block 13, Ravinder Singh revealed how he lost his father in the riots. Ten men from various families from the block were killed by the rioters in November 1984. Mohabbat Singh (70) said the police and the administration did not act firmly leading to escalation of violence.Kuldeep Sandhu, now a 38-year-old music director, said that the successive governments had not paid attention to families like his as compensation had come in parts over two decades. ""We needed help when we were children. A compensation of Rs 3 lakh came in the late 1990s and another Rs 3 lakh around 2008. In such cases, compensation must be disbursed on time so that people get some relief in their worst hour,"" Sandhu said."

MYSORE: Come summer, forest fires are a common phenomena in national parks particularly in the forests encompassing tiger projects. Henceforth wrongdoers have to think twice as state government has decided to hand over all the cases of forest fires to Central Bureau of Investigation( CBI).This decision of the state government at the behest of forest department and tiger project officials is definitely going to inject a sense of fear into the mind of the criminals and other vested elements who on occasions instigated gullible tribals and others to set fire to forest.State government has taken this decision in view of the coming summer when anti-social elements will be at their best and try to destroy the forest wealth. It is said that on occasions , many NGO leaders have either instigated tribals or hired outside elements to set fire to forest cover, particularly the forest cover of tiger parks. These NGOs allegedly with an intention to get funds from foreign agencies involved with wild life conservation and protection activities conspired and presented a gloomy picture of burned forests and life of tigers in the tiger projects.According to forest department officials tiger project officials and other forest department men were a worried lot with the approach of summer and remained on their toes to extinguish the fire. Despite they being on high alert they were unable to check fire incidents, a source said , adding that now criminals , particularly those working at the behest of NGOs will hesitate to indulge in this destructive activity as they will be scared of getting exposed.Confirming the decision, Bandipur tiger project director and CCF H C Kantharaju welcomed the move as criminals, particularly the conspirators will think twice on the issue. ""We have taken a decision on the issue last month and henceforth all cases of arson will be handed over to CBI directly without waiting or seeking the nod of state government"" he revealed and optimistically added: now organized forest fires will be the things of the past"" he added. Even government is planning to hand over the major incidents of forest crimes to CBI, but now initially CBI will investigate and handle the arson cases in forest areas, particularly in state’s five project tiger areas. DEED chief Srikanth welcomed the decision , but he questioned the forest officials claim on NGOs. Forest department officials instead of making surpassing remarks against NGOs should set right their house in order where internal rivalry among the officials is also one of the prime reason behind the forest fires."

CALANGUTE: Two storage sheds used by a beach shack operator to store his shack material and a water sports operator to shelter his boat were reduced to ashes in a fire at Cobrawaddo, Calangute , on Wednesday evening. The loss is estimated at around 5 lakh.Police sources say the fire broke out at around 3.30pm, following which locals attempted to douse the flames, while a fire brigade was also called for. The fire brigade could not gain access to the site as the road has been dug up for sewerage work. Despite efforts, both sheds were completely gutted in the fire.The shed which stored beach shack equipment including fridges, tables, chairs, etc, was owned by Viraj Simepuruskar of Calangute, while the boat shed belonged to Krishna Morajkar of Moira. Previous enmity is likely to be the motive behind the incident, police said. Earlier this month, a storage shed owned by a beach shack operator in Candolim had been reduced to ashes, while in June another had been vandalized in Candolim. With the beach shack season about to commence, long-simmering rivalries between beach shack and water sports operators are resulting in such incidents."

SAHARANPUR: The July riots left a trail of burnt shops and broken people. But a bunch of ordinary men and women rose above the communal frenzy exemplifying courage and character. A Hindu couple sheltered three Muslim women for three days during curfew, an old Muslim offered to mortgage his home to help a Sikh whose shop had been reduced to rubble and several faceless heroes stopped rioters from setting shops on fire.When arson began, three Muslim teachers of Wisdom Valley, a school about 18 km from Saharanpur, were taken by surprise. As curfew was clamped, scary rumours spread fast and thick like a dark, storm cloud. Going home was too dangerous.That's when Ashok and Anita Kanwar, who run the school, stepped in. ""We decided they should stay with us till they could be sent home safely,"" recalls Ashok, a former Toronto banker who returned to the western UP town six years ago and set up an affordable school at Ambehta Chand, his native village. For the next three days, the teachers were sheltered at his home on the town's outskirts.The riots happened during the holy month of Ramzan. To make the young women – Arshi Malik of Hiran Maran colony, Sumayla Malik from Behet Adda and Shabina Ramzan of Chipiyan, all in their 20s — feel at home, the Kanwars let them cook in their kitchen. ""They were observing roza. We knew that they'd like spicy food. We let them make their own dishes for sehri, the pre-dawn meal during Ramzan,"" says school principal Anita.""It felt like home. Our parents weren't worried. They knew we were safe. But our neighbours and relatives were anxious,"" says Shabina Ramzan, who enjoys teaching mathematics, like the other two.(The Kanwar couple (right) sheltered three Muslims during the riots.)Not everybody was appreciative of what Ashok and Anita were doing. The reaction in their colony was mixed. Some lauded them. Some were skeptical. ""You're helping these girls. Would their families have done the same if a Hindu girl got stuck in a similar situation,"" one neighbour asked him. Ashok didn't reply. He invited them over the next evening for an informal chat on why riots happen and who benefits from them.The July 26 riots claimed three lives. Officials said 69 vehicles and 263 shops – big, small and tiny – were destroyed. Baljeet Chawla's shop on Ambala Road was looted and set aflame. Days after the incident, a Muslim mason approached him as he was surveying the damage. Expressing dismay and grief at what had transpired, he told Chawla: ""I got my home registered sometime back. These are the papers. Please take them and get a loan."" Chawla remembers: ""I was surprised and touched at his kindness and generosity.""Timber merchant Jerry Bajaj's shop on Idgah Road, escaped arson. ""Rioters wanted to set it on fire. But other Muslims in the area stopped them. You know, there are nice people in every community,"" he says."

The LU ambulance could not be put to use timely and the injured students were rushed to Vivekenand hospital on borrowed motorcycles. Their condition was reported critical and they were referred to KGMU’s trauma centre.As the boys fell unconscious, students passing by shouted and gathered other hostellers. In the tense atmosphere , students initially called up the proctor and dean , students’ welfare. Students alleged there was no response from DSW and the proctor spoke to them rudely. The students found the ambulance driver ’s number and called him but he said he didn’t know the hostel location.Injured students Yatindra Nath Mishra and Durgesh Tripathi were helped by fellow hostellers who borrowed the bikes of the mess owner and a senior student. Since the main gate of the hostel was locked, hostellers jumped off the boundary wall to rush the injured students to the hospital. The hostel provost Arun Kumar followed.Ranting about dilapidated condition of the hostel building and callous attitude of the university authorities, hostellers broke open door of the provosts’ office and vandalized furniture. They set the room on fire. Students alleged the main gate was always locked by authorities. “There was no ambulance and even after half an hour of the incident, no officials came to the spot,’’ said an eye-witness.Police reached the spot 45 minutes after the incident. According to reports, students were joined by others from different hostels and they pelted stones and broke all the lights on the hostel premises. They vandalised furniture and door of 20 hostel rooms. The agitation continued for almost an hour during which students raised anti-university slogans. Students said the first floor railing of the hostel was in poor condition for quite sometime but no attention was paid to maintain it. The two students who fell were standing along the railing, opposite room number 91 and they fell when the railing gave away.A native of Lakhimpur-Kheri, Yatindra lives in room number 95 while Durgesh from Balia resides in room number 98. Both were enrolled in the BSc first year course at LU.PROCTOR SAYS“We sent an ambulance as soon as we came to know about the incident.

LUCKNOW: State government on Thursday put on hold further talks with farmers to acquire land for extension of the NTPC power plant in Tanda , a day after arson and rioting rocked the tehsil over acquisition of land for the proposed project. Government sources said district administration would take into account video recording of the incident to nab persons involved in the crime.Speaking to TOI, District magistrate, Ambedkarnagar , Vivek, said that the rioting took place when they were discussing the issue with farmers' representatives and BJP MP Hari Om Pandey . Former BSP MP Rakesh Pandey was also present then. “Suddenly, rumour spread that people’s representatives had been arrested. This was not true,” he said. Vivek said they had suspended all talks with farmers until the issue settles down.Farmers had resorted to stone pelting hitting a police officer in his eye. In response, police ordered cane charge on the agitating farmers. At least 12 farmers were injured in the incident. According to reports, nine farmers of Samhariya village in Tanda were reportedly called up by the district administration for talks over the land acquisition for the proposed project. Rumours, however, spread that the farmers have been taken into custody by the police and an agitated group of farmers blocked the main Faizabad Tanda highway. A women station officer, Nisha Shukla, who was passing by was chased by the mob. Soon, police started arresting some of the agitating farmers.Earlier this month, the district administration of Ambedkaranagar had taken into account two villages to acquire land of around 750 farmers. State government plans to acquire nine villages in and around Tanda tehsil to pave way for extension of 440MW thermal power plant. The plant is proposed to be expanded to 1360MW.Land compensation was given to farmers in June last year. A notification of formal acquisition was issued before we went ahead with the process. Vivek said compensation has been provided as per the norms of the state government.The ambitious project was proposed to be expanded to 1360MW eight years ago, but land acquisition was key constraint. NTPC carried out preliminary studies in 2006 for expansion of the project. The company had said accommodating different unit configurations would not be feasible until more area was acquired for the project. Subsequently, the aspect of availability of additional area adjacent to the existing 440MW plant was explored."

NAGPUR: A WhatsApp image of an important place of worship being desecrated hurt the sentiments of a community celebrating its holy month, sparking communal tension in Mominpura and leading to arson and stone pelting on Central Avenue on Friday. The incident was brought under control soon as cops swung into action.The city police were jolted awake when hordes of agitators started lighting fire to straw heaps at Dosar Bhavan Square. The angry mob started pelting stones before the cops could disperse them after the sudden flare-up. Some protesters also tried to hurl burning material on shops across the road and target the nearby petrol pump.Traffic cops at the North Zone office, near Bhagwagar chowk, were the first to react. The cops did well to douse the lit straw heaps on the road immediately. They also foiled a bid by agitators to set the petrol pump on fire, which would have triggered a massive blaze leading to unprecedented damage in the densely populated localities on either side of Central Avenue.It's learnt that an image was downloaded from Facebook and circulated on WhatsApp among a particular group. The image reached a group member from Mominpura, who showed the objectionable matter to the rest of the community members.The angry citizens first rushed to Tehsil police station, where the cops on duty failed to convince the community members that action would be taken. The cops had accepted the complaint but told the community members that the matter would be referred to the cyber crime cell of crime branch to gather concrete evidence against the mischief mongers.Failing to see concrete action, the angry mob decided to launch a stir and vented their ire by targeting public property and lighting fires on the road. Cops from police control room, Tehsil police station and intelligence agencies rushed to the spot.A strong police picket has been deployed at Bhagwagar and Dosar Bhavan Squares. Patrolling has been intensified at Mominpura.An offence was later registered at Tehsil police station. It is learnt that a first year arts stream student has already been arrested in the case. The youngster is learnt to have sent the first image to a WhatsApp group member residing at Mominpura. Police are trying to nail down other culprits in the case."

MUZAFFARPUR: An angry mob from Bhikhanpur village under Ahiyapur police station set some shops and vehicles in front of SSB camp near SK Medical College Hospital afire and blocked NH-77 and NH-56 for about four hours in protest against the cold-blooded murder of Bhikhanpur PACS president, Garibnath Sah around midnight last night.Ahiyapur police have lodged an FIR against three persons including Surendra Prasad, Ajay Kumar Singh and Guddu Singh on the statement of deceased's son, Sonu Kumar who has alleged that his father has been murdered by all the three persons engaged in property dealings and money lending business. Police sources revealed that Sah was also doing the same business and some differences among them might have led to his murder.Sah's body was recovered near the medical college boundary wall soon after the murder.

The post-mortem examination was done at SKMCH on Tuesday afternoon.As soon as the news of his death reached Bhikhanpur locality, a large number of villagers attacked the house of Guddu Singh and ransacked it. Then, they rushed to the market belonging to another accused, Ajay Kumar Singh and set afire some vehicles and woods kept inside the motor repairing garage, which too is said to be belonging to Ajay. Two four-wheelers and a similar number of motorcycles kept there for repairing or servicing were also burned in the arson. Another mob went to the junction and NH connecting Muzaffarpur to Darbhanga and Sitamarhi and blocked both of them.The mob fury relented only when a policemen led by Town DSP, DSP East and ASP (operations) reached there and convinced the villagers of police action immediately. They assured them that all the three accused named in the FIR would be nabbed as soon as possible.District Chhatra RJD president, Chandan Kumar said the villagers have given a deadline of only 24 hours to the police to arrest the culprits or else a further violence may have disastrous consequences.

NAGPUR: A simmering tension between two powerful families, going back several years, erupted into a bloody war after some members of the Yadav family allegedly shot dead a youngster from the Gupta family at Deolapar, around 65km from Nagpur on Wednesday, triggering a violent reaction.Irked by the murder of 25-year-old Dhanesh Gupta, protesters set afire two police vans and six other vehicles, a house and staged a road blockade for three hours. Due to the protest, Nagpur rural police resorted to a mild lathicharge to control the mob. The situation was tense until late Wednesday night, with unconfirmed reports claiming that a curfew had been clamped in the town near Ramtek.Dhanesh was a building contractor and a Shiv Sena activist. His younger brother Smit was seriously injured in the attack. The incident took place around 4.30pm at Paoni, around 7km from Deolapar.Police arrested main accused Indal Yadav along with his relatives Makhkmal Singh Yadav, Tufan Yadav, Jai Singh Yadv, Premlal Yadav, Sunil Yadav and Nilu Yadav. Cops said that the murder took place over rivalry between the two families, Yadavs and Guptas. The Guptas stay at Deolapar while the Yadavs at Chorbahuli.Police said the powerful families had been trying to control Deolapar and had been at loggerheads for years. There had been several fights between them, resulting in police complaints and counter-complaints even over frivolous issues.It was one such trivial issue that snowballed into Wednesday's mayhem.Dhanesh picked up a quarrel with Indal Yadav over parking of a vehicle in the market area at Paoni in the afternoon. Dhanesh had his office at Paoni while Smit owned a mobile phone store in the same village. After the argument with Yadav, Dhanesh went to Smit's shop. While he was there, a group of people appeared on the scene and fired at him. Smit was also attacked with a sharp weapon. Dhanesh died on the spot.Dhanesh was declared brought dead at a private hospital at Shankar Nagar Square and Smit is undergoing treatment at the same hospital.The firing plunged the area into chaos. Enraged over Dhanesh's death, his relatives and supporters immediately set fire to a part of Yadav's residence at Chorbahuli. Protesters, which sources claimed to be in the thousands, also set afire van of Paoni DySP, a police van at Paoni and six vehicles of the Yadav family at Charbahuli.Police could not reach the murder spot quickly as protesters had staged a road blockade at Paoni and even blocked the road at Deolapar. Though the protesters cleared the road at Paoni, the rasta roko at Deolapar and Paoni continued for hours.Villagers said that the Gupta family members were baying for blood and the Yadavs had gone absconding.Police teams from Bhandara, Nagpur and Parseoni were rushed in to control the situation. Till late night, police were searching for the accused and a tight bandobast was set up at Devlapar and Paoni village.Although sources said that curfew had been imposed in Deolapar, personnel at Nagpur rural police control room denied this. Deolapar senior police inspector A Raghuwanshi didn't respond to phone calls. Nagpur (Rural) SP Aarti Singh said she could not provide further details as she was on leave."

NAGPUR: An irresponsible remark by a cop at Tehsil police station had allegedly triggered the arson and stone pelting at Central Avenue and other places on Friday following circulation of the derogatory WhatsApp image of a prominent religious place. It is learnt, the cop claimed that the senior inspector was sleeping after the aggrieved community members demanded action against the perpetrator for circulating the image.One of the protesters, who had marched to the police station along with his fellow community members, claimed that they were left stunned and also angry at the same time when a cop casually asked them to come after sometime as the senior inspector was taking rest at 4pm.""The PI is sleeping, come later"" is what the Tehsil police station cop is learnt to have told the agitators before turning them away. This sparked off the arson as the agitators decided to vent their ire in public. A reliable source said, ""The community members felt that the police was only wasting time and had no real intention to take action.""Apart from setting bundles of straw heaps and tyres on fire, there were also incidents of stone pelting on public and private vehicles at Dosar Bhavan Chowk. Hordes of agitators also tried to target other establishments on Central Avenue but timely intervention by traffic cops from north chamber on Central Avenue, whose office is located close to Mominpura and Bhaldarpura, thwarted their attempt. Tension had also prevailed in areas under Kotwali police station jurisdiction.Senior PI VS Sanap of Tehsil police station stated that he was present on duty but busy in a probe. ""We told the agitators that their complaint has been referred to the cyber cell. Police were also engaged in tracing the accused who was immediately arrested for forwarding the WhatsApp image to one of the community members staying at Mominpura,"" said Sanap.It is learnt that the accused, a first year Arts student, had downloaded the image from Facebook in his cellphone and was in the process of saving it when it got circulated through WhatsApp. The student has been remanded to police custody for three days after being produced before court on Saturday."

RAIPUR: Facing criticism after CBI indicting policemen for allegedly setting ablaze houses of tribal villagers during an anti-Naxalite operation in 2011, Chhattisgarh government has ordered suspension of seven assistant police officers — former special police officers (SPOs) — against whom the central investigating agency has filed charge-sheets in the court.An official spokesman said late on Wednesday night that Director General of state police has instructed the superintendent of police concerned to suspend/life attach these former Special police officers (SPOs), who were responsible for the burning of houses in three villages Tadmetla, Morpalli and Timmapuram, which is now in tribal Sukma district. These villages were in Dantewada district, which was bifurcated to create new Sukma district.The action comes few days after the CBI indicted Bastar policemen holding them responsible for burning nearly 200 houses of tribal villagers during an anti-Naxalite operation in 2011 and also submitted a status report to the Supreme Court, which was hearing a petition filed by social activists. The CBI has also charged 26 others, including former SPOs and anti-Naxal vigilantes, for attacking social activist Swami Agnivesh and others while they were on their way to Tadmetla to provide relief to the people whose houses were burnt.Political parties, however, are not satisfied with the decision to suspend SPOs, who were later re-named as assistant constables, saying that the government should have fixed responsibility on senior police officers, on whose orders such operation was carried out in the villages. Veteran Communist Party of India (CPI) leader Chhittaranjan Bakshi told TOI “Bastar’s Inspector general of police SRP Kalluri, who was SSP of Dantewada at the time of incident, had went public saying that the operation was carried out under his guidance”. He demanded immediate suspension and arrest of Bastar IG.Opposition Congress state Chief Bhupesh Baghel has been demanding suspension of Bastar IG SRP Kalluri saying that there has been numerous incidents of blatant human rights violations in Bastar, including the police implicating social activists, political workers in false cases."

TABGHA,ISRAEL: A suspected arson attack overnight damaged a revered shrine in northern Israel where Christians believe Jesus performed a miracle, and police briefly detained 16 young Jewish settlers over the incident Thursday.The Church of the Multiplication at Tabgha, on the shores of the Sea of Galilee, is where many Christians believe Jesus fed the 5,000 in the miracle of the five loaves and two fish.Some 5,000 people visit the site each day, and Israeli President Reuven Rivlin called the incident a ""terrible desecration of an ancient and holy place of prayer.""A church adviser blamed Jewish extremists for the incident and police later said they had detained 16 youths from settlements in the occupied West Bank for questioning.""In an area near the church, 16 youths were detained for investigation in order to check their involvement in the incident before dawn,"" police spokeswoman Luba Samri said in a statement.She said 10 of those detained were from Yitzhar, which is known as a bastion of extremists and where some residents have been involved in previous hate crimes.However, Samri said later that the youths had been released without charge after providing statements to the authorities.A member of the Roman Catholic Benedictine order, which manages the site, said one of the buildings within the compound was completely destroyed in the blaze but the church itself was not damaged.Hebrew graffiti was found on another building within the complex, reading ""Idols will be cast out"" or destroyed, an AFP correspondent reported. The text is part of a common Jewish prayer.Two people who were in the compound at the time were treated for smoke inhalation, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told AFP, saying there was ""a strong possibility"" the fire was deliberate.Father Matthias said an external atrium was ""totally destroyed"" in the blaze.""The church, thank God, is in good condition,"" he told AFP. ""We're very happy that nothing happened to the church.""Wadie Abu Nasser, an adviser to the Roman Catholic Church in the Holy Land, said the apparent arson attack would reverberate throughout the Christian world.""Israel's global image will be harmed,"" he told Israeli public radio. ""When you put one and one together, between the graffiti and the arson, you can reach a conclusion regarding the potential suspects.""Tabgha was subjected to a previous attack in April 2014 in which church officials said a group of religious Jewish teenagers had damaged crosses and attacked clergy.There has been a long line of attacks on Christian and Muslim holy places in both Israel and the West Bank, in which the perpetrators are believed to have been Jewish extremists.""I absolutely condemn such acts,"" deputy foreign minister Tzipi Hotovely said in a statement.Rivlin called the head of the Benedictine order in Israel to express his concern over the incident at the site, which is expected to be closed over the next three days.The site is owned by the German Roman Catholic Church, and Berlin's envoy to Israel Andreas Michaelis said he was ""shocked"" by the incident.""I strongly condemn this attack and every form of violence"" against places of worship or people working in them, he said in a statement.""Religious institutions must be as well protected in Israel as they are in Germany and Europe."""

The frequency of the fires, lack of conclusive evidence to prove the cause of fire was accidental, and the damage caused, all point to the likelihood that combustion is usually not spontaneous, say activists.Citing past fires, they say the huts could have been ravaged with tacit assent of the authorities for purposes such as road widening or large infrastructure projects that are blocked by the slums. Others allege that slum dwellers themselves sometimes set fire to their huts to get compensation from the government.Data available with TOI has revealed that 61 slum fires were reported in the city since 2010. They left 11 people dead and caused losses of more than 33 lakh. A member of a fact-finding team that visited several slum accident sites in the city, A Marx, of the People’s Union for Human Rights, said the authorities are often behind the slum fires. “They do this to make way for infrastructure projects. If slum dwellers people resist eviction agencies will find ways to clear the slums. But there had been no proper investigation to find the causes of these fire accidents,” he said.For instance, he says, nearly 100 huts were gutted in a fire in Vyasarpadi three years ago. “A bridge now stands where the huts once were,” he said. “Many slum dwellers staying along the banks of the Cooum were forced to move out because of frequent slum fires. The proposed Port-Maduravoyal expressway will pass the area they have evacuated,” Marx said. “There should be a judicial probe to find the facts.”Slum dwellers say that lose important documents like ration cards in fire accidents. “I can’t get free rice from ration shops any more,” said Saroja, who lives in the Ambedkar Nagar slum near Udayam Theatre in Ashok Nagar. The slum, abutting K K Nagar, was devastated by a fire last August.However, census figures reveal that there are more slum dwellers in the city than before, appearing to undermine the activists’ theory. Around 28.5% of Chennai’s population lived in slums in 2011 as compared to 17.7% in 2001.Sources said that there many ‘slumlords’ are even renting out huts for poor people for more than 2000 per month in areas like Malligaipu Nagar slum near the Adyar, Ururkuppam slum near Besant Nagar and Srinavasapuram.Tamil Nadu fire and rescue service deputy director S Vijayasekar says the department says the lanes in slums are too narrow for fire tenders to enter, making it difficult to combat a blaze. Officials had identified 30 fire-prone slums near KK Nagar, Thiruvanmiyur, Mylapore, Teynampet, Saidapet, Vyasarpadi, Esplanade, Tondiarpet, Royapuram, Kilpauk, Koyambedu and Villivakkam.Vijayasekar says the department does not investigate fire accidents. “We fight the fire and the police conduct a probe. But we always maintain a fire report, which contains the cause of the blaze. If there is anything suspicious, police should conduct a thorough investigation.”Experts say the government should provide slum dwellers with fire-proof houses. “There are too many fire accidents in slums each year, but the government has not done anything to rehabilitate the slum dwellers,” said Vanessa Peter, policy researcher of Information and Resource Centre for the Deprived Urban Communities."

MYSORE: The arson attack on a family of seven, including five children, has orphaned the children with the death of their parents in a span of 24 hours. Their mother died on Thursday.A day after their plumber-father Afzal Pasha aka Babu, 33, died on Wednesday, the children, who are undergoing treatment for burns, lost their mother Shereen Taj , 27.Taj's brother Abdul Kudos told TOI: ""We are yet to decide on the future of the kids. The boys, aged between 4 and 9 years, are being treated at KR Hospital , and, according to doctors, the condition of two of them is critical. We, the relatives of the couple, are attending to them.""Afzal Pasha, his wife Sheree Taj and five of his sons were set on fire at his house by his money-lenders in the wee hours of Monday.Majority of the families living in areas like Ghousia Nagar, Shanthinagara, K N Pura, RajivNagara, Beedi Colony and Kalyanagirinagara in the north east of Mysore are caught in the tangled financial web and suffering in the hands of private financiers.Majority of the residents living in this region are working in unorganized sectors and involved in menial jobs like beedi and incense stick rolling besides working as daily wagers to eke out living. Some of them are into scrap dealing, vending of fruits, vegetables and plastic materials.They take loans for high rate of interest on daily and weekly basis to do business and quarrel over loan repayment is common in these localities.Haseena, a homemaker, claimed that every day there will be quarrel in her locality - K N Pura over financial matters. But none in the locality go to the rescue of others fearing repercussion. Even in case of Afzal's family there was fight between his lenders and the family a week ago. Zenath, another homemaker, claimed both Afzal and Shereen lived like an ideal couple but their only mistake, I think, was borrowing money for high interest.Former mayor Ayub Khan admits lending money for interest to people in the region is prevalent and is dangerous development. Ayub appeals cops to check this menace which can cause law and order problem.SDPI leader Abdul Majeed says the practice of lending money on daily interest rate is in existence in north east of Mysore. Money lenders take 20 pc interests from their borrowers every day. For instance, if they give them Rs 80 on the morning the borrower has to pay Rs 100 on the evening.The root cause for such illegal practice is lack of financial support to poor people and minorities. According to me, Karnataka Minority Development Corporation has failed to facilitate loans to all those involved in micro businesses like beedi and incense stick rolling. At least now government should take serious note of it, he said."

NEW DELHI: Delhi Police is conducting a security audit of juvenile homes following the repeated arson and rioting reported from these facilities. Sources told TOI that a special commissioner of police is monitoring the scrutiny and an official from the Armed Police of the rank of DCP has been designated nodal officer for the audit.His task is to coordinate with the government, welfare officers and judiciary for collation and assessment of data.Although police refused to share details, sources said they are looking at measures like deploying policemen outside homes to catch fleeing juveniles in case of a jailbreak. They are planning to create a database of juveniles in each jail so they can be tracked in event of escape. However, legal ramifications of such a step must be explored.A juvenile delinquent had fled the home last year and committed the brazen robbery and murder of a jeweller's wife in Mayur Vihar. Police got a tip-off about his involvement but were helpless as they had no record of his previous locations.The audit is part of government initiatives taken up to ensure better security at juvenile homes. The high court had pulled up Delhi government on several occasions asking for swift steps to ensure law and order at these shelters.A HC committee also visited the home after the incidents and reported that the minors had been protesting against the awful conditions of the home which included open sewers, broken walls and bad quality food.It had also observed that the juveniles in these homes had little access to constructive activities.Segregation is an area of concern. In most of the cases, it was found there is a set of children involved who are influencing other minors to break the law.Police plan to create a database of these children as they believe if they can be segregated it will solve most of the problems. An officer said the focus of the nodal officer should be to have maximum complaints addressed so that retaining these children is no more a challenge.""Children complain of being confined inside four walls which gives rise to the desire to escape. If they are allowed to remain in the playgrounds for more time, it may help. Sewa Kutir has a big playground but inmates report they are not allowed to spend more than an hour there daily,"" said an officer.Plans are also underway to revamp the vocational training modules so that these may attract more delinquents."

BEIJING: A former prison inmate in China intentionally set fire to a bus so that he could return to jail where food and accommodation are provided.The 60-year-old homeless man was sentenced to four years in prison recently by a local court for setting the bus ablaze.The man surnamed Wang said he committed the crime as he wanted to return to prison to avail the facilities of food and accommodation, China Daily quoted Beijing Times as reporting.Wang, who boarded a bus in Beijing's Fengtai district in August, last year, set fire to the driver's seat, causing panic among the passengers.Wang has been detained seven times for stealing and fighting in public and was once sentenced to 14 years in jail for robbery, the report said.He reportedly confessed that life out of prison without a fixed residence or relative support made him miss his time in jail."

AHMEDABADVastrapurShankar SoniPanchamVastrapur Vastrapur police said that Shankar's son Vasant Soni often fought with him over property ownership. On Tuesday afternoon, Vasant again fought with his father and in a fit of rage broke window panes in the house. This shocked Shankar whose health took a turn for worse and he had to be admitted into a hospital.""Vasant, according to his neighbours, is addicted to alcohol and often fought with his wife Sushma too. She left him six months back,"" said Vastrapur police officials.At 8 pm on Tuesday, Shankar was discharged from the hospital. But, when he returned home Vasant started fighting with him again. This time he set furniture, bedsheets and other household stuff on fire. Hearing the commotion and then seeing flames inside the house, neighbours rushed in to aid and doused the fire.Later, Dharmendra Patel, chairman of the housing society, registered a complaint with Vastrapur police station against Vasant. In his complaint Patel also alleged that Vasant had harassed several society members in the past. Vasant was soon arrested.In Kanbha too a watchman and his wife were bludgeoned and stabbed to death by their son. The murder, police later said, was over a property dispute.

The killer couple's daughter Sangita used to live with her grandparents. They had tried to kill Sangita too but she survived."

FAIZABAD/TANDA: Indefinite curfew was imposed in Tanda town of Ambedkarnagar district after an angry mob, allegedly activists of Hindu Yuva Vahini , resorted to arson and rioting in protest against murder of their local leader who was shot dead on Sunday late night. About a dozen persons of a community and police personnel were injured. The rioters also torched several houses and vehicles. Police had to fire in air to control the mob.Hindu Yuva Vahini is a group founded and led by Gorakhpur BJP MP Yogi Aditya Nath . In Tanda town of Ambedkarnar district, Hindu Yuva Vahini's local leader Ram Babu Gupta was shot dead by motorcycle-borne miscreants in the busy market of Adalatpur locality on Sunday night. Police said that Gupta was killed over a property related dispute. The assailants, however, have not been arrested so far.Irked over the manner in which Ram Babu was shot in the middle of a busy market place and assailants made good their escape unchallenged after committing the crime, supporters of the slain leader went berserk. Delay on the part of the local police in reaching the crime scene after the murder added fuel to the already rising tempers of the supporters, who attacked and manhandled the policemen and set afire a police jeep.The situation turned ugly when the Vahini activists gave the incident a communal angle. It was only after additional police force reached the site and chased away the mob that the situation was brought under control. Police said efforts were on to trace the assailants and work out the case. Body of the Vahini leader was subsequently sent for the post-mortem and a case of murder was lodged at Aliganj police station.As a precautioary measure, the district administration imposed curfew in Tanda and Aliganj police stations of the Tanda area. Heavy police force has also been deployed in the area. Faizabad Commissioner Vipin Kumar Diwedi when contacted, told TOI that the situation was now under control. Subhash Chandra, Inspector General of Police, said that the police are investigating the murder case and riots have been controlled."

KOLKATA: Pushed to the wall after arresting pest controller Jyotirmoy Nandi for alleged “arson” at Writers’ Buildings, the Mamata Banerjee government is now trying to nail publications registrar Bismoy Roy who gave Nandi a clean chit the other day.Hare Street police, in their report to the state administration, have made out a case against Roy. Secretariat sources hinted that he has been held responsible in a report submitted by joint secretary (home) Debashis Guha Thakurata as well.The police report — vetted by senior officers at Lalbazar — states that Nandi was engaged without a valid agreement. “The firm that Nandi works with had an agreement with the state government from 2007 to 2010. The publications department engaged Nandi long after the expiry of the agreement. Second, procedure demands that the official should have taken permission from public works and agriculture departments before engaging the firm for spraying pesticides. Roy didn’t follow the procedure,” said an officer.This apart, Roy should have informed the officer in charge of Writers’ before admitting someone with highly inflammable kerosene in a high security zone, the officer pointed out. “Finally, both Roy and Nandi have to explain why kerosene beyond the prescribed amount was used to prepare the pesticide solution,” an investigating officer said.Probe revealed that Nandi didn’t have the required photo identity card for entering the high security zone. According to Roy, Nandi entered Writers’ under the supervision of a publications employee who used to escort him so that he didn’t move around the building.The reason seems obvious. Police officers — who sprung to action after none other than home secretary Basudeb Banerjee cried conspiracy — have to justify their actions.According to state officials, Roy was under the scanner for quite some time after he gave a clean chit to IPS officer Nazrul Islam’s controversial book Musalmader Ki Karaniya. Nazrul cited this while fighting his case in the Central Administrative Tribunal ( CAT ) that ordered a stay on the departmental proceedings against the IPS officer.Roy’s track record, along with findings of the Hare Street police fuelled speculation that the administration is going to serve a showcause notice on him. The police report has also come handy to the state government to plead its case against the pest controller whose arrest has met with a flutter in administrative circles.Police officers at Lalbazar are in two minds over the legal strategy the state should adopt when Nandi is produced at Bankshall court on Friday. The public prosecutor will thus have to wait from a last minute directive from the administration on whether to oppose Nandi’s bail petition based on the police report or remain silent as the public prosecutor did when accused former CEO of Siliguri-Jalpaiguri Development Authority (SJDA) Godala Kiran Kumar moved his bail plea despite having non-bailable charges on him.The public prosecutor may name “other conspirators” (read Bismoy Roy) when the case comes up for hearing on Friday, say sources.Jyotirmoy’s mother Chitra Nandi isn’t willing to pay heed to the legal nitty-gritty. All she wants is to get her son back home. Chitra couldn’t suppress her emotion. “He cried every time we went to visit him. It is piercing my heart ,” the mother said."

HOWRAH: Pest controller Jyotirmoy Nandi , who was taken into custody on charges of conspiracy to set the Writers’ Buildings on fire, is innocent, said a state government official.Nandi had been hired by the government in 2007. This fact came to light after registrar of publications department Bismoy Roy did the plain speak and ruled out the conspiracy saying that Nandi was simply doing his job in the presence of a government employee.Registrar of publications department held that Nandi is innocent. “I know that Nandi is innocent. I have been in this department for the last nine years and Nandi has been working here as a pest controller before that. According to the terms of contract, he comes once in a month. I have spoken to the home secretary on this matter and have also said the same to the police. Nandi is honest and the police should release him if they do not find anything against him,” Roy said on Wednesday.Sources in the detective department said that investigators are under pressure from the higher ups to take quick action on the matter. Police, however, wondered how Nandi could enter the high security zone without an identity card.On Wednesday, Nandi’s mother and sister went to the Calcutta high court to consult a lawyer before calling on the investigating officer at Hare Street police station.According to Nandi’s family, who lives at Hooghly ’s Serampore, after Nandi returned home on Friday evening, a call came from Hare street police station asking him to turn up at the police station on Saturday.Jyotirmoy Nandi was arrested on Saturday on charges of pouring kerosene on the files."

LUCKNOW: Police on Tuesday filed FIR against five accused including three senior police officials in Congress leader Rita Bahuguna Joshi's house arson incident.The police acted on the orders of chief judicial magistrate and all five accused were booked under various IPC sections. Interestingly, the original order that was given by the CJM in October got lost before it reached the Hussainganj police station. The copy of the original order landed at the police station on Tuesday on the basis of which the case was registered against cops. Congressmen had alleged at that time that the police was in collusion with the mob and stood as mere spectators instead of providing protection to the victims.While Babloo and Abdi had been chargesheeted in the past, FIR against Balram Saroj (the then in-charge of Hussainganj police station), BS Ghabrial (then circle officer of Hazratganj) and Harish Kumar (then SP east) was registered on Tuesday. In July 2009, Joshi had made some remarks against then chief minister Mayawati. Angry supporters of Mayawati led by controversial leaders Jitendra Singh alias Babloo and Intezar Ahmed Abdi vandalised and torched Joshi's house, located in high-security zone."

NEW DELHI: Alleging a conspiracy behind the fire at St Sebastian’s Church in Dilshad Garden , representatives of the city’s Christian community have decided to stage a protest outside Delhi Police headquarters on Tuesday. They said the fire at the church resulted from arson, not a short-circuit, and was an attempt to polarize voters before the Delhi elections.“We will stage a protest against the office of the police commissioner on Tuesday morning to focus attention on attempts to polarize people in Delhi, which goes to the polls soon,” said Dr John Dayal , a former member of National Integration Council of India and All India Christian Council . He added that there is a history of attacks against Christian places of worship in areas like Janakpuri and Trilokpuri.Christian representatives see Monday’s fire as part of a pattern of violence against the minority community. “On Sunday, two house churches were attacked in Annupur district of Madhya Pradesh. In several districts of Chhattisgarh, village panchayats have passed regulations against non-Hindu prayers under political influence,” said Father Savarimuthu.Several politicians visited the church on Monday. Area MP, BJP’s Manoj Tiwari, was among the first to arrive. He said he had come straight from Parliament to assess the situation and prepare a report. AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal followed. “Such acts are deliberate. If they’re being done just before elections to influence votes, I’m sure Delhiites will not accept those behind them. I have asked the police commissioner to take action,” said Kejriwal.Delhi BJP released a statement condemning the incident. “Christians are our growing partners in national development, a proof of which is the large number of our Christian MLAs in Goa…We cannot rule out some political mischief too,” the statement read.Congress attacked BJP for police’s lethargic response to the fire. “Instead of playing politics on a sensitive issue like this, the authorities should act swiftly to prevent a communal flare-up,” said Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee chief Arvinder Singh."

KOLKATA: It took 24 hours and 26

to douse the flames at the Maheshtala

that caught

at 6pm on Thursday. The incident not only shocked the neighbourhood, but also rendered many homeless.

Police said the warehouse belonged to the customs and confiscated goods were stored in it. Though the cause of the fire was not yet known, investigators have not ruled out arson.

It took a 24 hour firefight to douse the flames at the

that caught fire around 6 p.m. on Thursday, leaving the neighbourhood puzzled, tense and many homeless.

Fire raged throughout Thursday night at the warehouse which was packed with inflammable materials. Twenty-six fire tenders were pressed into action to bring the blaze under control. Such was the intensity of the fire, that it spread to a studio next door. Actors and technicians had a narrow escape as they were evacuated on time.

Panic gripped the residents of the area as well and they ran out of their houses in fear. ""We really got scared. The flames were nearly five-storey high and it seemed that the fire would devour everything. as the flames appeared to be all-devouring and nearly five stories high. Our apartment is next to the warehouse. So we did not take any risk and got out of our house with whatever we could lay our hands on. We spent the night under the open sky,"" said Biswa Kalyan Banerjee, a resident of an apartment next to the warehouse.

Banerjee, however, claimed that as he moved back to his apartment on Friday afternoon, some items were

from his house. Tarak Banik and Iman Roy had similar complaints.

As many as 26 fire-tenders were deployed. The number of tenders at the spot gradually came down as the intensity of the fire declined with time. Packed with inflammable materials, the warehouse on Santoshpur Road remained ablaze throughout Thursday night.

""We really got scared as the flames appeared to be all-devouring and nearly five stories high. Our apartment is next to the warehouse. So we did not take any risk and got out of our house with whatever, we could lay our hands on. We spent the night under the open sky,"" said Biswa Kalyan Banerjee, a resident of an apartment next to the warehouse.

There was unbearable heat and smoke that engulfed the entire area. There was a studio next to the warehouse. The fire sparked a panic there. People started running out of the studio. A number of locals also joined hands with the fire brigade for dousing the flame.

Maheshtala police said the warehouse belonged to the customs and was used for storage of confiscated goods. They mainly keep the confiscated goods in those warehouses.

While two security personnel guarded the warehouse, a supervisor came for periodic checks.

""We were having a tea break, when the godown caught fire. Within moments it became a huge flame,"" said Asmad Sheikh, one of the guards who called the fire brigade.

Fire tenders, however, had a tough time accessing the warehouse through narrow lanes. Fire minister Javed Khan, municipal affairs minister Firhad Hakim and mayor Sovan Chatterjee rushed to the spot.

The cause of the fire, however, is still not known. ""Possibly, a short-circuit might have caused the fire. But we are not ruling out arson,"" said an investigator.

""The lease rent of the warehouse is 75 paise per square feet, while the current market price is Rs 15 per square feet. So the owner of the warehouse wanted a revision of the lease rent. The

value of the area has also skyrocketted. So we are not ruling out the arson theory,"" said another investigator.

Tarak Banik, Iman Roy and Kamal Banerjee complained that as they moved back to their apartments on Friday afternoon, they found many things were missing from their houses."

The government has already sent five companies of central forces to Darjeeling anticipating trouble as the GJM enforces the indefinite strike from Saturday to renew its Gorkhaland movement.The GJM, which sent a delegation led by general secretary Roshan Giri to New Delhi on Friday for statehood talks, denied any involvement in arson attacks that defaced the exquisite forest bungalow in the picturesque Takdah cantonment, where chief minister Mamata Banerjee stayed earlier this year while on a trip to Darjeeling. A VIP room and the dining hall were gutted.The guest house and range office in nearby Rimbick were also set ablaze but officials managed to put out the flames before they could cause serious damage.

Complaints of vandalism in the tourist retreats of Rangli Rangliat and Rimbick-Lodhoma were also filed with the police. A GJM supporter was arrested. Miscreants also torched a vehicle in which NHPC officials were travelling at Mungpo.The panic exodus on Friday morning after the overnight attacks prompted Writers’ Buildings to issue a diktat to officials to stay put. Home secretary Basudeb Banerjee ordered district magistrates and police chiefs in the region to provide security to government employees and step up vigil around state-owned properties and installations.“I was informed about some miscreants setting fire to Takdah guest house at 12.30am yesterday. I immediately informed the fire brigade and police station and reached the guest house. A VIP room and the dining hall were completely damaged but we managed to save other infrastructure,” said B R Sewa, the Darjeeling DFO.Police said raids were on to nab the vandals. “We have arrested one person in connection with the torching of the police camp, who has confessed to the crime.

NAGPUR: Tension erupted in Ganjipeth locality in the wee hours of Sunday after a local mechanic and transporter was brutally murdered over a property dispute . Nearby residents ransacked offices and a couple of vehicles belonging to the Baksh brothers, who have been arrested for the murder of Naushad Alam Khan Mistry , on Umred Road. The accused, Zakhir and Arif Baksh were nabbed red-handed while committing the murder by cops on night patrolling duty.The Baksh brothers have been booked for murder on earlier occasions too. It is learnt that the Baksh brothers, said to be close to some policemen in Ganeshpeth police station, are involved in criminal activities. Local residents of Ganjipeth said the Baksh brothers are involved in extortion rackets apart from their regular work of taking contracts for vacating disputed properties.Though property dispute is being cited as the motive behind the murder, police are not eliminating the possibility of it being a supari or contract killing.Naushad, father of two, is a partner of a garage unit at Ganjipeth. He is also learnt to be holding property rights to a piece of land behind his garage. This piece of land worth around Rs7 crore has been the cause of several disputes among partners.Police said that Naushad had gone to load material at his transport company office at Hasanbagh main road, where he is a partner. While he was returning along with another man, the Baksh brothers intercepted his scooter. The brothers, who came in a car, started stabbing him. They were smashing Naushad's head with a stone when cops reached the place and nabbed the assailants. It is learnt that another hard-core goon, who was with the Baksh brothers, fled the place.On January 1, Naushad had a tiff with Sheikh Iliyas and his brother Nazir after a concrete slab fell on a car belonging to Naushad's customer, damaging the vehicle. Iliyas's son Ijaz is learnt to have attacked Naushad with a sharp weapon, leaving him injured.Ganeshpeth police opted to take the matter lightly and settled it without taking any stringent steps. Several local residents claimed the murder would have been averted if Ganeshpeth police had taken strict action.Naushad's kin allege that Iliyas and his family must have urged the Baksh brothers to eliminate him. The murder could have been planned to teach Naushad a lesson for arguing with Iliyas's family, and pave the way to acquire the disputed land behind his garage.Senior officers from Sakkardara police station, within whose limits the murder took place, claimed that Baksh brothers have named Iliyas and his family members for their involvement in the murder. Their claims are being verified now. Producing them before the court, the cops procured custody of the Baksh brothers till January 10."

FAIZABAD/LUCKNOW: There was no escalation of violence despite two cases of arson and the situation in Faizabad remained tense but under control on Friday. While the first case of arson was reported from Phulwari village in Bhadarsa area of the district, miscreants set four shops on fire at around 11 pm in the curfew-bound Sadar area despite the presence of heavy police force.

Two persons were killed and over a dozen injured in the violence on the

day evening on Wednesday. While religious leaders appealed the people to maintain peace and harmony, the state govermment announced that it was examining if there was any laxity on parts of district magistrate (DM) and police chief in containing the trouble.

""On the request of the administration, the members of the minority community have also agreed to offer Eid-ul-Zuha prayer on Saturday in their respective areas instead of having a congregation at Eidgah -- as it is normally done on the auspicious occasion -- as a precautionary measure and to help the administration keep things under control in view of tense situation,"" said DM Deepak Agarwal. Even on Friday, curfew was relaxed for some time during the day allowing Muslims to offer prayers in mosques in their respective localities. Curfew would also be relaxed for prayers on Saturday.

As many as 26 persons have been arrested in connection with the violence from different parts of the district and 13 FIR s registered so far. Apart from heavy posse of civil police, several companies of

(PAC) and

(RAF) have also been deployed in the sensitive areas. The district administration has also appealed to the people to cooperate with the police and not to get swayed by rumours.

Although officers of Faizabad district administration said that they were taking all possible measures to keep situation under control, their role is also under scanner following complaints that delayed administrative and police response was responsible for aggravating the crisis. In Lucknow, Inspector General, Law and Order, BP Singh told reporters ""We will review the role of DM and SP of Faizabad and action will be taken it they were found guilty of laxity."" He also said that the DM had been asked to collect details about the shops that were set ablaze by the mob during violence, so that their owners could be compensated.

In Lucknow, addressing reporters, Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Jawwad said that incidents of communal violence indicated complete failure of the police and local administration. He produced some locals from Faizabad who claimed that tension was prevailing since the idols of Devkaali temples were stolen. Though the idols were recovered later, situation continued to be tense. ""Had the district administration deployed enough force on the day of idol immersion and reacted timely to resolve the dispute, the violence could have been averted,"" said Uttam sharma of Rashtriya Pragatisheel Morcha. Mahant Janmejay of the Shree Janki Ghaat in Ayodhya said that the free-for-all lasted for more than two hours but there was no one to check it. ""People known to me who live in Faizabad's Chowk area have told me that police were nowhere to be seen when all this was going on,"" he said.

However BJP's former Ayodhya MP Vinay Katiyar said that the outbreak of violence amply demonstrated a total failure of the state government. He said tension had been brewing in the city for quite some time but the administration did not take prevention measures. Several prominent saints of Ayodhya, including Janmejay Sharan, Kaushal Kishor Das, Ram Tahal Sharan and Anjani Sharan also condemned the incident and appealed for peace and harmony.

On the other hand, expressing concern over the violence, UP Congress chief and MP from Faizabad Nirmal Khatri said that it was a pre-planned move to disrupt the peace and harmony in the city. However, BJP Lalji Tandon, also MP from Lucknow, said that policy of ""appeasement"" of the

government was damaging the atmosphere of brotherhood and amity in the state. He also claimed that he was not allowed by the district authorities to go to Faziabad. The newly appointed president of

Munna Singh Chauhan also held the district administration responsible for the violence

The state government has suspended city magistrate Tilakdhari Yadav and station house officer of Kotwali city police station Bhullan Yadav. Surendra Kumar, city magistrate of Rae Bareli, has been posted in the same capacity in Faizabad."

A district administration officer was also attacked by the mob, compelling the police to fire teargas shells.Muchahary also criticized police officials of opening fire against protestors who opposed the “arbitrary” arrest of 65 persons, alleging that the firing was unprovoked. “When the people tried to protest against the arbitrary arrest of 65 people, police opened fired in the air, which was unprovoked. We condemn the firing,” Muchahary said.ICITP-NEZ has appealed to all communities in to help bring peace in the violence-hit BTC areas.Jebra Ram Muchahary | ICITP-NEZ presidentVillagers were rounded up at around 2.30pm at the spot where the car was set ablaze.

NEW DELHI: They had been best friends for the past 12 years until they decided to go on a foreign holiday. One was the head of a successful interior design firm while the other owned an auto spare-parts business in Dehradun. They are residents of Greater Kailash and Rajouri Garden and socialized with each other’s families. But a minor financial dispute led to a saga of enmity that saw envy, anger and hate distort their friendship into something unrecognizable.An insult led to the interior designer allegedly kidnapping the businessman’s son. Even when the matter was “amicably” settled by common friends, the decorator’s anger refused to be assuaged. He went ahead and set his former friend’s godown in Rohtak, and his cars, on fire. It was finally left to the AATS unit of Delhi Police crime branch to nab the interior designer along with two accomplices.“In 2009, Sandeep and Kunal, along with their families, went to Mauritius for a summer vacation. On their return to Delhi, the two friends had a fight over money in which the businessman insulted his friend Kunal, interior designer. Incensed, Kunal nurtured a grudge against Sandeep,’’ said Ashok Chand, DCP (crime).Kunal allegedly took his cousin Nitin Chopra, alias Mani, and his friend Sahil, alias Gola, into confidence. “The trio hatched a conspiracy and kidnapped Sandeep’s nine-year-old son in March 2010 and demanded Rs 1 crore and a luxury car as ransom. But under pressure from family members and the police, the boy was rescued and the complainant agreed not to pursue the matter.“Kunal continued to nurse a grudge. He was upset that Sandeep and his brothers earned crores of rupees each year whereas his own business was struggling. Soon he hit upon a plan and again sought the help of Nitin and Sahil. On December 9, 2010, while Sandeep and his family had gone to Shirdi, Kunal along with his associates went to Sandeep’s godown on Rohtak Road and set the place and a car on fire,’’ said additional DCP (crime) Sanjay Bhatia.Kunal observed that even after Sandeep’s property was damaged, his business continued to flourish. On May 9, 2011 Kunal, along with his associates, set Sandeep’s Innova on fire. Kunal was under the impression that after this series of unfortunate events, Sandeep and his brother, whom he thought to be a submissive person by nature, would capitulate and he would be able to extract crores of rupees from them. But the brothers approached the police.A case in this regard was registered at Greater Kailash police station. But when the complainant continued to receive threats and demands for money, the probe was transferred to the crime branch.Following a minor financial dispute in 2009, Kunal started hating his friend, Sandeep, so much that he first kidnapped his friend’s son and later burnt a factory that Sandeep owned."

NEW DELHI: Around 50 boys rioted inside a north Delhi juvenile observation home for eight hours on Saturday night, torching down the superintendent’s office and triggering blasts by setting fire to gas cylinders . In the melee, 22 boys escaped. By Sunday, 15 had been nabbed.Police said a hunt was on for the seven still at large, who are involved in cases of robbery, dacoity and snatching.Eyewitnesses and government officials said the scale and ferocity of Saturday’s violence hadn’t previously been seen at any juvenile facility in Delhi. The boys were on a rampage through the night at the Adharshila observation home inside Seva Kutir , a juvenile home at Mukherjee Nagar, northwest Delhi, even as a posse of 200 policemen watched as bystanders.“They destroyed computers in the offices, furniture, water-coolers, medicines and records/files stored inside the room. A massive solar heater on the roof was sent crashing to the ground. After climbing the high security walls, they ransacked my office, used the electric wiring to start a fire and escaped. Our TIP room has been completely burnt. The loss runs into lakhs,” said Anil Kumar , superintendent of the Adharshila home.Before they burnt down the offices, the boys pulled out a cemented cash chest attached to the wall, broke open the locks and took away Rs 35,000 cash, according to the staffers who maintain the office . Most of the boys are over 16 but less than 18 years of age. The home had 128 boys.Eyewitnesses said it was a miracle the staff escaped unhurt. A posse of nearly 200 policemen apart from private security and personnel of Delhi Armed Police witnessed the rioting inside as bystanders. While eight DAP policemen and 21 private security guards were present when the rioting began, by 2.30am reinforcements from Mukherjee Nagar police station had arrived but could offer little help. They cited the rules in the Juvenile Justice Act and orders of the court to justify their hands off approach.“We can’t even lathi-charge them. Why would a policeman or guard endanger his life in trying to stop a mob of juveniles?” explained a DAP guard posted outside the home. Women and child development minister Kiran Walia expressed concern over a series of incidents in the government-run juvenile homes and said she had ordered a full report on Saturday’s incident. “Once I get the report, we will be in a better position to understand what happened,” she said.When TOI visited the office compound and the observation home adjacent to it, the area resembled a riot zone. It was strewn with burnt paper, blankets, bricks, iron rods and stones. The agitated boys got hold of anything, from blankets to newspapers and photo albums, to light up a fire damaging corrugated iron doors used for entrance and exit by the staffers. A guitar snapped in half lay as a testimony to the violence. Small offices inside the home were severely damaged while half-burnt cylinders reeked of gas.In the past two months, this is the third time juveniles have rioted and attempted to flee from homes run by the women and child development department of the Delhi government. On August 10, the Majnu Ka Tila juvenile home witnessed the first such case followed by the next incident at Sewa Kutir, Mukherjee Nagar on August 28, which again saw violence on Saturday. Police believe it is the same set of boys who instigated the violence. After the ruckus at Majnu Ka Tila, 10 inmates were shifted to Mukherjee Nagar, from where five escaped on August 28. These boys are suspects in the latest episode too.According to the staff and guards, trouble began around 8.30pm on Saturday when a group of juveniles reached the terrace of the observation home and started pelting stones, bricks, even earthen pots at the private security guards inside and DAP policemen outside. Emboldened by the lack of resistance from the security staff, the boys scaled the boundary wall with the help of ladders and ropes even as a section targeted the canteen to grab hold of LPG cylinders inside. “We could only watch helplessly as they first threw down the cylinders from the roof. Some of them climbed down and set fire to the cylinders. The blasts were deafening and we ran for cover,” recalled a worker at the home.Rakesh Kumar Yadav, welfare officer posted at the home said some of the boys leading the rampage kept instigating the others to join them. “Some of the boys unhinged the massive water heater installed on the roof and threw it two floors below. When I reached the spot it was raining bricks and cylinders. I took away more than 70 boys outside the home into the open playground within the compound so that they don’t get hurt. We were very lucky no one was hurt,” Yadav added.Members of National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) and Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) also inspected the damage and spoke to the juveniles. Neena Naik, member NCPCR, admitted to TOI that there were no immediate answers to why Saturday’s violence took place. “They appear to be well looked after. But it seems it is the uncertainty of their future that gets them frustrated. In some cases, they were the sole bread earners for their parents, others are full of energy and want to prosper. We need to put our heads together to examine how this can be prevented. The boys are regularly visited by counselors and psychologists. Yet this happened,” Naik said."

“Entire records of the jail have been gutted in the fire caused by undertrials and this has complicated matters. Several convicts, who were to go on parole or were about to complete the sentence, could suffer because of this. The convicts were angry over the rampage by undertrials,” he said.

Even blankets, rations and medicines inside the jail were completely destroyed and he had asked the state government to helping out the jail authorities, the DGP said.

While he has already written to the state government for taking steps to improve the system inside the jails, the focus now was more on security, he added. Meanwhile, it is learnt that some undertrials were also being shifted out to other jails."

PANAJI: The directorate of fire and emergency services has to rely on the police department for investigations into suspected cases of arson, as it does not have an investigation wing of its own.Admitting this, director Ashok Menon said no fire and emergency services across the country has an investigation wing.Sources say this lacuna bodes well for the perpetrators as the already-burdened police often take a long time to complete investigations. The report confirming foul play is therefore often a long time coming.""When we ask they (police) merely say that the investigation is on,"" said a fire services official, wishing not to be named.On February 20, one of Panaji's oldest buildings, a one-storey structure near the old Patto bridge , was engulfed in flames, that a day later appeared to have been deliberately set. The investigation into it is, of course, still on.""We can normally tell a fire has been deliberately set because it will arise from more than one spot. Then there would also be the strong smell of petrol or some other chemical,"" said fire services officials.Asked if the directorate follows up on establishments having firefighting measures in place, Menon said that proprietors rarely renew the one-year-valid NOC.""This violation is not a punishable offence so most don't come back for renewals,"" said Menon.Sources stressed that the onus of responsibility to get the renewal lies solely with the proprietors of establishments."

RAIPUR: Even as the under construction JK Lakshmi Cement plant project at Malpuri-Khurd village , in Durg district, witnessed a massive loss in the last two months, and post arson damages done by local villagers, the plant will go ahead with its plans, said plant authorities on Tuesday.However, as per investigations and internal sources, it is a clear case of negligence by the police who lingered on the complaints lodged by the cement major and failed to take any steps to prevent the untoward incident. Even after the agitation took a bad shape following the death of a labourer on April 1, cops showed no sign of action to control the situation, sources alleged.""The locals were instigated by few trade unions and individuals for demanding permanent and on-roles job for the family as well as kin. J K Lakshmi, in fact, hired 500 people from 100 existing families in Malpuri, including their cousins. Moreover, about 2,200 workers, labourers and skilled-labourers were also provided employment from nearby areas including Koriya, Ahirwara and others, but they insisted on permanent jobs. Though we never denied it, we would hire maximum people and train them for ITI also once the plant begins functioning. This was decided in a meeting held in December in presence of tehsildar, superintendent of police, panchayats and labourers after the locals protested last year,"" DK Mehta, senior vice president (works) told TOI.Plant authorities dismissed the locals' allegation of their land being seized based on the promise of jobs. They also denied that the reason behind the agitation was the death of a 19-year-old labourer. Mehta said that an approximate 415 acres of land area was bought from three prominent farmers namely Narayan Singh, Anand Singh and Padam Singh on Oct 1, 2010. ""There's no question of land acquisition from other locals,"" Mehta said.He said that police was informed on the first day, when locals had seized the southern portion of 80 acres in the plant area used for equipment storage and steel fabrication yard on February 14 and had stopped working since then. ""The protestors gheraoed that particular area and camped there. They destroyed the glasses of offices, yards and had taken away a lot of equipment, copper and silver wires with them. They had locked the gate from outside and barricaded the roads from both ends using pipe structures. As the villagers had deployed their families including women and children on the site, police resisted taking actions against them,"" Mehta added.Talking to TOI, Anand Chabra, superintendent of police said that the police were constantly in discussion with the district administration in order to resolve the matter and break the deadlock but with the death of the 19-year-old labourer on April 1, matters became worse. ""Nearly 47 locals are under arrest and investigations are underway,"" Chabra said.In another development, suspecting Naxalite links, police also have invoked Chhattisgarh Special Public Security Act (CSPSA) against Virendra Kurrey, whom cement plant authorities claimed to be leading the mob which gutted the factory. Police claims to have recovered Naxalism related literature during search at Virendra's house at Jamul town.Following a protest since February 14, more than 150 locals had set a portion of the cement plant on fire, reportedly infuriated over company's reluctance to give jobs. TOI visited the plant site in Durg and witnessed a number of burnt vehicles, yards and offices, which reflected that the attack was done in a planned manner as mostly those parts of the plant were gutted which resulted in massive loss to the company. Earth moving equipment, concrete mixers, tractors, lifts, cranes, bull-dozers, including a police van were among those gutted at the plant which aims to set up 2.7MT capacity greenfield plant with an investment of over Rs 1,500 crore.""We were trying to convince the protestors through dialogue as J K Organisation did not want any use of force or antagonize the local villagers, but we probably failed to gauge the extent they can go to,"" said Chouksey."

LUCKNOW: Tension prevailed in curfew-hit Moradabad district of Uttar Pradesh after violent clashes and arson following a dispute between members of two communities late on Tuesday night. A police outpost was torched along with three shops, over a dozen kiosks and a couple of two-wheelers in the incident which left at least 11 persons injured.The Tuesday night violence was a sequel to altercation between members of the two communities in Das Sarai police circle on Sunday night. The trouble began when pilgrims of one community were passing through the main road raising slogans which is a common practice.However, when these pilgrims reached a stretch of the road which was partly occupied by members of another community who were offering prayers in a group, the two sides entered into a dispute over the sloganeering.The issue was however resolved due to prompt action of the local police and that of the senior citizens from the two communities. Thereafter, district authorities assigned a separate route for the pilgrims passing through the area to avoid further confrontation. On Tuesday night, a different set of pilgrims — in the absence of any police force to inform them about the changed route — took the old route and entered into confrontation with the members of the other community who were offering prayers by the roadside, a practice that is slated to continue for the next fortnight.Police’s failure to react in time left the clashing sides unattended and soon the situation slipped out of control. Things took a turn for the worse when the information about the clashes spread to other parts of the city leading to more arson and heavy brick-batting between the members of the two communities. It was however the initiative of the senior citizens from the two sides that helped cops restrict the violence from spreading over the region.Authorities, on Wednesday, described the situation as under control with no fresh incidents of violence. They, however, said that curfew would remain in force in six police circles of the district till further notice. Director general of police (special) Brij Lal, who is camping in Moradabad, said that 50 persons had been arrested in connection with the violence and 10 companies of PAC and three companies of Rapid Action Force (RAF) called in from outside to maintain peace in the trouble-hit pockets of the district.According to the government reports, as many as 11 persons were injured in the clashes, one of whom — who had suffered severe head injuries — was referred to Delhi after his condition deteriorated. At least six policemen, including two officers, were also injured while trying to control the mob."

LUCKNOW: Taking a strong exception to the reports of senior ministers visiting jail to meet the accused of the arson case, UPCC president Rita Bahuguna Joshi alleged that arrest of the two BSP leaders Jitender Singh Babloo and Intezaar Ahmad Abdi seemed to be a part of a conspiracy hatched by the Mayawati government.""The royal treatment meted out to the duo amply proves that they are being sheltered and patronised by the current regime and therefore points to the involvement of chief minister Mayawati in the incident,"" a statement released by Joshi claimed on Saturday .Joshi slammed, ""the unending queue of BSP leaders including senior cabinet ministers Naseemuddin Siddiqui and Babu Singh Kushwaha to the prison to meet the jailed duo, which began early morning and continued till late in the night. Both of them are being provided with all the comforts and luxury, which shows that the arrest was done was under pressure and not due to desire to provide justice."" Since all this makes it quite evident that the arson was okayed by chief minister Mayawati and her officials, there is no hope of justice unless the case is handed over to the CBI, she added .The UPCC chief also charged the BSP ministers with violation of UP Jail Manual. Her statement specifically mentioned how she was ""routinely denied permission to meet in jail the political prisoner arrested in anti-government stir. Everytime, whether it was a request to meet Neelu -the Banda rape victim or arrested Gram Rozkar Sevaks, authorities have quoted jail manual to turn down her requests.""""I would like to know then how could the authorities permit entry of the red and blue beacon cars and their occupants to the jail premise and meet the accused in an arson case? How could late night visits were allowed,"" she asked and added that both the senior BSP ministers, during the meeting clearly showed that the ""intention was to assure the two accused or to convey some important message.""Joshi demanded an explanation from the government into the said illegal and irregular jail visit and stated that the leaders violating jail manual ought to be dealt sternly."

GAYA: Even as the striking junior doctors resumed duty following the end of their five-day strike, uncertainty grips Anugrah Narain Magadh Medical College and Hospital ( ANMMCH ), Gaya, in view of arrest threat looming large over medicos named in the FIR for alleged involvement in offences like violence arson and vandalism Activity remained less than normal in the hospital, the scene of violence, protest, siege and arson during the last few days.ANMMCH superintendent Dr Sita Ram claimed that normalcy had been restored in the hospital. Asked whether the medicos, figuring as accused in the FIR registered with the local police station, have joined duty, the superintendent said that he has not gone through the attendance records of the junior doctors.Asked whether any department proceedings will be conducted against the doctors facing criminal charges, the superintendent said that a decision in the matter will be taken at the meeting scheduled for Monday.With RJD MLA Surendra Prasad Yadav in jail, all eyes are now fixed on police action against those charged with serious criminal offences like torching of the police jeep and causing head injury to a policeman deputed as the bodyguard of the Gaya Sadar SDO.On his part, SSP Amit Lodha made it clear that those responsible for the torching of the police jeep and other serious criminal offences will be brought to justice. Though police officials do not admit it in public, the threat of a fresh round of strike by the medicos in case those figuring as named accused in the FIR are arrested, is holding back the policemen from taking the same tough posture against the medicos that it did against Surendra Yadav.Reacting to the developments, senior RJD leader and former minister Shakeel Ahmad Khan said that the government apparently succumbed to what he called the blackmailing tactics of the striking doctors."

MUMBAI: Does the Rs 25 lakh seized during an investigation into an arson case about 15 years ago exist or has it been eaten away by rats in a police godown? The question was raised by the Bombay High Court on Friday while it heard an appeal against acquittal .A division bench of Justice B H Marlapalle and Justice U D Salvi has now asked the government to find out whether the cash dumped in a godown used by police to store ‘muddemal property’ (seized property related to crime or recovered from the scene of offence) still exists or has it been damaged or destroyed. The court has directed the prosecution to produce the cash on January 21 when matter will be heard next.The directives were given while hearing an application filed by one Chandrakant Hande seeking return of his cash which was recovered by the police in 1995.""Since 1995, the cash is just lying in a godown. Does it still exist or has it been eaten away by rodents? Bring the bag (containing cash) to us. We want to see it personally,"" remarked Justice Marlapalle Hande’s application stated that his house had burnt in 1995 and his daughter Sangeeta had suffered burnt injuries while trying to extinguish the fire. In the meantime, the investigation revealed that Sangeeta had burnt the house along with her friend Kirti Shah and Kirti’s father Jeevraj . The prosecution alleged that the motive behind the crime was money.The prosecution clamined that at Sangeeta’s behest, some cash was recovered from ahostel in Bijapur where Kirit was staying and from her relative’s house in Belgaum. Also, some cash was present in the house which was burnt down.After alleging that the cash was the motive behind the incident , police seized Rs 25 lakh. It was produced as muddemal before the trial court.The trial court acquitted all the three accused in 2003. The trial court also directed that the muddemal property, including the cash, be returned to Hande. The trial court ruled that Hande was entitled to Rs 16 lakh only as some money was seized from Jeevraaj Shah’s house, so Hande did not have claim on that.The government approached the high court challenging their acquittal. Hande too filed application in 2005 seeking return of the entire Rs 25 lakh.Hande’s advocate Ganesh Gole said his client was entitled to the entire amount and not just Rs 16 lakh as concluded by the sessions court. ""If the appeal is allowed and the accused are convicted, then their claim over the money does not survive,"" argued Gole.Shah’s counsel Niteen Pradhan argued that part of the money lying in a police godown belongs to Shah and therefore Hande cannot withdraw the entire amount. ""We have no objection to him (Hande) withdrawing the Rs 16 lakh, as allowed by the sessions court,"" Pradhan told the court."

COIMBATORE: A five-member fact finding mission led by A Marx , state president, Peoples Union for Human Rights (PUHR), visited Angammal Colony near Salem on Thursday to investigate allegations that supporters of senior DMK leader and former minister Veerapandi Arumugam had assaulted its residents and set a few huts on fire. Arumugam and 18 others were arrested and the former is in Vellore jail in connection with the incident that took place on June 3, birthday of DMK chief M Karunanidhi.The team, in Salem to trace the sequence of events and probe the extent of rights violations, spent a few hours in the colony talking to residents. “We met the victims in Angammal Colony and have recorded their statements. We have also discussed the matter with the Salem police commissioner and other legal representatives of the victims,’ Marx told TOI.""They (the miscreants) barged into our hut a few minutes after midnight and wreaked havoc and set it on fire. One of them caught my eight-year-old daughter and dragged her around. I was held at knife point and abuses showered on us,” Sakunthala Venkatesan, one of the occupants of the colony, told the team members. “All of them had their faces covered and were armed with cricket bat, stumps, sickles and bottles. They appeared drunk. They terrorised the people,” added G Gunaseelan, relative of K Venkatesan, whose hut was allegedly set on fire by the gang.The fact-finding team could meet only the complainants as they claimed the legal representatives and supporters of the accused minister refused to meet them. However, Veerapandi Arumugam’s legal counsel, R Srinivasan, said he had told the team members when they contacted him in the morning that he’ll be available in the evening. “But they didn’t turn up,” Srinivasan claimed. He also refuted the charges levelled against the former minister and his aides.The fact-finding team comprising K Sukumaran, secretary of Federation of People’s Rights from Pondicherry, A Anand, a documentary maker, Sankar and M Senthil besides Marx, also met Salem police commissioner K C Mahali and recorded his version about the incident. Later, Mahali told TOI that 19 people including Arumugam have been arrested in connection with the case under various sections of the Indian Penal Code. His close relatives and legal aid are also booked in the case. “We have also initiated action against police personnel from the nearby Pallapatti police station since they failed to respond quickly and prevent the incident. Inspector of the station, V Anandhan, has been transferred and a sub inspector, s sub inspector and a constable have been placed under suspension,” Mahali added.Angammal Colony case, which has acquired a political hue after the arrest of Arumugam, has been simmering since 23 families, who were allegedly evicted from 20,000 square feet of land in the colony at the behest of Arumugam in 2008, returned after DMK lost office last year and a slew of cases including land grab were slapped on the party strongman."

An FIR was registered against moderate separatist leader Mirwaiz Umer Farooq for inciting violence , officials said.A senior police official said imposition of curfew had become necessary in the wake of the massive violence that followed a separatist march in Srinagar on Saturday that was led by the Mirwaiz, chairman of the moderate Hurriyat group, and Muhammad Yasin Malik, chairman of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front.A first information report (FIR) has been lodged against the Mirwaiz for inciting people to violence, the officer said.Asked whether the Mirwaiz would be arrested, he said: ""The law will take it own course.""Indefinite curfew was also imposed in north Kashmir Baramulla and Sopore towns and south Kashmir Anantnag and Pulwama towns.Srinagar saw unprecedented violence Saturday after mass Eid prayers as hundreds of youth shouted pro-freedom slogans and attacked police and government buildings.As the prayers ended at the famed Sufi shrine of Hazratbal Saturday morning, thousands egged on by the Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Yasin Malik marched to the city centre Lal Chowk, indulging in arson attacks.While the police and paramilitary personnel refrained from firing at the mobs so as not to kill civilians, the crowds went on an arson spree, starting right from the Hazratbal shrine where police barracks within the complex were set on fire.Later, smaller groups torched the building of the state electricity department and offices of the Crime Branch of the Jammu and Kashmir Police."
304,Arson,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/nri/us-canada-news/PIO-woman-who-set-hubby-on-fire-gets-20-years-jail-for-arson/articleshow/31912931.cms,"WASHINGTON: This much almost all parties seemed to agree on. Shriya Patel took a taxi on a spring morning in 2012, stopped at a gas station to fill a canister with petrol, and picked up candle-sticks, masking tape, and other supplies at a WalMart . Then she returned home, detached the smoke alarms, covered up the water sprinklers, and dousing her husband Bimal Patel with petrol as he lolled in the bathtub, set the place on fire.After fighting for his life, he died several weeks later despite high-end care.According to the prosecution, Shriya, who had been in the US for just a week at that point, having joined her Indian-American husband a year after an arranged marriage in India, cold-bloodedly planned his murder. She had married him reluctantly, only to make jealous another man in Mumbai to whom she gave up her virginity, Chelsea Schwierking, an American witness testified in court. Schwierking and her husband, who was Bimal’s schoolmate at Texas Tech, had attended the marriage in India, and she had heard this from Shriya herself during the wedding.Shriya was also said to be disappointed with her husband’s station in life; she had expected to arrive at a wealthy PIO husband ’s home. Instead, she came to a young man struggling to make ends meet in a dead end job, even through his motel-owning family was relatively wealthy. So, according to the defense, the Amarillo, Texas-born Indian-American persuaded her to help him commit suicide, and as a “dutiful” Indian wife, she obliged. He had written depressed text messages to friends in the days before his death, including “I feel like I am going to snap” and “I feel weighted down like a branch on a tree being pulled down”.Several intriguing bits of testimony was produced from both sides, none of which fully accounted for the bizarre episode that resulted in the death of a 29-year old in the prime of life, who from accounts of prosecution witnesses, was a happy-go-lucky guy who worked enthusiastically to bring his wife to the US. He even drew up a list of things he needed to do for her (“Buy Shriya cellphone” read one task). He was not the kind to kill himself, and even if he did, he did not need his wife’s help, much less implicate her. Police reports also showed that he had tried to beat down the bathroom door which had been locked from outside after Shriya started the fire. “Why would she do this to me?” first witnesses quoted Bimal Patel as saying.But the defense punched many holes in the murder theory. Shriya had been in the country for only a week and hardly knew her way around. Contrary to the prosecution’s efforts to show her has as a London-educated sophisticate, she was actually from a working class Gujarati family whose father had been a factory worker in Dubai. The taxi-driver who picked her up on the morning of the incident said she asked him to take her to a police station more than once before changing her mind. And most bafflingly, autopsy reports showed that Bimal Patel’s nose had been stuffed with cotton balls; they were singed, so they had been inserted before he died in the fire.After nearly ten hours of deliberation, a Texas jury on Tuesday sentenced Shriya to 20 years in prison for first-degree arson that led to Bimal Patel’s death, rejecting the prosecution case for capital murder. She has already been in prison for two years and will be eligible for parole in three more, upon which she may be deported to India."

MELBOURNE: An explosion triggered by a suspected arson attack ripped apart an Indian restaurant in Sydney , prompting police to investigate the possible links of the incident to a bomb threat.The Indian restaurant in Sydney was last night engulfed by fire, which police suspect was ‘deliberately lit’ and four people escaped unhurt in the incident.Police is investigating the possibility of links to a bomb threat at the the Copper Tiffin restaurant on Cleveland Street some time back, Sydney Morning Herald reported.An unnamed nearby restaurant owner said he had heard a “loud explosion, like bomb” just after 11:30pm.The explosion threw out debris and caused glass and signs to cover the road.“Then I saw people climbing out of a window, about four, (it was) very lucky,” he said.Two people were seen running away from the site just after 11.30pm as fire engulfed the building, witnesses told police. Shortly thereafter, an explosion was heard and a witness said the front of the shop was missing.Police reportedly said the blaze was ‘deliberately lit’ and that they were hunting for two men who were seen running away from the scene.The explosion damaged property but four people at a residential property above the restaurant escaped, with only one needing hospital treatment for smoke inhalation.A spokesman for NSW Fire Brigades said around 20 firies managed to bring the blaze under control just after midnight and it was prevented from spreading to neighbouring properties."

MARGAO: The fire at Sonsoddo garbage dump, that began late on Saturday night was burning again on Tuesday evening and fire service officials said putting it out could take the entire night.Described as the biggest in recent years, the fire continues to rage even as the fire tenders once again started spraying pressured water at the site on Tuesday evening. Efforts were continuing till late Tuesday night.The fire that had been brought under control on Sunday, was seen smouldering again on Monday and was doused after some 2.40 lakh litres of water were sprayed over it. It, however, restarted on Tuesday morning with a thick blanket of smoke emanating from the dump.Meanwhile, with a consensus emerging that the fire could have been deliberately ignited, Margao town police have filed a case of mischief by fire against unknown persons. ""This fire just could not have started on its own,"" said MMC chairperson Savio Coutinho.While Margao municipal council (MMC) filed a complaint in this regard, Margao town police inspector, Rajendra Prabhu Dessai said the police have sought reports from the fire services department and the Goa state pollution control board on their opinion on the fire.Assistant divisional officer (Margao fire services division), Prakash Parab affirmed that locals had reported seeing some people with coconut husks on Monday night moving around the garbage site.While municipal administration director Daulat Hawaldar acknowledged that the fire incident appeared to be an act of sabotage, the technical team of the GSPCB admitted that the situation was indeed ""grave"" and posed ""severe"" health hazards.The GSPCB is expected to install samplers at some affected spots on Wednesday to determine the pollution levels in the area. ""We will monitor the pollution levels for 24 hours and then submit our report. The amount of particulate matter in the air and level of sulphur dioxide will be determined during the monitoring process,"" executive environmental engineer Rajendra Kamat told the media, adding that suggestions regarding remedial measures will be detailed in the report that is expected to be ready by Friday.Meanwhile, the callous attitude of the authorities towards the potentially disastrous situation was clearly evident as the GSPCB failed to register its presence at the site till Tuesday evening. The chairman of the GSPCB, L U Joshi, when contacted, refrained from making any statement on the issue.Urban development minister Joaquim Alemao who visited the site on Tuesday evening was accompanied by Hawaldar and a technical team of the GSPCB, Coutinho and chief officer Y B Tavde.Alemao displayed his disapproval over the Goa Foundation's (GF) handling of the situation. The MMC has entered into an agreement with GF to undertake composting operations at the site.""Claude Alvares (director of GF) should have been here to offer suggestions over measures to control the fire. Hyquip (the party earlier handling the site) had worked quite efficiently and I can vouch for that. It was the delay on the part of our government to effect their payments in time that the problems arose for Hyquip,"" Alemao said and directed the MMC chairperson to take precautions to ensure such situations do not recur.""No money will be paid to the MMC for the first phase of the project (estimated to cost over Rs 55 lakh) until the proposal is cleared by me,"" Alemao declared, and questioned the wisdom of the MMC in signing an MoU with GF to that effect without getting the proposal cleared.Alvares, also feared that there could be some human forces behind the fire. He pointed out that, had there been a fire beneath the garbage mounds, there would have been smoke at the site that he or other workers would have noticed, as the plastics would have burned and smoke billowed from inside. But nothing of that sort had been noticed.Fatorda MLA Damu Naik, present at the site at time of Alemao's visit, lambasted the state administration for its failure in bringing the situation under control. ""It's a failure of the state administration. The district collector is monitoring the disaster management activities from the control room while the residents are made to inhale the toxic fumes for days together,"" he remarked.A resident of Gogol, Rosario Dantas, claiming to have considerable experience in handling garbage treatment plants overseas, offered to bring the situation under control, provided necessary earthmoving machines and manpower were made available to him at the site. The offer was promptly accepted by Alemao and Coutinho, who agreed to procure the necessary machinery and provide the required support.Rajya Sabha MP Shantaram Naik, who visited the site on Tuesday said he wouldn't like to comment on whether the fire was due to natural consequences or there was some motive behind it. He, however, added, ""the only thing I know is that the person who told me about the incident said there was a fire at two different places."" A fire simultaneously at two places appeared to be rather unusual to Naik.Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco, MLA from Curtorim, the constituency that abuts the site, alleged that there could be a possibility of a human hand behind the fire. ""Maybe,"" was his cryptic comment, when asked what he thought about the fire.Coutinho said that a fire at the dumpsite was not an unusual feature, but that it would occur before the monsoons and the rains would douse the fire. But this time the fire started several months prior to monsoon and has not been contained so far. The concern is huge, he pointed out."

LUCKNOW: Even as the Lucknow police chief deputy inspector general (DIG) Rajeev Krishna announced slapping of National Security Act (NSA) on those involved in arson, incharge of the Dar-ul-Shafa police outpost in Hazratganj was suspended and his circle officer (CO) asked to explain the reasons which led to their failure in stopping a government bus being torched right outside the Vidhan Bhawan in Lucknow.The bus was torched reportedly by the Samajwadi Party (SP) activists to mark Tuesday's nationwide bandh called by a cluster of 13 political banners from the opposition benches in the parliament, to protest against price hike because of the faulty policies of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) ruling at the Centre.In Lucknow, three buses were torched in separate incidents including one outside the Vidhan Bhawan which is deemed as the nucleus of the highest security cordon in the state capital. Taking it as a result of gross negligence and casual approach towards security of the area, the local police outpost incharge sub-inspector (S-I) Balram Misra was put under suspension with immediate effect while an explanation was sought from his circle officer (CO) Hazratganj, deputy superintendent of police (DySP) Piyush Ranjan for the incident.Though the bandh was called by a group of 13 political parties, it remained an out-and-out Samajwadi Party (SP) affair across Uttar Pradesh. In Lucknow, state SP president Akhilesh Singh Yadav courted arrest along with some 600 supporters while some 1,600 SP activists were rounded up in the rest of the state."

LUCKNOW: A local court on Wednesday ordered lodging of an FIR against two Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leaders, including a sitting MLA, three police officers and half-a-dozen of their unidentified associates in connection with the arson on the house of state Congress president Rita Bahuguna Joshi . The court orders came on an application of Rajbir Singh, member of UP Congress Working Committee (UPCWC) whose car was torched in the incident in a conspiracy to murder him as the accused believed that he was in the vehicle at that time.The FIR, when lodged, will be the first police document to have names of the BSP leaders and police officers as accused in connection with the arson. In the earlier FIR, the complainant was the police itself and none of the above had figured as accused.Rajbir had moved a complaint before the Lucknow chief judicial magistrate stating that his Ambassador car was parked at the 24, Sarojni Naidu Marg residence of UP Congress president Rita Bahuguna Joshi on July 15, 2009, when some miscreants, accompanied by senior police officers, stormed the premises and torched everything in sight. Though the police had registered a case in connection with the arson, the investigations did not take cognizance of the fact that his car was also torched with the intention of killing him, his application stated."

BANGALORE: A fire that broke out at an evaluation centre of Bangalore University at Jnanabharathi campus has raised eyebrows among University authorities. The section where the fire broke out on Monday evening, was used to keep old answer scripts.Studying the nature of the incident, officials feel it's ""mischievous and intentional"". Registrar (evaluation) M S Talwar said there was no way a short circuit could have happened.""The fire was noticed at 6.30 pm in the evaluation centre, where only old answer scripts were kept. No new valued answer scripts were kept in this centre. We are still figuring out how the fire broke out,"" he said, even as he describes the intensity of fire ""as a thick cloud of smoke"".Registrar M G Krishnan said, ""The centre was not used by anyone and only old valued answer scripts were kept there. It's definitely intentional. The fire has taken place both in the first and second floor and they are two different fire incidents. It is not like one floor caught fire and then spread to another,"" he said.Meanwhile, three fire tenders were rushed to the spot, and took one-and-half hours to extinguish the flames. ""It is too premature to say the reason. Our first aim was to extinguish the fire and it will take a day to come to any conclusion,"" said Fire Force director B G Chengappa.On delay by fire tenders reaching the place, Chengappa said there are no fire stations around Nagarbhavi. ""We had to rush fire tenders from Mysore Road, Banashankari and Rajajinagar. We got one sanctioned for Nagarabhavi area, but are looking for a place. We have requested for one acre of land from University authorities, so we can take up construction immediately,"" he added."

LUCKNOW: In UP Congress chief, Rita Bahuguna Joshi's house arson case , chief minister Mayawati on Monday apprised the high court that the law has taken its own course, without any outside influence. The CB-CID is conducting fair and impartial investigation without any pressure from her as well as the state government.Filing counter-affidavit in response to the court's earlier order on the petition of Joshi, seeking CBI probe into the incident, Joshi had pleaded that the arson took place in presence of top police and administrative officials of the state government. The real culprit were being shielded, rather rewarded with plum posts in the government. In this view, Joshi stressed, that CB-CID being a state agency could not make fair investigations, hence the investigation should be transferred to CBI.Mayawati contended in her personal affidavit that she was not exerting any pressure on probe agency. The allegations in the petition against her are insulting and humiliating. She stated that the allegations have been levelled due to political vendetta.Joshi filed a rejoinder affidavit against the counter-affidavit of the government. The bench of Justice Abdul Mateen and Justice Dr Satish Chandra took Mayawati's counter-affidavit and Joshi's rejoinder affidavit on record and posted the matter in next month for further hearing."

Kolkata: Police submitted a chargesheet on Wednesday against the 14 accused in the Vedic Village arson case , including Rajkishore Modi, the managing director of Vedic Reality and prime accused Gaffar Mollah.Gaffar and his associates had opened fire indiscriminately on villagers at Sikharpur village in Rajarhat on the afternoon of August 23. Amirul Islam, a local youth, died in the firing and a few others sustained serious bullet injuries. Soon after the firing, villagers had turned violent and set the resort on fire. Two separate cases of murder and arson were registered with Rajarhat police.Police, however, failed to trace another key accused, Azizul Islam alias Khude, brother of Trinamool Congress MLA Arabul Islam, and three other accused. Showing all these four as absconding, the investigators have charged all 14 accused for murder, conspiracy, attempt to murder and possessing illegal arms and ammunition.The incident had unearthed how Gaffar forcefully grabbed farmland from the villagers for Vedic Reality. The investigation also confirmed that Modi had direct connection with Gaffar and his associates, who used Vedic Village as their shelter and a safe store of arms.Police confirmed in their final report that Modi was aware of the activities of Gaffar and provided help for them. All have been chargesheeted within 50 days at Barasat court and none of the 10 arrested accused have been granted bail during investigation."

NEW DELHI: Congress has alleged that the BSP supremo and UP chief minister Mayawati is responsible for the attack at UPCC chief Rita Bahuguna Joshi's house on July 15. ( Watch Unhappy over Uttar Pradesh government ordering a CB-CID probe, senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh on Saturday demanded a CBI inquiry into the recent attack and arsoning at the residence of UPCC chief Rita Bahuguna Joshi.Only a CBI probe will unravel the truth behind the incident, the Congress General Secretary and in-charge of UP affairs said.He was talking to reporters after visiting Joshi's residence here.The Congress leader alleged that the loot, attack and arsoning at Joshi's residence was committed ""at the behest"" of chief minister Mayawati.The incident appeared to be a ""pre-planned affair"" and nothing short of a CBI probe would be able to workout the case, he added.The Allahabad High Court had on Friday reserved its judgement on a writ petition filed by Joshi seeking a CBI inquiry into the attack on her Lucknow residence and quashing of the FIR filed against her in Moradabad.The judgement was reserved by a Division Bench comprising Justice Ravindra Singh and Justice Naheed Ara Moonis after hearing arguments from both sides.While Joshi was represented in the court by her lawyer Umesh Narain Sharma, who is also the chairman of UPCC Legal Cell, Uttar Pradesh Advocate General Jyotindra Mishra and government advocate D R Chaudhary appeared on behalf of the state government.Joshi's alleged derogatory statements against Mayawati in Moradabad on July 15 triggered a political storm. She was arrested under the SC/ST Act, besides other sections of the IPC.Joshi's house in Lucknow, a stone's throw away from the Raj Bhavan, was torched by a mob late in the night on July 15.Congress leaders alleged that ruling BSP workers were behind the arson though Mayawati claimed that it was ""a drama enacted at the behest of the Congress high command"".The state government has ordered a CB-CID inquiry into the incident even as Joshi said that she will not accept a probe by any agency over which the Mayawati government exercised control."

LUCKNOW: MM Intezar Abdi alias Bobby, one of the accused in arson at UP Congress Chief Rita Bahugana Joshi's house on July 15, has been rewarded with the status of minister of state by chief minister Mayawati. A former student union president of Shia PG College, Abdi has been appointed chairman of the UP Ganna Kisan Sansthan for his `outstanding' services rendered to the BSP.Significantly, the state government on Monday evening issued a clarification that the decision to appoint Abdi as chairperson of the Ganna Kisan Sansthan had been taken on July 14 and he took charge in the morning of July 15. The arson at Joshi's house took place in the night of July 15, hence the question of government rewarding Abdi does not arise. Further, the government press release said that Abdi has not been named in the FIR lodged in connection with the arson.The government clarification came after a media reports that Abdi has been rewarded for the arson at Joshi's house. Abdi also told reporters that he took charge on July 15 itself and no way he was involved in the arson. The main task of the Ganna Kisan Sansthan is to educate farmers about new cultivation techniques, how to protect their crop and get best possible prices. The chairman of the sansthan gets the status equivalent to minister of state.However, contrary to the claims made by Abdi and the state government, the sequence of events narrate a different story. Abdi is a former students union president of Shia PG College. He visited the campus a couple of days back but did not mention about his `chairmanship' to anybody there. It was only on the Sunday evening (July 19) when the news spread, Abdi's supporters took out a procession in various localities of the Old City and distributed sweets among people.When mediapersons reached Ganna Kisan Sansthan on Monday morning (July 20), they found that chairman's personal staff was unaware of the development. They said that neither they have received any information about Abdi, nor they have seen him so far. But later after `inquiring' with a senior officer in the administration, the staff `clarified' that Abdi is the new chairman. Abdi was expected to `attend' the office on Monday but didn' show up till the evening.In fact, Abdi was not available for comments all day on Monday. His mobile phone was switched off. However, on Sunday, he had told reporters that he has been awarded for his ten years services to the party. Besides serving BSP as a district president in 2000, he had contested 2002 assembly elections on BSP ticket from Lucknow West seat but got only 8,525 votes. At present, he is also supervising BSP's preparation for Lucknow West bye-election to be held soon.Though the Congress has named Abdi and BSP Bikapur MLA Jitendra Singh in its complaint as the two BSP leaders who led the mob which set Joshi's house on fire, police have not included the former's name in the FIR so far. Teachers and the old timers in Shia PG College recalled how as a student leader from 1992-1995 Abdi's name figured in several cases related to extortion, murder, land grabbing, teacher-bashing, instigating violence on the campus among other things.""Abdi did his BSc in mathematics and LLB from the college. His main business as student leader was extortion. After graduating, he also registered himself as an advocate in the Bar but never pursued the profession seriously. At present, he has a franchisee of a mobile phone company, deals in government contracts and has got right contacts in the political corridors,"" a former student union leader and an old associate of Abdi told TOI pleading anonymity."

LUCKNOW: After promising to punish those behind the arson attack on UPCC chief Rita Bah-uguna Joshi���s house on July 15, the Uttar Pradesh government appointed Intezar Abdi, named by Congress as one of the two BSP leaders who led the mob into Joshi���s house, as the chairman of a corporation which has the status of a minister of state. Abdi will head UP Ganna Sansthan for his ������outstanding services������ to BSP.The state government announced that the order to appoint Abdi was issued on July 14 and must not be seen as any kind of ������reward������. Apparently, while Congress filed a complaint against Abdi and BSP MLA from Bikapur Jitendra Singh, Abdi���s name does not figure in the FIR lodged with the police. Denying any role in the arson, Abdi said his appointment was made before July 15. But nobody in the sansthan was aware of his appointment until Monday morning. When asked, the employees first said Vinay Shakya is the chairman but, after clarifying with senior officers, said Abdi is the new incumbent.Interestingly, the personal staff of Ganna Sansthan chairman was told by officers in the state administration that Abdi might attend office on Monday, but he didn���t arrive until the evening, triggering speculation over ���status��� of new chairman.At Shia PG College, where Abdi was once a student leader, the staff said Abdi made no mention of his appointment during a visit a couple of days back. ������He told us Congress has named him as an accused in arson case and he might be arrested. But he didn���t tell us he has been granted status of a minister of state,������ said a senior teacher.Besides serving BSP district president in 2000, Abdi had contested 2002 polls from Lucknow West but lost miserably. He is currently supervising party���s preparation for Lucknow West by-election.Talking to journalists earlier, Abdi had said he has a clean track record and had no reason to indulge in arson at Joshi���s house. Old timers at Shia PG College recalled that Abdi���s name figured in several cases relating to extortion, murder, instigating violence on campus between 1992-95.������Abdi did his BSc in mathematics and LLB from the college. He was a student leader and an extortionist. After graduating, he also registered himself as an advocate but never pursued the profession. He is now a franchisee of a mobile phone company and deals in government contracts,������ said a former student union leader."

LUCKNOW: Even as Congressmen here get ready to accord a grand welcome to Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) president Rita Bahuguna Joshi, slated to reach the city on Monday morning, the UP government on Sunday issued orders for the transfer of investigation into the July 16 incident at her house to the state CB-CID.The Congress has been demanding a CBI probe into the violence on grounds that the incident involved Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) workers as well as the district police. According to the Congress, only a central agency would be able to work out the case."

LUCKNOW: When Guddu Yadav, Shiv Kumar and Inder Singh entered into a brawl and were brought to the Cantonment police station on Wednesday night, they had hardly any inkling that their encounter with the police will mark the start of their `criminal career'. The situation was no different for Susajit and Zameer Khan who were rounded up for a street brawl. On Thursday, all the five landed in the Lucknow district jail as accused in arson incident that took place at the house of Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) president Rita Bahuguna Joshi late on Wednesday night.""We were present at the Cantonment police station when the cops took them away for a medical examination around 11 pm. When they failed to return till well past midnight, we got concerned but no one told us anything till around 11 am the next morning,"" said Pushpa, wife of Shiv Kumar, while talking to TOI. A resident of Mohanlalganj and a tempo driver by profession, Shiv Kumar had come to visit his brother-in-law Guddu Yadav at the latter's Neelmatha residence on Wednesday evening when Guddu picked up a quarrel with his next-door neighbour Inder Singh.""The dispute was about the drain water that passes from the front portion of the house. Guddu had asked Inder to get the drain repaired as it was situated in front of his house, but the latter was unwilling,"" recollected Sanjay, a neighbour of Guddu Yadav. A heated argument that ensued between them turned into a fist fight as Guddu was joined by Shiv Kumar. While the exchange of blows was underway, cops from the Cantonment police station reached the site and took them to the police station, Sanjay told TOI.""We followed them to the police station and stood there at the gates till the cops took them away in a jeep saying that they will return after medical examination. But they didn't. It was well in the morning that we came to know that the three had been sent to jail for arson,"" Pushpa said.Zameer and Susajit's case is all the more surprising. Working as an agent with an automobile company in Hazratganj, Zameer left his house in Nai Basti area around 9 pm on Wednesday telling his mother that he was going to Dehradun for company's work. He was waiting at the tempo stand in Hazratganj when he met a friend and both started to chat. Just then a youth passing from the scene bumped into Zameer. A heated argument that took place, turned violent. Police arrived at the scene took the two away, said Zameer's cousin Laiq.""The irony is that Zameer's engagement has been fixed for Saturday. With the kind of IPC sections that the cops have slapped on them, there is hardly any scope for him to be out on bail by then,"" lamented Laiq.According to incharge of the Hussainganj police station, Inspector BR Saroj, all the five were arrested while indulging in arson at the house of the UPCC chief. ""They were caught red-handed and I myself nabbed them,"" he said, adding that he was the complainant of the case.Booked under sections 147 (Punishment for rioting), 504 (Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace), 506 (criminal intimidation), 427 (mischief causing damage to property) and 436 (mischief by fire explosive substance with intent to destroy house etc) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the five were sent to jail."

BEGUSARAI: Incidents of arson marred the day after angry traders took to the streets here on Tuesday to protest the killing of two traders, Chandan and Kundan (both brothers) on Monday.Police had a tough time in controlling the situation in the morning, as angry traders joined by workers of various political parties disrupted traffic near Har-Har Mahadeo Chowk on NH-31. Angry protesters placed the bodies of the victims on the road, demanding that CM Nitish Kumar come to the spot to deliver justice to the victims' families.Around midday senior administrative and police officials, including Munger DIG Amit Kumar, Begusarai DM Jeetendra Srivastava and SP P Kannan persuaded the protesters to lift the blockade. Ths DIG said police have already been reinforced with additional forces apart from two additional police outposts that would also be set up.Markets remained closed in the town after various trade organizations issued a bandh call over the issue.Car-borne criminals had shot dead Chandan (27) and Kundan (25) in front of their house while returning home after closing the family jewellery shop at Mugeriganj locality.Begusarai SP P Kannan said the killings are connected to a long-running dispute between the victims' family and one Rajendra Poddar over a one-and-a-half cottah plot of land. However, about three months ago, the Supreme Court passed a ruling in favour of the victims' family, helping mount the pressure on Rajendra to vacate the plot.Kannan said police had evidence of Rajendra's involvment in the crime as his pair of spectacles and slippers were found from the incident site.He said an FIR has been lodged against a dozen persons in this connection with the police arresting three of them so far.Meanwhile, tension again flared up early on Tuesday after a mob set Rajendra's house on fire. Rajendra used to reside with his family in a house on the disputed plot of land just opposite that of the victims. All his family members are absconding after the incident."

LONDON: Detectives of Scotland Yard have appealed for witnesses to come forward with information regarding a fire at a Hindu temple in Hillingdon on May 28.Officers were called by the London Fire Brigade following reports of a fire at 00:15hrs at the Adhya Shakti Mataji Temple along Cowley High Street.Fire fighters had managed to extinguish the fire which had caused significant damage to a temporary building positioned close to the temple.Scotland Yard who are calling it a serious case of arson said ""Officers are appealing to anyone who may have seen anything suspicious or anyone outside of the gates of the Temple or inside the Cowley Recreation Park next to the Temple, in the early hours of Tuesday to contact them"".Detective Richard Turner from Hillingdon Police said ""From our initial enquiries it would appear that the intended building in this arson was the Portakabin outside the Hindu Temple rather than the Temple itself. Nevertheless this is still an extremely serious incident which could have resulted in a fatality and we would urge anyone with any information about this crime to contact Hillingdon police's Community Safety Unit""."

MUMBAI: Chakur, the hometown of Union home minister Shivraj Patil, remained tense on Sunday, with the Congress and the Shiv Sena workers clashing over the Maharashtra-Karnataka border row in the last two days.

Sena workers had on Friday burnt an effigy of Patil at Latur, about 40 km from Chakur, reportedly protesting against the home ministry's ""biased"" stance on the border row.

This was followed by a violent reaction by the Congress men who on Saturday attacked the Sena's office and a restaurant owned by its district chief Subhash Kate in Chakur.

Police said when a Sena leader in Latur later announced that his party would ""give a fitting reply to the attack"", over 150 Congress workers from Latur rushed to Chakur and challenged the Sainiks to carry out the threat on Sunday, resulting in tension."

FARIDKOT: Angered over the death of a fellow inmate –-the fourth in a fortnight –-hundreds of prisoners at the Faridkot district jail went on a rampage for five hours on Monday as they clashed with the jail guards, damaged property and set the record room on fire.As many as six jail guards and dozens of inmates received injuries in the clash. Sources said Monday’s violence was triggered by the death of Harsha Singh, who was facing trial in a drugs recovery case, on Sunday late night.Sources said that the inmates alleged that the authorities did not take him to a hospital even though he kept writhing in pain the entire night. More than 300 inmates went on rampage on early Monday as the news of Harsha Singh’s death reached them.Sources said the prisoners also managed to smuggle LPG cylinders from the jail canteen to the courtyard and set some portions of the jail on fire and started damaging the jail tower, canteen and mess.A posse of policemen from neighbouring districts joined the guards to quell the violent prisoners. The cops had to open fire in air and use force to control the inmates.It was the fourth death of a prison inmate since April 8."

LUCKNOW: Reacting to the acquittal of Dr KK Singh and Dr RK Gupta in an incident of arson at the medical university, some faculty members are now pointing an accusing finger at the investigating agencies for messing up the case.

""If Dr Singh and Dr Gupta did not lead a group of medicos protesting the accidental death of Dr Deepak Agarwal and setting fire to the university's property then who were the perpetrators,"" the faculty members asked.

Eighteen months after the arson triggered by Dr Deepak’s death during the medical university’s (MU) centenary year celebrations on January 11, 2006, Dr Singh and Dr Gupta, the two main accused, were given a clean chit by a fast track court in Lucknow on Thursday. Dr Singh and Dr Gupta say that they were falsely implicated.

""The question as to who was responsible for the arson in which property worth lakhs and valuable documents were gutted remains unanswered,"" asked a senior administrative officer. TOI spoke to V-C Prof Hari Gautam, who said, ""I have no idea about the incident. It all happened much before I took charge. I am hearing from you about it for the first time.""

The students torched two four-wheelers and set afire offices in the administrative block, including the White Hall, ransacked the administrative office of erstwhile King George’s University of Dental Science (KGDUS) and vice-chancellor's residence. They even paralysed medical services.

The medical university turned into a military cauldron with PAC and RAF jawans all over.

Later, governor TV Rajeswar ordered a probe into the incident. The committee submitted its report after weeks of work and analysis.

It recommended reforms in the hospital and action against the wrong-doers. The investigation was done by the Lucknow Police on one hand and medical university authorities on another.

""If Dr KK Singh and Dr RK Gupta are not the wrong-doers, then who is the culprit. If investigating agencies fail to answer this question, its a shame on them,"" said a senior professor in the medical university’s medicine department.

While the then KGUDS V-C Prof CP Govila believed that things appeared to have been done in a well-planned manner, Prof Mahendra Bhandari, the then V-C of KGMU too believed in an insider theory.

Their belief stemmed from the fact that the mob was fully-prepared to ransack the administrative block. The rioters were carrying country-made pistols and cans containing petrol to set afire offices and vehicles.

Significantly, confidential records of purchase and examinations were gutted in the fire.

""An ordinary student cannot do such things. The students on their part too were shocked to see the rooms gutted in fire,"" recalled an assistant professor.

""The students were no doubt instigated. A handful of students, who had failed in the MBBS examinations cashed in on the sentiments after being provoked by an assistant professor supported by a couple of senior teachers, who wanted to settle scores with the then V-C Prof Bhandari,"" said a professor. He added that the wrong doer must be identified and penalised."

LUCKNOW: CB-CID magistrate Abid Shamim on Monday ordered release of five accused who are in jail in connection with arson and riot at the house of UP Congress Committee chief Rita Bahuguna Joshi, on personal bond and a surety of Rs 20,000.Guddu Yadav, Shiv Kumar Singh, Indu Singh alias Pappu, Zamir Khan, Surajjit Kumar Tiwari had been booked by the CB-CID for indulging in arson and riot on July 15. A servant of Joshi lodged an FIR in this connection alleging involvement of some BSP leaders/politicians and police officers. After a nation-wide outrage over the case, the state government handed over the probe to the CB-CID. It arrested the said accused and put them behind bars.On Monday, arguing on behalf of the accused, advocate GN Shukla said that there was no evidence against the accused. Till date, the CB-CID had not been able to collect even an iota of evidence against them. Therefore, the remand of the accused should not be extended any more and they should be set at liberty forthwith, pleaded Shukla.Hearing the application to refuse the remand of the accused, the court did not find prima-facie evidence against them and hence also did not find it proper to keep them in jail any longer. The court accordingly ordered release of all the accused on a personal bond and single surety. The court directed the accused to cooperate in the investigation."

LUCKNOW: Date: July 15, 2009. Site: 45, Sarojini Naidu Marg residence of UPCC president Reeta Joshi Bahuguna. Two policemen ��� SP (east) and circle officer, Hazratganj emerged on the scene around 10.30 pm. A huge jerrycan containing inflammable oil was smuggled into the house. Then entered a strong band of hoodlums, who set the apartment on fire. The drama, that lasted for over three hours, put the UP police in shame, the Mayawati government under cloud and democracy in tatters.This graphic description of the incident was given in the Vidhan Sabha by Congress legislature party (CLP) leader Pramod Tewari, who said : ���The rest is now a history that the Mayawati government will find difficult to escape from.��� While demanding a CBI probe into the incident, he said the government���s role was questionable, as it had taken no action against the erring police officials and rewarded Intezar Abdi, a BSP activist and ���accused��� in the incident with a ministerial post soon after the incident.Incidentally, chief minister Mayawati who was present in the beginning when the issue was raised, did not attend the House when it witnessed uproar over the issue. She also passingly referred to June 2, 1995 incident in which she was put under siege at the state guest house and said that this was also probed by the CB-CID.���This was no ordinary incident. The government had not only torched a house, but also the democracy that had propelled Mayawati to this height,��� Pramod Tewari said, while speaking on the admissibility of his adjournment notice."

GUWAHATI/KATIHAR: The backlash against the attack on Assamese train passengers in Bihar continued on Sunday morning. Miscreants torched five more houses belonging to Biharis in the Gauhati University campus on Sunday.Several vehicles were damaged by miscreants on Saturday night.City additional superintendent of police Bibekananda Das told Times News Network the five houses were gutted completely after miscreants torched them around 11 am on Sunday. ""No one has been hurt,"" he added.On Saturday night, a large group of miscreants damaged about 20 vehicles in the Fancy Bazar area during a show. The miscreants fled from the scene as soon as the police arrived.Meanwhile, the second round of examinations for Group D posts in the Northeast Frontier Railway conducted by the Railway Recruitment Board and the Union government''s Staff Selection Board (SSB) tests were held here on Sunday, amid tight security.During the first round of the railway examination on November 9, local youths had prevented Bihari students from taking the test, leading to attacks on train passengers from the North-East by miscreants in Bihar. Tight security arrangements were made at examination centres, hotels and railway stations.Reacting to the All-Assam Students'' Union''s charge that the Railways is breaching a job reservation agreement made in 1988, the North-east Frontier (NF) Railway authorities sought to clarify on Sunday that ""raking up the 1988 agreement at this crucial time is unfortunate,"" since the Supreme Court, by a verdict in 1998, has made all categories of railway posts open to all Indian citizens.A statement by NF Railway''s chief PR officer said, ""The department of personnel, Government of India, instructed the ministry of railways to immediately implement the verdict of the court and the railways as a whole, including the NF Railways, is now legally bound to implement it."""

kolkata: senior kolkata police officials said on thursday that the biswaroopa fire was a case of arson, and not an accident. our initial investigation based on apparent observations reveal that the historic stage was set ablaze, deputy commissioner (detective department) soumen mitra said. the state government had asked for forensic tests to be completed before deciding on forming a probe committee, chief minister buddhadeb bhattacharjee added. two persons — real estate promoter ramesh chandra bothra and guard of the theatre jagdish mahato — have been arrested. although the hall had been closed for four years, ample evidence had been found that people were living inside. while the door was under lock-and-key and the shutters were down, a number of openings had been created by breaking through the walls. we have found a number of used mattresses and pillows, fire service minister pratim chatterjee said. the fire brigade has submitted its report, and the police report will come in on friday. we will have to wait for the forensic report to decide whether it is necessary to probe the incident further, bhattacharjee said at the secretariat. initial investigation revealed that the current lease-holder of the theatre, located on a prime 54-cottah plot, was jayanti mishra of raja basanta roy road. after the fire, bothra's associate ashoke agarwala remained untraced. the police found bothra's bandana real estate pvt ltd office on armenian lane locked from outside. pratim chatterjee's statements indicated that there was a strong suspicion of foul play in the fire. we received the news at 1.25 am, and five engines reached the spot within 10 minutes. but by then, the fire had spread all over. my officers have told me that they believe the news reached them late, otherwise the fire could not have spread so much, he said. since these old buildings did not have much iron content as supporting material, and were mostly made of brick and mortar, such fires damaged the entire structure, he added. chatterjee felt that much of the damage could have been prevented if the mob which had gathered did not obstruct the firefighters. a number of our fire engines and firemen were led into a small bylane and held there for quite some time. many of our men were injured in scuffles. a lot of expensive equipment have been stolen and damaged, he said. this was not the first time that the fire brigade was hampered in its duty. even when rangmahal theatre was up in flames, a crowd stopped us from getting on with the work. do these people have a vested interest in destroying these buildings? chatterjee wondered. the fire brigade has lodged an fir with the burtola police station. these people must be brought to book, he said."

KOLKATA: The mysterious fire at the office of the West Bengal minorities development commission at Bhawani Bhavan in Kolkata on October 28 was an act of arson, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said in the state assembly on Thursday. In reply to a question from opposition leader Pankaj Banerjee, he said the forensic report into the fire had revealed that it was an arson, not an accidental fire like short circuit. A case was started at the Alipore police station on December 17 on the basis of the forensic report. Describing the development as ""a serious one"", Bhattacharjee said the responsibility of the inquiry would not be left only to the Alipore police station. Senior police officials, too, would be involved in it. He could not fix a date by which the investigations would be completed. Trinamul leader Saugata Roy said there were serious doubts if the office premises was not set on fire deliberately to destroy papers relating to loans given to the minority community in the period between February and April, prior to the last Lok Sabha poll. In this period, loans were disbursed at random for purchase of autos and taxis, without proper documents, he alleged. It may be mentioned that immediately after the fire, Trinamul leaders in a Press conference had made similar allegations. Denying the allegations, Bhattacharjee said it was not correct to say that loans had been disbursed with a political motive. Preliminary investigations did not point to the possibility that the office was set on fire in such a fashion that politically significant documents were destroyed. Though a number of documents were destroyed in the fire and the water that the fire brigade used to douse it, all of them had a ""complete back-up in hard copies,"" the chief minister said. Out of 15 computers in the office, eight were burnt in the fire."

LUCKNOW: Over a dozen were injured as people went berserk on Tuesday over police refusal to lodge FIR regarding a minor's rape on Monday in Mainpuri.

The irate mob torched three buses, a police jeep and offices of Circle Officer (CO) and sub-divisional magistrate (SDM). The traffic on the GT Road too was thrown out of gear.

Trouble began when hundreds of locals, protesting against police refusal to lodge an FIR about the rape of a minor girl on Monday, lost their cool.

The police, who had allegedly refused to register the rape case, however rounded up over a dozen persons on charges of rioting and arson after the violence.

It all began on Monday when a nine-year-old girl who had accompanied a baraat to a school campus in Bhogaon was allegedly kidnapped and raped by a peon of the school.

The incident came to light when the girl told her parents about the incident after escaping from the accused who had held her hostage.

The family members and guests who had come to attend the marriage ceremony, searched the peon, identified as Govind. Allegations are that instead of lodging an FIR, the police asked the family members to search for Govind themselves...

...

When locals reached the police station on Tuesday morning to request lodging of an FIR, police allegedly waved it away.

This sparked off widespread resentment and locals joined by people from far-flung areas who were passing from the site, staged a protest outside the local police station.

When there was no response from police, the mob shifted to GT Road and blocked the highway demanding immediate arrest of the peon.

The protesters lost cool and began pelting stones at the passing vehicles. Soon violence broke out and chaos prevailed.

By the time police could ""reach"" the site, the mob had already torched three UP State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) buses.

As the circle officer (CO) was the first among the officers to reach the site, he had to bear the brunt. The protesters even torched the officer's jeep.

While this was underway, a section of the mob marched towards office of CO and SDM and torched the premises. Before fire could be extinguished, a section of the two offices was reduced to ashes.

The situation was brought under control around 4.30 pm after CO and SDM assured early arrest of the accused. Though the road blockade was lifted on assurance, tension was palpable in the area.

Additional forces were rushed from Etah and other adjoining districts to take control of the situation. Further details are awaited."

LUCKNOW: The King George's Medical University (KGMU) on Thursday suspended five more students, whose names have figured in the January 12 arson on the campus.

All these students are from MBBS 2002 batch and are alleged to be part of the 2 mob which attacked the vice-chancellor's residence and set the administrative block on fire.

The accused students Mukesh Kumar, Surendra Singh, Ram Kishore Rajput, Pankaj Tyagi and Sumit Kaushik have been expelled from the hostels with immediate effect.

Though, they have been allowed to appear in the examinations, their results will be declared only after they are cleared by the inquiry committee.

Earlier, 36 students were suspended by the KGMU in January, soon after the incident. Significantly, out of total 41 students accused of arson on the campus, most are of 2002 batch, which raises doubts over Combined Pre-Medical Test (CPMT) 2002.

Interestingly, all the five students suspended on Thursday were among the top in the merit list of the CPMT 2002, but their academic record in KGMU internal examinations reflects otherwise.

Sample this: Sumit Kaushik cleared CPMT at first attempt with sixth rank. However, the 'meritorious' candidate failed in all subjects in the first professional examinations held in October 2003.

Though, he cleared first year in March 2004 but again failed in one subject in second professional examinations in September 2005.

Pankaj Tyagi qualified CPMT in fourth attempt and was placed 20th in the merit list. He, too, failed in all the subjects in first professional examinations, passed in the second attempt in March 2004 but again failed in two subjects in the second professional examinations.

It took Surendra Singh (scheduled caste candidate) five attempts to qualify CPMT. He got 45th rank in the merit list. However, he also failed in all the subjects in first professional.

Somehow, he cleared subjects in the second attempt, but failed again in all the subjects in second professional examinations.

RK Rajput qualified CPMT in sixth attempt. He was placed 49th in the merit list. He failed in first professional and later cleared it in second attempt. Mukesh Kumar qualified CPMT in third attempt.

He got 24th position in the merit list. He took two attempts to clear first professional and again failed in all the subjects in second professional. He is also said to be close to Dr KK Singh, prime accused in arson case.

All these students, KGMU authorities said, have dubious records. The name of one of them had also figured in a kidnapping case."

AHMEDABAD/GANDHINAGAR: The â€˜Gujarat bandhâ€™ call by farmers under the Gujarat Khedut Sangharsh Samiti (GKSS), on Friday, saw some ugly scenes as protesting farmers set ablaze two state transport buses in Ahmedabad district.Thousands of farmers courted arrest all over the state even as some were booked for rioting in the outskirts of Ahmedabad. Although the response was lukewarm in the urban centres, â€˜rasta rokoâ€™ agitations held up traffic in many rural parts of the state in North and South Gujarat.The samiti had the complete support of the Congress party and continues to protest against the power tariff hike by the Modi government, unlike the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), which has come around.In the Bhayla and Sari villages of Bavla taluka in Ahmedabad district, two ST buses were burnt, although nobody was hurt. Earlier in the day, the farmers blocked the Ahmedabad-Bavla road, under the leadership of GKSS president Ravji Patel.The police arrested 26 persons in these cases, of which two turned out to be residents of Sarkhej, said SP (Ahmedabad district) Manoj Agrawal. In Banaskantha, the farmers went on a rampage, blocking roads with tree trunks and unloading truckloads of sand on the highway to arrest traffic.According to GKSS convenor Bipin Desai, in Surendranagar, Congress MLA Manubhai Makwana who joined in the protests, was also arrested while sitting MP Savshi Makwana too led some 700 protesters on the highway. Several farmers were detained near Jhadeshwar and Nikora chowkdi in Bharuch district.In Surat district, barring sporadic attempts to disrupt traffic on the NH-6 and NH-8 highways, no untoward incidents were reported. Around 150 persons were detained, including 80 at Bardoli, said SP (Surat district) D J Patel.Some shops and commercial establishments remained closed at Kamrej, Palsana, Olpad, Bardoli and others parts of the district, according to GKSS. At Palsana and Kamrej, 54 persons were detained by the police, even as â€˜rasta rokoâ€™ agitations marked the protests in Kadodara and Olpad.The response in Saurashtra region was â€˜mixedâ€™, as barely any shops remained closed in Rajkot, Jamnagar and Amreli districts.Villages of Junagadh, Bhavnagar, Porbandar,Bhavnagar and Surendranagar saw partial response to the bandh and staged dharnas and â€˜rasta rokoâ€™ agitations. Over 200 persons were arrested from these areas. Traffic was blocked near Limdi for at least 90 minutes. The BJP termed the bandh a big â€˜flopâ€™ show even as state law minister criticised the Congress for supporting the bandh.(Inputs from Surat, Rajkot and Vadodara)"

AHMEDABAD: Riot victims can breathe a sigh of relief as the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) has said that looting is covered under the standard fire policy. Being the highest authority for insurance companies in the country, chairman N Rangachary has also asked the Tariff Regulatory Committee (TAC) to issue a clarification in this regard.It was the TAC which had opined that looting cannot be covered under the standard fire policy leading to panic among riot victims. The clarification should come as a relief to hundreds of riot victims whose shops and establishments had been looted during the recent riots. Insurance companies had so far refused to pay insurance claims for looting saying that only arson was covered under the policy.Explaining why looting should not be exempt, Rangachary says that if riot as a peril has been covered by the policy, then looting during a riots too should get the same cover. ""It is not disputed that looting has followed the riots in these cases,"" he says. ""The issue would be whether we should not take into account the proximate cause of the looting. If loss arises on account of looting in a riot where the riot peril itself is an insured peril, there should not be any difficulty in meeting the claim under the policy.""""Had the insurance companies stuck to a literal interpretation of the Standard Fire and Special Perils (Material Damage) policy, about 3,500 claims of over 5,600 claims that we have received would have been adversely affected,"" says Manoj Shah, manager of the New India Assurance Company. He also acts as co-ordinator for the nationalised insurance firms during calamities when the claims are high. Victims would have received payment for damage to their shop and furniture only, not for the goods looted by the mob.""Now that the confusion has been removed, all regional managers of the companies will meet on Tuesday to ask surveyors to hasten their work."" Up to June 27, the nationalised firms had received 5,624 claims worth Rs 174 crore. Of these 1,623 claims have been cleared and Rs 21.39 paid.The New India Assurance Company was in fact one of the first company to say that looting can be covered. According to them, there was already a precedent as looting was covered in the 1984 Delhi riots and the 1992 Mumbai riots."

AHMEDABAD: The mobs that prowled the streets of Gujarat, looting shops and business establishments, didn''t perhaps realise that they were inflicting more damage to the victims than the arsonists who were simply setting the shops ablaze.As things stand today, thousands of insurance policy holders, whose establishments were simply looted and ransacked, may end up getting measly sums from insurance companies because they didn''t read the fine print. Looting is not covered under insurance policies which the riot victims had taken as cover for any untoward eventuality.Promises made by government officials and insurance companies that the riot victims will be compensated fully have a hollow ring about it. The Tariff Advisory Committee (TAC) for the insurance sector has opined that looting cannot be covered under the Standard Fire and Special Perils (Material Damage) policy. The result is more than 50 per cent of the victims are likely to see their claims reduced to paltry amounts. They will be paid for the damage to their property, but receive nothing for the goods looted.Unfortunately, most victims have stated in FIRs that their shops and houses were first looted and then burnt. Even shops in posh areas, like Pantaloons and Metro Shoes, suffered heavy losses in the looting frenzy. In many of these cases, victims are unlikely to receive more than a tenth of their claim, sources in insurance companies say.""They have added insult to injury,"" says managing director of the Maniar group, Shafi Maniar, well known for the Maniar Tyre store chain. ""More than 80 per cent of our investment is in stocks. If they don''t pay insurance on the looted goods, we will be left with nothing."" The Maniar group has put in a claim of Rs 75 lakh.Wahid Saiyad, on the other hand, lost most of the raw material and ready goods from his plastics factory near Prantij. Rioters carried away whatever they could and then set the machinery ablaze. Saiyad put in a claim of about Rs 35 lakh, but this would be slashed by almost half if the looting clause is affected.Insurance companies have given surveyors the responsibility of bifurcating looting and arson in each case. ""This is humanly not possible,"" says Nilesh Bhimani of Bhimani and Co, a surveyor who has seen nearly 40 per cent of the cases returned for bifurcation. ""For starters, rioting lasted for nearly three months and we surveyed the shops and houses many days later because of the curfew. It is impossible to prove what was stolen and what was only burnt.""Assistant general manager of the National Insurance Company R K Kaul, however, says: ""The matter has been referred to the government and we are hopeful it will be resolved sympathetically.""Despite being the smallest among the large insurance companies, National Insurance has received 1,205 claims worth Rs 54 crore. Sources add that of the nearly 5,000 claims filed in Gujarat, about 3,500 are likely to be affected because of the exclusion of looting.Insurance company officials admit that when the standard fire policy was amended last year with this new norm, they paid no attention to it because no one expected another riot in the near future. As a result, when the riots broke out on February 28, they were caught off-guard."

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday stayed the death sentence awarded to three AIADMK supporters who had set fire to a university bus in 2000 while protesting their leader Jayalalithaa's conviction in the Pleasant Stay Hotel case, leading to the death of 3 girl students.

Admitting the appeals filed by the three — Nedunche-zhiyan, Ravichandran and P Muniappan who challenged the Madras High Court order sustaining the capital punishment — a bench comprising Justices P P Naolekar and L S Panta issued notice to the state and stayed the death penalty.

The HC had on December 6 last year found no fault with the February 6, 2007 order of the trial court convicting the three for murder and 25 others for various charges of assault and causing grievous injury to the students of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, who were travelling in the bus.

It was alleged that the three had cornered the bus at Dharmapuri in Salem district on February 3, 2000, poured petrol inside as well as outside and set it afire. The HC, while maintaining the conviction and sentence, had said ""various judgments of the SC show that imposition of death penalty is resorted to in the rarest of rare cases."

AURANGABAD: Police allegedly deflated the tyres of private ambulances on the GMCH premises here and also assaulted the drivers on Wednesday, leaving many, especially the medical fraternity, shocked.It is alleged that personnel from the Begumpura police were involved in the incident at the GMCH around noon, which is the largest state-run hospital in the region.The drivers alleged that the policemen deflated the tyres of at least half a dozen ambulances, before caning some of them, who sought to know the reason for their action.The action against the drivers and targeting of ambulances, which have been marked as essential services during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, has attracted serious criticism from different quarters.Moreover, the action is directly in contrast to the state government and police’s stand over using force against those who are part of essential services and commoners stepping out of home to buy essential goods. Some of the drivers suspect that Wednesday’s police action is a result of one of the ambulance drivers getting into a heated argument with an employee of GMCH.“The class-IV employee of GMCH abused one of our drivers over parking of an ambulance on Tuesday. The driver took a strong objection to the abuse, which resulted into a heated argument,” said a driver.Driver Pradip Shinde said, “Ambulances are essential services and policemen deflating tyres is against the norm.”The drivers unanimously expressed concern over the incident and said that police’s act would have cost some emergency patient his/her life. “Had there been some emergency and movement of a patient, or an accident, we would have been helpless due to the deflated tyres,” said another driver.Driver Azhar Khan said that they had to remove the deflated tyres and go to a nearby shop to fill air and put them back. “This consumed at least two hours. Police should realise that every minute is precious at GMCH, which is the largest government-run hospital in the region.”When contacted, assistant commissioner of police (city) HS Bhapkar said, “Deflating tyres of ambulances, prima facie appears to be very serious. We are looking into it. It'll be brought to the notice of seniors, following which they will decide on the course of action.”Begumpura police station inspector Sachin Sanap could not be reached for comment despite repeated attempts."

MEERUT: Kin of AAP leader Amanatullah Khan , who won from the Okhla constituency, have alleged that a team of the Uttar Pradesh police barged into their Meerut house on Tuesday night, hurled abuses and assaulted the family members and also misbehaved with the women for celebrating the victory . The women alleged that the policemen pulled them by their hair and dragged them out of the house and ""paraded"" them in the village on the pretext of locating the male members of their family who had fled to escape the police.Station officer of Parikshitgarh Police Station, Kailash Chandra, refuted the allegations, saying some villagers were trying to take out a victory procession despite being told that CrPC section 144 was in place in the area. An FIR has been filed against the family for ""violating prohibitory orders,"" he said.“We received information that a group of people were planning to take out a procession to celebrate the victory of AAP's Amanatullah Khan. We asked them not to as prohibitory orders were in place but they would not listen. So we booked 13 of them, including Noorullah Khan, under IPC section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant). There is no truth in the allegation that the police team assaulted the family members at night,” said Chandra.The incident allegedly took place in Agwanpur village of Meerut. Twenty-year-old Zainab Khan, who claimed the police misbehaved with her, said, “On Tuesday afternoon we were distributing sweets to celebrate the victory of my uncle Amanatullah Khan. My father, Noorullah Khan, who is also a social activist, was resting when a police jeep came and asked for him. He came out and tried to explain that youngsters were celebrating the victory and there was nothing illegal about it. But the cops would not relent. They hurled abuses at him and tried to push him into the police vehicle. At night, police came again, barged into our house and asked for my uncle. When we said he was not in, they pulled our hair and dragged me and my cousin (Najmi) out of the house.”Najmi Khan added, “They hurdled filthy abuses at us; one of them pointed a gun at me, brandished a lathi and threatened me with dire consequences if I did not reveal details of my uncle Noorullah Khan's whereabouts. Then they paraded me in the village, abusing me and asking where my uncle was.""When TOI contacted Noorullah Khan, he said, “I do not know why I am being framed in a fake case. I have no criminal record. My nephew, Amanatullah Khan, has won the Delhi assembly elections and there were some celebrations outside our house. There was no procession.”IG Praveen Tripathi said, “I am not aware of the alleged police brutality against the women. If there is a complaint regarding the matter, I will certainly order an inquiry. The police team did stop the family members of Noorullah from taking out a procession without permission, for which they were booked.”Amanatullah Khan won with a margin of over 71,000 votes from Okhla, where Shaheen Bagh is located."

KOLKATA: The police, who are probing the assault on doctors at the NRS Hospital in 2019 , are likely to seek legal guidance from Lalbazar after three attempts to record the statements of doctors failed.Though eight people were arrested in connection with the case, none of the key witnesses recorded their statements, making it difficult for the police to file a chargesheet and for the accused to get bail. ""At present, the case has gone off the priority list. But it has not been shelved. We are keeping the court updated about the case,"" said a police officer. What has come as the biggest setback so far is the cops' failure to convince junior doctors Paribaha Mukhopadhyay and Yash Tekwani to record their statements, despite three notices being served to them under CrPC 91. ""We need the statements to be recorded before a magistrate. We are yet to speak to Mukhopadhyay in detail about the case,"" said the officer.As per the CrPC 91, whenever any court or any officer-in-charge of a police station considers that the production of any document or statement is necessary for any investigation, inquiry, trial or other proceeding under this Code, summons or written order may be issued to a person or persons in this regard.""The police went to him multiple times, but were informed that he was still recovering and was not in a position to record his statement. Some other doctors of the hospital have also requested the two to be witnesses in the case,"" sources said."

PUNE: A 50-year-old drifter, known to many residents and business persons on Prabhat Road and Deccan area as ‘John Baba’, was found brutally assaulted and injured on the Riverbed Road early on Thursday morning.Senior inspector Deepak Lagad of the Deccan Gymkhana police station told TOI, “John Baba is from an educated family. Nevertheless, for unknown reasons, he started staying on the pavements and worked as a waiter at prominent restaurants in the area. Later, he gave up the job and started begging. He is a graduate and would often converse in English with local traders, restaurant customers, and others. John also has a penchant for crisp, clean branded clothes.”The police are trying to locate John’s relatives. As of now, he has been admitted to Sassoon General Hospital and doctors said he is out of danger.Lagad said, “The assault took place under Sambhaji Bridge on the riverbed road around 12.30am. Usually, the area remains crowded at the time owing to the eateries and tonga operators active in the stretch. Unidentified assailant(s) attempted to smash John’s head with a brick. Local traders and a police patrol team rushed to the spot on hearing his screams.”“We have registered a case of attempt to murder although the motive behind the crime is yet to be established,” Lagad said.Local businessman Manpreet Singh said, “John is a good human being. He greets everyone with a smile. The residents of Prabhat Road know him very well.”“Some people from Prabhat Road and Fergusson College Road informed us that he belongs to a good family and he used to stay in a house on Prabhat Road. But his past is obscure,” Lagad said. “We have appealed local residents to come forward and help the police track his relatives,” he added.According to the police, John Baba and two others, including a scrap collector, had been staying under the bridge. “John did not have any addiction. He would buy tea and snacks from the local shopkeepers instead of begging for food. He used to seek alms from passers-by,” Lagad said. One of the two men who used to stay beneath the bridge has been missing for the last two days, the police said."

MUMBAI: A UK national has been booked for allegedly assaulting policemen early on Sunday. He was allegedly drunk at the time of the incident.But Dashani Shree Kotak (32), an MBA professional employed with an international marketing firm, claimed he was trying to stop a fight between two men outside a Vile Parle pub near the domestic airport, when the police detained him instead of taking action against them. Kotak, who suffered injuries on the eye, chin and lips, said the cops punched him, but the police claimed he first assaulted constables Nitesh Dandge (33) and Umesh Shelar at Airport police station.“A case has been registered and a complaint will be filed at the UK consulate,” said additional commissioner of police (West) Manoj Sharma, adding that the CCTV footage retrieved from the police station clearly shows Kotak first assaulting the constables.Kotak had come to Mumbai last month. Late on Saturday, he and his fiancee went to Barrel Mansion pub. Kotak’s fiancee said when they were leaving the place, they saw two men fighting near the exit. “Kotak only intervened in the fight,” she claimed. “But the policemen who reached the spot couldn’t communicate properly in English, while Kotak does not understand Hindi. This led to confusion and the police detained him and took him in an autorickshaw to the police station. Now they have cooked up a story to save themselves from the consequences of assaulting a UK national. This is police gundagiri.”A 32-second CCTV clip from the area shows the cops pulling Kotak out of an autorickshaw, grabbing his collar and taking him to Airport police station. Kotak’s brother Rick told TOI that the cops punched and thrashed him in the rickshaw. “The pub’s security guards called the police and they abused my brother and took him to the police station instead of taking action against the two men who were fighting.” He claimed that Kotak was ‘illegally detained’ for over two hours.But Sharma said: “Kotak was taken to the police station because he intervened in police duty and got abusive when asked to step aside. When brought to the police station, he assaulted the policemen.” A three-minute CCTV footage from the police station showed three constables asking Kotak to sit in a corner. “The footage clearly showed that Kotak twice slapped, spat and even kicked Dandge in the groin. Hence, the cops retaliated and tried to control Kotak who was drunk,” said zonal DCP Ganesh Shinde.Both Kotak and constable Dandge were discharged from hospital after treatment.A staffer from Barrel Mansion told TOI they were unaware about the incident."

Miscreants are striking at ease,” said Prabodh Mohanty, a social media user.The alleged assault comes in the backdrop of the daylight attack on a Sikh businessman in Laxmisagar area of the city in January.Opposition BJP and Congress reacted sharply on the issue. “It is disgraceful and shocking to see miscreants assaulting a woman in public. What could be worse than this? This has put a question mark on the law and order situation,” tweeted senior BJP leader Bhrugu Baxipatra.State Congress president Niranjan Patnaik also took to twitter to target the police over the worsening law and order situation. “Govt has failed to protect its citizens, especially women & girls.

The identity of the accused is known. The attack is over a land dispute. Action under law is being taken,” read a tweet from the DCP’s office."

NEW DELHI: A fast-track court has sentenced a senior citizen to five years in jail for sexually assaulting seven-year old girl , observing he was guilty of crippling her childhood and deserved to be taken to task without leniency.Additional sessions judge Seema Maini said sexual assault inhibits every kind of growth of the child, leaving the child either as a “nervous wreck” or a “mental” and “emotional dwarf”.In its verdict, the court stated that sexual assault did not only affect a child physically and emotionally but also psychologically. “The psychological assault corrodes the inner being of the child, slowly but steadily, leaving deep embedded scars, which though not visible to the naked eye, get manifested in the child’s future actions, reactions and emotions. Such a sexually assaulted child develops fear psychosis, withdrawal symptoms as well as shiftiness in behaviour,” the court said.The man was convicted under Section 10 (aggravated sexual assault) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and slapped him with a fine of Rs 10,000. The prosecution alleged that in 2013, the man — who was the girl’s neighbour — entered her house on finding her alone, gagged her and raped her.The girl’s aunt raised an alarm when she came downstairs on seeing that the accused had confined the minor in a room. The woman got the door opened. The minor survivor narrated her ordeal to her aunt on the basis of which the police registered a case against the man."

MADURAI: A counter case registered against a postgraduate (PG) doctor by the two women who assaulted the doctor at a labour ward in Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) was closed by the police on Friday.On December 14, a patient’s kin attacked a PG doctor, Dr Malathi in the maternity ward after they were denied entry into a sterile ward with her footwear on. The doctors and hospital staff staged a protest in the campus after this incident.In response, an FIR was registered against the accused Raja Rajeshwari and Murugeshwari under the Tamil Nadu Hospital Protection Act 2008 based on the PG doctor’s complaint. The accused were also later arrested.Reportedly at the same time, an FIR was also registered against Dr Malathi based on the complaint given by the two women.“However, nobody had any knowledge of it including the GRH authorities till now. The police had not consulted with anyone before registering the FIR. This in fact suggests a loophole in the Tamil Nadu Hospital Protection Act 2008 putting doctors at risk of having counter cases filed against them. Immediately, we convened a meeting and demanded the police to close the case,” said one of the PG doctors at GRH.On the other hand, police sources said that the counter-FIR was registered as per due process but the counter case has been closed now after talks with GRH dean Dr Sangumani J as well. “There was no evidence found to substantiate the two women’s complaints, according to the investigating officer. The accused were also not admitted to hospital. So, the counter case has been closed now,” said a police source."

NEW DELHI/WASHINGTON: The government rejected the observations on India in the USCIRF annual report, which had accused India of allowing harassment of Muslims and violence against them, saying the US federal government entity’s misrepresentation of India had reached new levels.The report on India was rejected by two of its own commissioners. “Its biased and tendentious comments against India are not new. But on this occasion, its misrepresentation has reached new levels,” MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), which claims to monitor religious freedom around the world, asked the state department to designate 14 nations, including India, as countries of particular concern ( CPC ), alleging that religious minorities were under increasing assault in these nations.However, two of its nine members expressed dissent over USCIRF recommendation to place India in the CPC."

MUMBAI: In a relief to a flyer convicted for an offence of sexual assault on a child actor mid-air Bombay high court on Tuesday granted him bail after admitting his appeal against the guilty verdict of a trial court.The appeal by a former entertainment firm executive, Vikas Sachdeva came up before a bench of Justice Prithviraj Chavan of the high court who suspended the sentence and granted bail of Rs 25,000 with two solvent sureties of like amount.The high court also directed that he cannot leave the city without court permission.A special trial court judge A D Deo had on January 15 held Sachdeva, 41, guilty under section 8 under of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. The accusation was that he put his foot and touched a 17-year-old co-passenger, sitting in front in the business class, on her shoulder and neck on a flight from Delhi to Mumbai in December 2017. The trial court relied on the complainant’s deposition to nail him.The trial court had sentenced him to three years’ imprisonment fined him Rs 25,000 but granted him bail under the provisions of law.Justice Chavan first asked why should a Pocso victim be disbelieved and why would she lie.Sachdeva’s counsel Aniket Nikam argued that there was ""no independent evidence to support the case of the victim and her deposition is shrouded with omissions and improvements"". He submitted that there is ""contradiction between the version of the complainant and other eyewitnesses,"" and that crew members had ""categorically deposed"" that the accused was found sleeping throughout the flight and no such incident was noticed by them.Nikam also submitted that the victim herself or her mother never made any complaint to the crew members while on the flight and added that it was only after social media post that the police lodged the crime.He argued that the bail granted was to him and he deserved bail pending the hearing of his appeal.The prosecutor opposed the grant of bail saying it was a serious case under Pocso. The first appeal against conviction is admitted as a right but the flyer wanted his bail to continue.His appeal, however, challenged the conviction on various grounds, including that it is wrong on the appreciation of facts, circumstances and the evidence, produced during trial.The argument was also that it was ""unlikely that leg would have touched the victims shoulder taking into consideration the distance between the two business class seats"" It was submitted that the fact that there was a lot of space on the right and left side of the seat after the ""victim occupied the said seat"" must be considered.""Leg cannot be like a snake and take turns in the fashion in which it is alleged,"" said Nikam.The conviction is ""contrary to the established principles of law,"" and that the trial court has ""erred"" as it ""overlooked glaring contradiction omission, as well as admissions and improvements that were brought to the notice of the Judge”, said the appeal.""Judgment is based totally on hypothecation, imagination, conjuncture and surmises and not at all on the evidence on record,"" added the appeal. The flyer was in custody for 11 days after his arrest on December 10, 2017, and has been on bail since.The trial court had while convicting him said, ""The incident as deposed by the victim of inappropriate explicit touch by male accused in the journey is a very common sexual assault experience by every common woman travelling in public transport. The present case would reflect that such experience is not an exception in the most elite mode of transportation, that too in business class""."

BATHINDA: Punjab jails minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa has ordered an investigation into the December 30 assault on a farmer union’s vice-president in Faridkot jail.Randhawa said he had asked ADGP (jails) to find how a gangster and his henchmen beat up the inmate, Kirti Kisan Union vice president Rajinder Singh. An officer of the rank of deputy inspector general of police (DIG) has been asked to inquire into the matter and fix responsibility of the jail staff.Speaking to TOI, Randhawa said, “I had taken up the matter with ADGP (jails) and asked him to get the matter probed. The ADGP has deputed a DIG-level officer to investigate by concentrating on talking to the inmate who was beaten up and those who were around. We will reach to the bottom of the matter and anyone found guilty of dereliction of duty will be taken to task.”Rajinder was attacked in the jail on December 30 evening. With blunt injuries on the body, he was admitted to Guru Gobind Singh Medical College, Faridkot. Nishan Singh, who is serving a life sentence for abducting and raping a minor girl, is behind the attack. A case has been registered against Nishan and 17 others.Farmer organisation activists KKU president Nirbhay Singh Dhudike and BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri said it was a matter of serious concern how Nishan and his accomplices were allowed to go near Rajinder, who had been fighting for justice all through his life.While he was the president of a faction of Punjab Students Union, Rajinder was at the forefront of protests against abduction and rape of a minor girl in Faridkot by Nishan in 2012. Due to the sustained struggle by him and other activists, police had arrested Nishan from Goa along with the girl.He was sentenced to life imprisonment in May 2013. Late,r Nishan and his mother were made to pay a compensation of Rs 90 lakh to the survivor’s family as damages. PSU activists claimed that Nishan wanted to take revenge from Rajinder for the role he played in the struggle.Meanwhile, a four-member team of the Democratic Lawyers Association (DLA) on Wednesday met Faridkot jail superintendent and made investigations. Association member Rajiv Lohatbaddi alleged it seemed some jail officials were hand in glove with Nishan.“We have tried to make assessment after meeting the jail superintendent and will hand over our report to the chief justice of Punjab and Haryana high court,” he said."

Hyderabad: A farmer from Balkonda of Nizamabad district has appealed the state human rights commission (SHRC) to take actions against a sub-inspector for thrashing him and his father. The SHRC has sought a report on the incident from Nizamabad police commissioner by June 29.“I am unaware about the nature of the injuries suffered by the farmer but I don’t think they were grievous. However, there was use of force by one of the officers and I have directed an ACP rank officer to conduct enquiry and submit a report,” commissioner Kartikeya told TOI.The farmer, G Harish, said his father Rajender was returning home on April 19 at around 8.30 am after attending to his fields. “Enroute, my father went to the market. The police took the keys of his bike so he went to the station and waited for sub-inspector till 11.30 am. When the SI turned up, my father was beaten up for asking for the keys,” Harish said.Harish went to the police station when he came to know that his father was there. “The SI, Si Hari, started beating me with a lathi when I was about to enter the station. I was later kicked and beaten more. My father was also assaulted. This can be corroborated by CCTV footage from the police station,” added Harish.The farmer said his father was returning home after attending to his field, when the key of his vehicle was seized by the police. He was assaulted when he went to the police station"

KOLKATA: A day after a gynaecologist was assaulted at CMRI Hospital following the death of a young woman after childbrith, the Alipore police has registered an FIR on Friday against the accused under non-bailable sections to treat the assault as a cognizable offence.Police said they have slapped Section 4 of the West Bengal Protection of Medical Service Persons and Medical Service Institutions (Prevention of Violence and Damage or Loss of Property) Act, 2017 against the kin of the deceased based on a specific complaint from the doctor, Basab Mukherjee, who visited the police station on Thursday night and registered his written complaint.The development comes on the same day when sources claimed that the preliminary post mortem of the victim — Rinki Bhattacharya — primarily indicates pulmonary embolism (PE) leading to the cardiac arrest. PE is usually caused by blood clot that travels to the lungs of the person leading to blockage in one of the pulmonary arteries.“The preliminary post-mortem report does not point to any kind of dereliction on the part of the doctor,” said a source. Cops said the post-mortem report is critical to decide the fate of the case. The autopsy report will be submitted to the state health department as the woman’s family has lodged a complaint of medical negligence against the gynaecologist.Bhattacharya had given birth to a boy on Wednesday morning a little after 10am through C-section. Apparently fine after the childbirth, the death within 18 hours had led to her family alleging medical negligence.The FIR against the kin also has other IPC sections — 323 (hurt), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 114 (abettor present when offence is committed) — and has been forwarded to a city court. The police said the hospital has named an accused in their complaint, identified as Tapen Bhattacharya, the husband of the victim. A separate complaint has also been received in this regard from the hospital, said DC (south) Meeraz Khalid. The maximum punishment under the special law is imprisonment for a maximum of three years.“We will establish whether the same person is involved in the slapping incident,” said a senior officer. Sources said they will also follow legal procedures and ask the accused person to join the probe soon. “There is no pressing need for an arrest right now,” said the officer.The cops, meanwhile, said they have also received a complaint from the family claiming medical negligence. “According to norms, we have forwarded the complaint to the medical council. Once they give their views, we will lodge an FIR based on their recommendations,” said another officer.On Friday, various doctor organisations, including West Bengal Doctors’ Forum, visited the hospital asking the administration to pursue the case of assault on the doctor. “We will wait till the baby is discharged for the police to take action against Tapen Bhattacharya who assaulted the doctor. We demand arrest of the accused,” said oncologist Sharadwat Mukhopadhyay of DOPA (Doctors for Patients).The Bengal Obstetrics and Gynaecological Society (BOGS) has also decided to wait till the baby goes home before it decides on its next course of action. Meanwhile, hospital sources said the baby is doing fine and is likely to be discharged in the next few days.Bhattacharya, 30, a resident of Baguiati and wife of a businessman, was admitted to the hospital on Wednesday. Mukherjee conducted a C-section in the morning. Family members said the mother had appeared quite healthy when they saw her during the evening visiting hour. But Rinki developed severe respiratory distress around 3am on Thursday and died of a cardiac arrest soon after."

Times View Things have been improving after the measures taken following the NRS violence but this incident may prove to be a setback.

KOLKATA: The husband of a young woman, who died hours after she gave birth to a healthy boy, assaulted the gynaecologist who had delivered the baby at CMRI Hospital on Thursday morning, sparking widespread anger in the medical fraternity, with doctors seeking strict punishment for the accused.Rinki Bhattacharya, 30, was admitted to the hospital on Wednesday, where ob-gyn Basab Mukherjee conducted a C-section to deliver a boy in the morning. Family members said the mother had appeared quite healthy when they saw her during the evening visiting hour. But the Baguiati resident developed severe respiratory distress around 3am on Thursday and died of a cardiac arrest soon after.The family demanded an explanation from the doctor. Mukherjee was in the process of explaining the possible cause of her death, when her husband, Tapen Bhattacharya, lashed out and slapped him on the left cheek. The impact of the blow sent the doctor reeling. Uniformed policemen were present when the assault, captured on CCTV cameras, took place.Coming barely eight months after the vicious mob assault at NRS Medical College and Hospital on two junior doctors, the single slap on Thursday resounded far widely than just in the corridors of CMRI. News of the assault sent ripples through the medical fraternity. The NRS incident led to protracted protests and a government assurance on a clampdown on such attacks. The CMRI assault has again touched a raw nerve.Rinki had been under Basab Mukherjee’s care since she became pregnant. Accordingly, she was admitted to CMRI, with which the doctor is attached. The baby was delivered a little after 10am on Wednesday. The rest of the day was normal. According to hospital authorities, she suddenly complained of severe respiratory distress around 3am on Thursday and died of a cardiac arrest despite critical care support.Her relatives, who arrived early on Thursday, were initially stunned to learn of the death and began asking questions about what had happened to Rinki, since she was apparently in perfect health just a few hours ago. When the RMO’s explanations failed to satisfy them, the message was conveyed to Mukherjee, who volunteered to speak to the family. “The doctor arrived at the hospital earlier than usual when he learnt that the family wanted an explanation. He said he would try to explain what happened,” said a hospital source.The doctor then entered the patients’ counselling room and began speaking to a dozen-odd relatives of the deceased. As a precautionary measure, the hospital also called in the police, and two constables were present in the room. “The doctor was explaining the possible causes of death. When the relatives failed to see reason, he suggested an autopsy to determine the cause. It was at this point that the husband sprang up from a chair, leapt towards the doctor and slapped him on the face. The suddenness of the attack caught both the cops and the hospital security personnel unawares,” said a hospital staff.According to the family, Tapen turned furious at what he felt was “medical jargon”, instead of explaining in “simple terms” what had happened. “The doctor was trying to camouflage medical negligence with medical terms that none of us could understand,” alleged a family member. Tapen later said he was distraught and beyond himself on learning of the shocking loss. “How would anybody else have reacted under this circumstance?” Family members said Tapen later expressed remorse.The couple had got married two years ago, and this was their first child. According to relatives, their association with Dr Mukherjee’s family goes way back. Basudeb Mukherjee, his father, is also a gynaecologist and had helped deliver several newborns in the family, they said. “The death was unfortunate. However, physical violence on a doctor is unacceptable and will not be endured by the hospital,” read a statement by the hospital, which lodged a assault complaint with Alipore PS. Dr Mukherjee, too, has lodged an assault complaint with the cops.In Video: On cam: Man slaps doctor in Kolkata after relative dies following childbirth"

KOLKATA: Four persons hailing from Burtolla were arrested by the RG Kar Hospital police for allegedly assaulting and threatening the doctors and staff on duty at the transitional care unit (TCU) on Saturday.Police said the trouble started in the wee hours when the four came to the hospital with their relative, who suffered injuries on both hands, and demanded immediate treatment for him. Cops said that all four — identified as Suraj Poddar (23), Tukun Das (38), Somnath Das (19) and Suraj Khatik (20) — were in an inebriated condition.“It was only in the morning — around 9.30am — that we put them under arrest. A case under IPC sections pertaining to assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty and criminal intimidation has been registered against them,” said an IPS officer who is overseeing the probe. The Tallah police later slapped the stringent Section 4 of West Bengal Health Care Services Act, 2009.Police said that the four came with Dhiraj Kumar Jaiswal (40), who suffered bleeding injuries, probably a result of an argument between the five, around 12.45am. “They demanded immediate treatment. When the security asked only one person to accompany the patient, all hell broke loose. The accused shouted and then assaulted the staff. Soon, reinforcements were called in with OC Tallah himself rushing to the spot. Initially, we did not receive complaint, but the principal’s office finally lodged the complaint in the morning. We checked CCTV footage and arrested the accused,” said an officer.The incident comes even as a second security audit at government hospitals has already begun — it actually began last Tuesday at the RG Kar Hospital itself. It will cover other medical colleges like NRS Hospital and SSKM Hospital till November 11 after which a comprehensive report will be prepared and sent to the government with suggestions of further changes.“We found some minor issues with the private security arrangements there. These are being addressed,” claimed a source."

PATNA: The Gopalganj police on Thursday arrested two youths and took another minor boy into custody for their alleged involvement in the sexual assault and subsequent murder of a Class IX student of an upgraded government high school in the district on Monday.The victim’s body was recovered from the classroom of the school under the Barauli police station area of the district on Monday. The girl’s parents started searching for her when she didn’t reach home from the school till late in the evening. The body was later found hanging from the ceiling fan while the room was locked from outside.Acting on a tip-off, police arrested Ankit Kumar (18) and Niranjan Kumar alias Bhuwar (23) from Devapur village and detained a 17-year-old boy for interrogation. During interrogation, the trio admitted that they had hanged the body from the ceiling fan with her ‘dupatta’ after killing her in the classroom on Monday.Though the accused admitted that the girl’s modesty was outraged before being killed, the postmortem report will throw more light on this aspect. Gopalganj SDPO Naresh Paswan said, “The postmortem report is awaited. Rape will be confirmed after the receipt of the report,” he added.He, however, said that prima facie it seems to be a case of rape and murder. Ankit, a former student of the school, first entered the classroom when others students went to attend smart classes in another building around 2 pm on Monday. Two other students, including a minor boy, spotted Ankit and her girlfriend engaged in some unlawful activity and made a video of their act.The two later sexually assaulted the girl even after her protest. As she was shouting for help, the three tied her hands, stuffed cloth in her mouth and strangulated her to death. Later, the body was hanged from the ceiling fan with her ‘dupatta’ to show that she had committed suicide.The SDPO said that the accused seemed to have made a fool proof plan to commit the crime. “They also forced the girl to write on a paper that she was committing suicide at her own and nobody should be blamed for the same,” the SDPO said adding that police cracked the case in three days.Gopalganj SP Manoj Tiwari said that while two suspects—Ankit and Niranjan—were sent to jail, the third accused, a minor, was produced before the Juvenile Justice Board, from where he was forwarded to the remand home. “I have asked the investigating officer to list the case for speedy trial,” he told this newspaper over phone.Earlier in the day, a number of students of the school took out a protest march demanding justice for the victim. The school remained closed for the third consecutive days on Thursday. Even teachers have stopped attending classes in the wake of tension prevailing in the village after the incident.The police had earlier lodged a case against unidentified persons on the statement of the deceased’s mother Rima Devi.Principal of the school Shailesh Singh said, “The teachers have been suggested to mark their attendance in the office of the district education officer till the situation turns normal in the village. The teachers are apprehensive of reprisal from close relatives of the girl as well as the residents.”"

NEW DELHI/WASHINGTON: The government rejected the observations on India in the USCIRF annual report, which had accused India of allowing harassment of Muslims and violence against them, saying the US federal government entity’s misrepresentation of India had reached new levels.The report on India was rejected by two of its own commissioners. “Its biased and tendentious comments against India are not new. But on this occasion, its misrepresentation has reached new levels,” MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), which claims to monitor religious freedom around the world, asked the state department to designate 14 nations, including India, as countries of particular concern ( CPC ), alleging that religious minorities were under increasing assault in these nations.However, two of its nine members expressed dissent over USCIRF recommendation to place India in the CPC."

MUMBAI: A special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act court has sentenced a van driver to 10 years’ imprisonment for sexually assaulting a six-year-old girl twice near her Andheri school in 2016. The court observed that the testimony of the victim (now 10) was fluent and without embellishments. The convict, Abdul Rehman, was also fined Rs 15,000. Of this, Rs 10,000 will be given to the girl.On February 11, 2016, the girl was in the school playground when a man dragged her away and sexually assaulted her. On her return home, she looked upset and her mother found stains on her innerwear. On repeated prodding, the girl revealed that an uncle had touched her inappropriately. The man sexually assaulted the girl again the next day. This time, he even threatened to kill her parents. The child went to a teacher and they tried to find the man, in vain.On returning home, the girl confided in her mother, who, along with a neighbour, went to the school. Rehman was standing at the school gate, and the girl identified him. On spotting the girl’s mother making note of his van’s registration number, the driver fled. The girl’s parents then approached the school management and lodged a police complaint a few days later.The convict claimed before the court that he was not present when the alleged incident occurred, but the court observed that he couldn’t produce witnesses to substantiate his claim. The court also observed though there were cameras in the school, the principal said they were of poor quality, and more cameras had been installed only after the incident.A medical officer told the court that no injury was found on the victim’s private parts. At this, judge H C Shende said, “The reason for me to believe the victim’s testimony is the medical officer’s explanation that due to her tender age and the time gap, healing process could be rapid.”“The court took into account there was no reason for a child to falsely accuse a man of sexual assault. Her family wasn’t acquainted with him and she did not commute by his van,” said prosecutor G Malankar. “The victim and her family had to move out of Mumbai because of the trauma.”Rehman’s counsel sought leniency as he had three dependents. “The victim was only six years old. What was her fault?” judge Shende said."

KOLKATA: A 32-year-old director of a gold jewellery chain has been arrested for allegedly driving his Mercedes E-class in a drunken state and assaulting a cop in Salt Lake when he was asked to undertake a breathalyser test The accused, Ayush Soni, a resident of BD Block in Salt Lake, has been charged under several IPC sections. He was produced in a Salt Lake court on Monday, from where he was released on interim bail. However, he will need to appear before the court again on December 9.Around 10pm on Sunday, Soni was sitting in his car at a no-parking zone outside City Centre mall when officers from Bidhannagar North police station, who were carrying out a drive against drink-driving, spotted him. A constable went up to him and asked him to drive out of the no-parking area.“However, Soni got involved in an argument with the constable. The policemen could smell alcohol and as he was sitting at the wheel, asked him to take the breathalyser test. But Soni got agitated and assaulted the constable. Our officers immediately arrested him,” said a senior officer of the commissionerate. Soni’s licence was seized and he had to spend the night at the lock-up of Bidhannagar North police station. The car was seized.“We appealed to the additional chief judicial magistrate’s court to grant him bail, as this was his first offence and he has no past criminal record. The judge considered our case and granted him interim bail,” said Avishek Mukherjee, Soni’s counsel.Following a series of late-night accidents, mostly because of rash- and drink-driving, Bidhannagar commissionerate has been undertaking a drive against drink-driving on a regular basis over the past one and a half months.“The idea is to deter motorists from driving under the influence of alcohol. We have strict instructions to book offenders and seize their licence the moment motorists are caught driving in a drunken state, no matter what his profile is,” said an officer of the commissionerate who has been a part of such drives over the last few weeks."

Trichy: Regional joint director of collegiate education (RJDCE), Trichy, S Usha, who was accused of physically assaulting subordinate staff two weeks ago, has been posted as the RJDCE of Thanjavur.Higher education secretary Apoorva passed an order to this effect on Tuesday. T Arivudainambi, RJDCE of Thanjavur has been appointed as the new Trichy RJDCE.The decision from the higher education department has come under criticism from teachers’ organisations who charged the department of ignoring the safety of its staff at workplace.On February 13, all the 20 staff at the RJDCE office, Trichy staged a protest alleging that Usha had physically assaulted stenographer Rajeswari and office superintendent Savariyammal Brisca Mary.Rajeswari, who was allegedly slapped by Usha, was so traumatized that she had to be admitted to a hospital for treatment.The staff members wrote to the higher education secretary, director of collegiate education and the higher education minister about the incident seeking an inquiry. They also met governor Banwarilal Purohit and submitted a memorandum seeking an inquiry into the incident.Usha went on forced leave the very next day, and two weeks later she has been transferred to Thanjavur, her home town.Stating that the decision from the higher education department will set a bad precedence, general secretary of Aided College Teachers Association (ACTA) S Sahaya Sathish said Usha has been demanding a transfer to Thanjavur.Now, she has been given transfer following the incident, which can only be construed as a reward for her act. There has not been any inquiry into the complaint lodged by the victims, he said.AUT general secretary M S Balamurugan said that the transfer cannot be considered as punishment, as this is not the first such case against her.Earlier, there were complaints of verbal abuse by her on staff.However, no action was taken against her then and she was reinstated to the same post two weeks later."

MADURAI: Madras high court has set aside the conviction and sentence imposed on a man who assaulted a police constable in Madurai in 1997, saying the trial court had not examined important witnesses.The prosecution case is that constable Rathinamani of Teppakulam police received a phone call informing him that a person was being assaulted by seven others at Kuruvikaran Salai on March 28, 1997. When Rathinamani and an SI were searching for the accused in the southern and northern banks of Vaigai river, one of the accused, appellant Sikkandar, assaulted him using a sickle in which he sustained injuries.Following the incident, the police registered a case against Sikkandar and he was arrested. The fast track court in Madurai convicted and sentenced him to undergo three years imprisonment under section 332 (voluntarily causes hurt to any person being a public servant in the discharge of his duty as such public servant) of IPC on June 30, 2009. Sikkandar moved HC Madurai bench the same year challenging the order.On perusal of the submissions, Justice B Pugalendhi observed that the police constable was assaulted by a rowdy element and the complainant is the same police constable. “Even though the investigation was conducted in such a shabby manner, the trial was concluded even without examining the relevant witnesses for arrest and recovery as well as the doctor who provided treatment to the constable,” he said.Though an SI accompanied the constable at the time of occurrence, the person was also not examined. Hence the judge noted that it was not safe to sustain the conviction and sentence and acquitted the appellant of the charges framed against him."

Kolkata: The reverberations of the slap that landed on a doctor’s face reached far beyond CMRI hospital where the incident occurred on Thursday morning with senior doctors practising in government and private hospitals expressing fears that the consequence of the brazen attack shown on television could trigger more such attacks in future.“This is a dark day. Such assault on doctors could be as infectious as the coronavirus. Today, it has happened at CMRI. Tomorrow, it will happen in other hospitals. Every death is unfortunate. But how can a doctor be assaulted every time there is a death? If things go like this, doctors will be scared to operate on patients,” said SSKM Hospital hepatology head Abhijit Chowdhury, who termed the slapping incident a criminal offence.Some doctors said patient Rinki Bhattacharya could have developed pulmonary embolism after childbirth. In such a case, blood clot forms inside a vein and travel to the lung, causing cardiac arrest with high mortality rate. Others, though, felt only a post-mortem could determine the exact cause, something that Basab Mukherjee had himself suggested.“Even doctors with superb clinical skills can make mistakes. Mukherjee rightly suggested a post-mortem to determine the cause of death. The assault was absolutely uncalled for,” said gynaecologist Dibyendu Banerjee, president of Bengal Obstetrics and Gynaecological Society (BOGS).Members of BOGS that has demanded stringent action against the culprit while urging the authorities concerned to carry out a thorough investigation into the cause of the patient’s death, expressed shock that Mukherjee, known for his soft-skills, deep knowledge and polite behaviour, was at the receiving end of the assault.Condemning the incident, doctors said the authorities needed to act tough against the perpetrators to send a clear message that violence would not be tolerated in hospitals. “The slap on the face of this doctor is a slap on the face of the medical community. Sadly, cops were present during the assault. They remained spectators. People who saw the CCTV footage of the assault in front of uniformed men will believe they can get away with anything,” said ENT specialist Arjun Dasgupta of West Bengal Doctors’ Forum (WBDF).Doctors’ bodies cutting across political lines have threatened a stir if the administration did not punish the attacker. Associations like WBDF and Service Doctors’ Forum said they would wait for the police response before deciding on their next course of action. Doctors for Patients (DOPA) has asked the medical fraternity to brace up for protests.Thursday’s incident ended an eight-month lull that had followed a series of attacks on doctors and hospital vandalism. The government had last June adopted a slew of measures to prevent such assaults, mainly in government hospitals after the NRS Hospital incident in which junior doctors were assaulted by a mob.“We will not take this incident lightly and request our members and doctors of all other organisations to prepare for an agitation,” said a DOPA release."

NEW DELHI/WASHINGTON: The government rejected the observations on India in the USCIRF annual report, which had accused India of allowing harassment of Muslims and violence against them, saying the US federal government entity’s misrepresentation of India had reached new levels.The report on India was rejected by two of its own commissioners. “Its biased and tendentious comments against India are not new. But on this occasion, its misrepresentation has reached new levels,” MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), which claims to monitor religious freedom around the world, asked the state department to designate 14 nations, including India, as countries of particular concern ( CPC ), alleging that religious minorities were under increasing assault in these nations.However, two of its nine members expressed dissent over USCIRF recommendation to place India in the CPC."

MADURAI: Stating that bail granted to three accused by a lower court for sexually assaulting and blackmailing a minor girl, is wholly unsustainable, the Madras high court has set aside the order and cancelled the bail.The 14-year-old minor girl was sexually assaulted by a person Visva who took a photograph of her in Sivaganga district in 2019. Three other people - Kaviarasan, Akash and Arunkumar sexually assaulted the girl by blackmailing her using the photograph. The girl’s mother came to know about this incident, when her pictures were circulated on social media by the accused. With the help of Child Line, a complaint was lodged and the police registered a case against the four under several IPC sections 6, 12, 14(1) of POCSO Act and under sections of Information Technology Act and arrested them. The Sivaganga fast track mahila court granted bail to Kaviarasan, Akash and Arunkumar on the ground that the investigation had reached a substantial stage and therefore, it would not prejudice the investigation. The lower court had denied bail to Visva. Hence, the Sivaganga district police moved the high court Madurai bench, seeking to cancel the bail granted to Kaviarasan, Akash and Arunkumar. Hearing the plea, the court observed that as rightly pointed out by the government advocate A Robinson, all four accused had sexually assaulted the victim girl by blackmailing her, hence, there is no justification in treating these three accused on a different footing as that of Visva.The judge observed, “I am afraid that the lower court had not taken into consideration the fact that the victim is a minor.” He further observed that the victim in this case is a 14-year-old girl and the accused have preyed on her innocence by sexually assaulting her and blackmailing her. The judge noted that the case is a crime against society. The judge cited that the Supreme Court has made a distinction between cancelling the bail granted by the lower court, on the ground that the bail conditions have been breached on one hand and those cases where bail ought not to have been granted on the other hand. “The present case comes under the second category. The reason given by the lower court for granting bail to the accused are wholly unsustainable in law,” observed the judge. Hence, the judge set aside the order of the lower court and cancelled the bail of the three accused. The judge directed police to take immediate custody of the three accused."

NEW DELHI: Congress on Tuesday said the nomination of former Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi to Rajya Sabha constitutes a serious assault on the basic structure of the Constitution, alleging it would add to the perception that judiciary is being influenced by the government.AICC spokesman Abhishek Singhvi said, “Congress finds the nomination of a retired CJI to the RS as one of the most serious, unprecedented and unpardonable assaults on the basic structure of the Constitution, which subsumes independence of judiciary as held by the Supreme Court judgements.”Anand Sharma, deputy leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha, said, “Justice Gogoi's nomination is a reward for compromising the independence of the judiciary and delaying hearing of urgent Constitutional matters to appease the government.”“By his conduct and actions, he eroded people's faith in the justice system. The present judges have a duty to undo the damage and restore the dignity of judiciary and people's trust,” he added.The strong words from Congress came amid widespread criticism of Gogoi’s nomination to the RS by the opposition and former judges.Singhvi said Prime Minister Narendra Modi could have followed the advice of late BJP leader Arun Jaitley who had said that possibility of post-retirement benefits influenced judgements delivered by judges.The spokesman, who is also a supreme court lawyer, said Gogoi’s appointment will compound the perception that “judiciary in recent years has not been able to stand up with its usual vigour and fearlessness against the executive and legislative onslaught”.AICC spokesman Randeep Surjewala quoted former SC judge Madan Lokur to ask, “Has the last bastion fallen?”At the same time, Congress sought to rebuff the “propaganda by BJP” that Congress governments too had nominated former CJIs to the upper House.Singhvi said Justice Ranganath Mishra was appointed to RS six years after his retirement while M Hidayatullah was appointed as chairman of the Rajya Sabha and vice president nine years after his retirement as Chief Justice of India.“The dirty tricks department of the ruling party gives completely inapplicable and misleading examples whose only objective is to mislead you,” he said."

MUMBAI: A 32-year-old female ' beggar ' who was arrested on charges of attacking a woman police constable on the bridge at Dadar railway station in April, has been acquitted after a sessions court observed she was falsely implicated in the case.Constable Maya Mane had claimed the accused, Ayesha Badwala, had attacked her when she reasoned with her not to beg. Badwala's defence said an unknown person pushed Mane on the bridge, but the enraged constable caught hold of the accused and assaulted her. Badwala, a domestic help, was arrested on April 10. However, despite being granted bail, she continued to remain in jail as she failed to furnish the surety of Rs 5,000.She was provided a state-appointed lawyer to defend herself.In the detailed judgment copy acquitting Badwala, the court reasoned that in comparison to Mane, Badwala was slim and feeble. ""It is highly improbable that a feeble lady would retaliate against the mighty police personnel. Considering the physique of the accused, it is sheer impossible for her to touch the informant (Mane), leave apart catching hold of the collar (of Mane) and assaulting (her),"" the court said.Further, the court also said nothing was found on Badwala during her search. ""The alleged incident occurred around 3pm. The accused would have gathered some amount if she was begging. However, nothing was recovered at the instance of the accused which falsifies the prosecution case,"" the court said.It was the prosecution's case that on April 10, Mane was on patrolling duty at Matunga railway station. She and two other police officials found a minor girl wandering alone and took her to Dadar crime branch. It was submitted the incident occurred while Mane was on the public bridge at Dadar. Mane claimed she spotted Badwala begging on the crowded bridge and objected to it when the accused caught her collar and slapped her. She claimed the two other cops came to her rescue and took Badwala to the police station.However, the court said while Mane had claimed the incident took place on the bridge, one of the two cops who was purportedly with her, had told the court the incident occurred on the slope of platforms three and four. ""There is no independent witness to support the prosecution in the light of self-interested version of the informant. In view of aforesaid contradictory evidence, possibility of false implication of accused is eminent. As such accused deserves benefit of doubt,"" the court held. It also noted the investigator did not collect a copy of the movement register or any other document to show why Mane was sent to Dadar railway station."

WASHINGTON: An associate of a former Senate aide to Joe Biden says the woman told her about her allegations of sexual assault against Biden - now the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee in the 1990s.The account, which was published Monday in Business Insider , comes a little over a month after Tara Reade first accused Biden of sexually assaulting her in the basement of a Capitol Hill office building when she worked in his office in the spring of 1993. Biden's campaign has denied the allegations.In an interview with The Associated Press earlier this month, Reade said she had told at least four people about the incident, including her deceased mother and her brother, who has spoken publicly about the matter. The AP spoke with two individuals on the condition of anonymity; one said Reade told them about the alleged assault when it happened, while the other said Reade told them in 2007 or 2008 about experiencing sexual harassment from Biden while working in his Senate office.Now Lynda LaCasse, who was Reade's neighbor in the 1990s, says Reade told her about the alleged assault around the time it happened. LaCasse said that when they were neighbors in 1995 or 1996, Reade told her ``about the senator that she had worked for and he put his hand up her skirt.''``She felt like she was assaulted, and she really didn't feel there was anything she could do,'' LaCasse told Business Insider.A second woman, Lorraine Sanchez, worked with Reade for California state Sen. Jack O'Connell from 1994 to 1996. Sanchez told Business Insider that Reade said ``she had been sexually harassed by her former boss while she was in DC'' and was fired for voicing her concerns.The AP was unable to reach Sanchez or LaCasse. Reade did not respond to questions about why she did not mention the women in earlier interviews as people who could corroborate her story. She told The AP on Monday that she had been asked not to share the women's contact information with news organizations.The Biden campaign declined to comment on the new interviews, pointing to an earlier statement from deputy campaign manager and communications director Kate Bedingfield. The statement said that while sexual assault claims should be ``diligently reviewed by an independent press,'' what Reade alleged ``absolutely did not happen.''Reade said in past interviews that Biden pushed her against a wall in the basement of a Capitol Hill office building, groped her and penetrated her with his fingers. She said after telling her supervisors in Biden's office that she had been sexually harassed by the then-senator, her concerns weren't taken seriously and she was eventually told to find another job.Two of those staffers have said in interviews that they didn't recall Reade or any such incident. The third issued an on-the-record statement denying Reade's claim.Late last week, the Intercept unearthed a 1993 video clip that shows a woman Reade says was her mother calling into CNN's ``Larry King Live.'' In the clip, an unnamed woman from San Luis Obispo, Calif., tells King that her daughter just left Washington , ``after working for a prominent senator, and could not get through with her problems at all, and the only thing she could have done was go to the press, and she chose not to do it out of respect for him.''Last spring, eight women, including Reade, came forward with allegations that Biden made them feel uncomfortable with inappropriate displays of affection. Biden acknowledged the complaints and promised to be ``more mindful about respecting personal space in the future.``The AP spoke with Reade about those complaints in April 2019. During that interview, Reade alleged that Biden rubbed her shoulders and neck and played with her hair, and that she was asked by another aide in Biden's Senate office to dress more conservatively and told ``don't be so sexy.'' The AP declined to publish details of the interview at the time because reporters were unable to corroborate her allegations, and aspects of her story contradicted other reporting.Reade came forward in March with the additional allegation of assault during a podcast interview with Katie Halper The Republican National Committee and other allies of President Donald Trump have been highlighting Reade's allegations against Biden, though the president has not raised them himself. Trump has faced numerous allegations of sexual assault, allegations he denies. He also apologized during the 2016 campaign for comments he made during an interview with Access Hollywood in which he bragged about using his celebrity to assault women.Reade, a longtime Democrat who supported both Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders in the primary, said she won't be voting for Trump or Biden in November. While Trump has faced allegations of sexual assault that are more severe and numerous, Reade said she felt either was a similarly bad option.``It's sad statement about our own culture that we are having to choose between two men that have allegations of sexual assault and sexual harassment and a history of misogyny,'' Reade said."

Nashik: Gangapur police on Sunday arrested two people on charges of assaulting a public servant along with other sections of the Motor Vehicles Act.Both the suspects — Sagar Jadhav (24) and Motiram Shevre (20) — are residents of Cidco area. According to police, at 5pm, the suspect duo arrived at a checkpoint that was being manned by constable Nikhil Salve.“The duo asked the constable to let them pass, but the latter demanded to see a pass issued by the administration. Following this, one of the youths informed the constable that he was a public representative and showed an outdated identity card issued by the state government,” a police officer said.“The constable then grew suspicious and demanded to check the car. This is when the suspects pushed him and tried to flee in the vehicle. In the process, they also knocked down a person at Mahindra Circle and rammed into a government vehicle,” he added.The police finally reached the spot and found 25 cans of beer in the car. They have been arrested under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including section 353 (Assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and under sections of Maharashtra Vehicle Act and Maharashtra Prohibition Act.On Monday, the suspects were produced before a city court that remanded them in three-day police custody."

UDHAGAMANDALAM: A Class 11 student, who was sexually abused by her karate teacher at Gudalur in the Nilgiris, was attacked by a gang of men after her mother lodged a complaint against the perpetrator with police on Sunday.Though the girl’s mother made an oral complaint to police on Saturday and then followed up with a formal written complaint on Monday, the Gudalur police are yet to register an FIR.The injured girl was first taken to the Gudalur government hospital and then referred to Ooty GH. Doctors said she had suffered injuries on the left ear and was being treated as an inpatient.Asked about the police reluctance to register a case, Nilgiris superintendent of police C Kalai Chelvan said they had to make preliminary inquiries.“The complainant approached the Gudalur police station on Saturday and asked police to take action discreetly. We told her that action could not be taken without a written complaint,” said the SP.“There are three theories about the incident. We also wanted to know why the father of the girl was supporting the alleged perpetrators of the sexual and physical assault,” Kalai Chelvan said. He said a sub inspector has been assigned to inquire into the case and a FIR will be registered on Tuesday.“We will register the case on Tuesday and arrest the accused,’’ he said.According to the girl’s mother, the karate teacher from Vimalagiri had been sexually harassing her daughter over the past few days in her school. The woman approached the school authorities with a complaint against the accused. “Since they failed to take action against the karate teacher, I approached police and gave an oral complaint on Sunday,’’ the girl’s mother told TOI. Police told her that action could not be taken unless a formal complaint was lodged.Hours after she approached police, a gang of about seven men barged into her house and picked up a quarrel.“They locked the house from inside to prevent us from escaping. One of the men started beating my daughter on the face and head while another man strangled her,’’ she said in the complaint. Another man picked up a knife from the house and attempted to attack the girl.“When I tried to save my daughter, I was also beaten up,’’ she said. All this, while about 50 men who had accompanied the gang stood outside the house hurling abuses at the two, she said.After the gang left, a neighbour came to their rescue and took the girl to hospital.The Nilgiris police at first said they were not aware of any such incident, but later admitted having received a complaint."

NEW DELHI/WASHINGTON: The government rejected the observations on India in the USCIRF annual report, which had accused India of allowing harassment of Muslims and violence against them, saying the US federal government entity’s misrepresentation of India had reached new levels.The report on India was rejected by two of its own commissioners. “Its biased and tendentious comments against India are not new. But on this occasion, its misrepresentation has reached new levels,” MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), which claims to monitor religious freedom around the world, asked the state department to designate 14 nations, including India, as countries of particular concern ( CPC ), alleging that religious minorities were under increasing assault in these nations.However, two of its nine members expressed dissent over USCIRF recommendation to place India in the CPC."

Toronto: Canada's worst mass shooting erupted from an argument between the gunman and his girlfriend, who survived the attack, police confirmed Friday.Royal Canadian Mounted Police Supt. Darren Campbell said the weekend shooting rampage started with an assault by the suspect on his girlfriend and ended with 22 people dead in communities across central and northern Nova Scotia ""She did manage to escape. That could well have been the catalyst of events,"" Campbell said.Campbell also said they are not discounting that the suspect planned some of the murders.He said the girlfriend hid overnight in the woods from the suspect, who has been identified as 51-year-old Gabriel Wortman.Police have said Wortman acted alone in the shooting spree that killed 22 people in several rural communities.Campbell said they found 13 deceased victims in the rural community of Portapique, where the suspect lived part time.He said when police arrived, they discovered a man shot. The man reported he was driving when someone in what looked like a police car shot him. He survived and was transported to hospital.They were several homes on fire, including the suspect's, when police arrived in the community. Campbell said the suspect had a pistol and several long barreled guns. They found several dead in and outside homes.Campbell said at about 6:30 a.m., Wortman's girlfriend emerged from hiding in the woods, called 911 and gave police detailed information about the suspect including that he was driving a mock police car and was in police uniform.More than an hour later, police started receiving 911 calls more than 35 miles away. Campbell said the suspect killed three people he knew and set the house on fire.He also shot a woman on the street and pulled cars over and shot and killed people, Campbell said. He later shot and injured a male police officer in his car.The officer managed to escape and survived. Campbell then said there was a collision between a female officer's police car and the gunman's mock police car.He shot and killed the officer. Campbell said he then killed a witness who arrived on the scene.He then drove to a house and killed a woman he knew before removing his police uniform and stealing her car. He then drove to get gas and was shot by a police officer who happened to be at the gas station refueling.The suspect was shot to death at 11:26 on Sunday morning, about 13 hours after the attacks began.Police have said Wortman carried out much of the attack disguised as a police officer in a vehicle marked to seem like a patrol car.Campbell said he had a few cars that police believe were former police vehicles. His home was destroyed by fire.John Hudson, who had known Wortman for about 18 years, said Wortman was sometimes openly controlling and jealous of his long-time girlfriend.“I didn't see him hitting her or anything like that,” Hudson said.“But I know they fought.” Hudson recalled a bonfire party about 10 years ago when an argument between the two left the woman locked out of their home in rural Portapique.“I was with her, trying to get her stuff out of there,” Hudson said.“People had been drinking ... and it was a crazy night ... and he didn't want her to leave, but he wouldn't let her in the house.”Wortman, who owned a denture practice in the city of Dartmouth, near Halifax, lived part time in Portapique, according to residents. His Atlantic Denture Clinic had been closed the past month because of the coronavirus pandemic.Mass shootings are relatively rare in Canada.The country overhauled its gun control laws after Marc Lepine shot 14 women and himself to death at Montreal 's Ecole Polytechnique college in 1989.Before the weekend rampage, that had been Canada's worst mass shooting.Two years ago Thursday, a man drove a van along a busy Toronto sidewalk and killed 10 people and injured 16.The suspect, who is awaiting trial, said he carried out the attack in retribution for years of sexual rejection and ridicule by women."

MUMBAI: An RTI activist has lodged a complaint with Mumbai police commissioner seeking immediate registration of an FIR against DCP Abhinash Kumar for allegedly assaulting him without provocation.Mumbai-based RTI activist Yashwant Shinde was admitted to KEM Hospital six days ago for internal injuries. He was discharged three days later on December 30. Shinde has given a two-day deadline for registration of his FIR or he would approach the Maharashtra State Police Complaint Authority.Shinde had filed an appeal with Kumar regarding an “unsatisfactory” reply he got from Worli and Byculla police over Right to Information (RTI) Act queries. In December, Shinde had sought details under RTI on Worli police’s seizure of Rs 4 crore cash from a car during the state assembly elections in October.“I had sought information regarding the seizure of cash as well as a job racket registered at Agripada police where BMC jobs were given on the basis of fake documents. In both cases, Mumbai police gave me evasive replies. Hence, I filed an appeal before DCP Kumar who was to hear me on December 27,” said Shinde.Shinde had taken along a friend, Jitendra Kataria, to Kumar’s office.Shinde alleged Kumar was aggressive and within minutes the discussion turned ugly. “I was polite to him and was listening sincerely but Kumar was rude and aggressive. All of a sudden, he got furious and jumped on his table and then pounced on me and began to hit me ruthlessly.” Shinde said when he tried to run, Kumar called his colleagues who pulled him back in the cabin. “They caught me and helped Kumar beat me till I fell unconscious.”A bleeding Shinde was handed over to Byculla police where cops allegedly told him there was no point in complaining against Kumar, while apologising on his behalf, and advised him to say he fell off a chair. “A few policemen visited me in hospital and tried to convince me to change my mind about filing a complaint.”Denying the allegation, Kumar said, “Nothing of this sort happened. He got injured after falling off a chair. The complaint is an afterthought as he is in the habit of being rude and of misbehaving. Four diary entries have been made against him for misbehaving with senior policemen. Secondly, the information he had sought under RTI was not relevant to him.”"

AJMER: A woman doctor filed a complaint at Civil Lines police station here on Thursday accusing a woman IAS officer posted as SDM, of assaulting and threatening her. The SDM however refuted the charges. Police have initiated investigation before registering an FIR in the matter.Medical officer Jyotsana Ranga has stated in her complaint that recently, at the CMHO office, there was a meeting addressed by SDM Artika Shukla. Shukla allegedly spoke against some resident doctors and others, while Dr Ranga was sitting with her mobile in her hand. Shukla thought that Ranga was shooting a video or recording something on the phone.Shukla then allegedly misbehaved with and manhandled Ranga, trying to snatch her mobile. Dr Ranga has also alleged that when a large number of positive cases emerged in Mochi Mohalla, she asked that all suspects be sent to quarantine centre, but nodal officer SDM Shukla directed to home quarantine them instead.Shukla however maintained that all allegations made against her are baseless. “At a time when 44 corona cases have been reported from Ajmer , it is extremely unfortunate that she is spreading baseless rumours, rather than working for the patients. No one manhandled her and no one said anything to her,” said Shukla. She said that the doctor was misbehaving hence was asked to leave. “As Covid in-charge of Ajmer, I had gone to the CMHO to plan contact tracing of patients and will continue to do so in future,” she said."

Ramesh, who knew that the brothers Dilip and Suresh often passed time with Bhikha also warned him about them and said they should stop meeting to reduce risks of infection.Bhikha then phoned Suresh and Dilip and told them to stop meeting him for some time, but instead of cooperation they began abusing him on phone.On Saturday morning, the two brothers came to Bhikha’s house and began hurling abuses. When Bhikha went out to talk with them, they got into an altercation and asked him why he had insulted them by refusing them entry to his home. They then began beating him.Later, Dilip came with a spade and tried to injure Bhikha’s feet with it. When Bhikha began screaming for help, his family members rushed out and rescued him. Bhikha was taken to a nearby hospital where he gave his statement against the duo.Later, Mansa police registered a complaint of assault, criminal intimidation and abetment against the two men."

NEW DELHI: A security guard of a playschool near Pitampura was arrested for sexually assaulting a two-and-a-half-year-old child. The girl’s family also alleged that the school authorities ignored their complaint.The incident occurred on October 5, after which the school was closed for vacations. On returning home, the child complained to her mother about pain in her private parts. Earlier this week, when the mother tried to send the child to school, she refused and started crying.Initially, the parents presumed that the child was unwilling to go to school since she was unfamiliar with the surroundings as she had been admitted there on August 2. However, when they talked to her, she revealed that the security guard posted at the gate had touched her private parts.The parents then lodged a complaint at Maurya Enclave police station. The child was taken for medical examination and counselled. A statement of the child and her parents was taken under CrPC Section 164 after which a magistrate ordered police to arrest the security guard from his house near the school.During interrogation, the security guard admitted to the crime."

MUMBAI: The maximum sentence businessmen Surinder (69) and Sanjay Ruia (68) faced, in a long-standing dispute with their nephew Gajanan over Ruia House, was seven years. Considering their age some leniency could be shown, said the court. It convicted them under IPC sections 452 (house trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint) and 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons).“The sentence will also extend satisfaction to the victims of crime that law has prevailed,” the judge said.“The mala fide practice of engaging goons to resolve a property dispute by force or terror appears to be alive through the conduct of the accused persons,” the court said.Gajanan, who had registered a case with D N Nagar police on April 25, 1997, submitted that the families had cases pending in court. He said Surinder and Sanjay were his “cousin uncles” and occupied one portion of the bungalow, while he lived in another portion with his father, brother and their families. Gajanan alleged that since April 2, 1997, the accused had hired and kept about 50 security personnel around the house. His brother claimed that he had seen Capt Swaran Salaria, also a BJP politician, enter the house with a gun on April 3, 1997.Gajanan said while having dinner around 9.15pm on April 24, 1997, he heard some sounds. On checking, he and his brother reportedly found that Salaria and around 20 security guards were smashing the hall’s doors. He alleged that Sanjay and Surendra were also present.Gajanan said on spotting him, Salaria and his men began assaulting him with their fists and a baton at the behest of his uncles. He said the accused then entered his house via his office and assaulted his brother.Gajanan said when he freed himself, the accused pushed him and left, but not before breaking chairs and tables in his office.He alleged that Sanjay had threatened him, saying it was the “first lesson”.After the gang left, Gajanan approached police, who took him to hospital.On September 13, 2002, police submitted the chargesheet. Three years later, on August 22, 2005, the court framed charges against the accused, but they pleaded not guilty. While Surinder and Sanjay claimed that a false case had been filed to harass them and their families, Salaria submitted that he had been falsely implicated to damage his reputation and future. Seven witnesses, including Gajanan, his brother, police, a panch witness and a doctor who treated the victims for injuries, deposed.Refuting the defence submissions, the court held that there was no reason for an independent witnesses-panch, police and doctor to depose falsely against the accused after two decades of the incident.“Ultimately, evidence of all witnesses with prompt lodging of FIR and medical examination of the injured furnishes an assurance about the occurrence of the incident. There appears no justified reason to disbelieve or reject their versions,” the court said."

Soon after the local cops started a search, the girl returned home crying.After being counselled, the child said that while she was going to the shop, a youth riding a black motorcycle said that her mother was looking for her. He offered to drop her home, but instead took her to an empty plot in the area and sexually assaulted her. When she started crying, Kumar panicked and left her near a private hospital and fled. The survivor said that she walked back home from there.A case under Indian Penal Code Section 363 (kidnapping) and under sections of POCSO Act was subsequently registered at Najafgarh police station.Police started chalking out the route taken by the accused, later identified as Pawan Kumar, by analysing footage of CCTV cameras in the area.

The motorcycle was also seized.During interrogation, Kumar confessed to having molested the child. He also revealed that he had assaulted two other minor girls in the past two weeks.

But on this occasion, its misrepresentation has reached new levels,” MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), which claims to monitor religious freedom around the world, asked the state department to designate 14 nations, including India, as countries of particular concern ( CPC ), alleging that religious minorities were under increasing assault in these nations.However, two of its nine members expressed dissent over USCIRF recommendation to place India in the CPC."

FRESH TRIAL

Court: Child victim’s testimony not enough

NEW DELHI: A youth who had been languishing in jail for three years on the charge of sexually assaulting a boy in 2016 is now set to walk free.On a retrial, a city court has found him innocent, noting there is a ""high possibility"" that the crime scene was compromised.“It prima facie appears incriminating material, such as hair and a blanket, were planted (by the boy’s mother),” observed additional sessions judge Ajay Pandey, while accepting the man’s claim that false evidence were planted against him. The court also agreed with the man’s submission that the child’s testimony showed he had been tutored by his parents. The man, currently in his early 20s, was convicted on March 27, 2018, of sexually assaulting the boy — now eight years old — and sentenced to 10 years in jail on April 2, 2018.After being sentenced, the man moved the Delhi high court, which observed a clear failure of justice had occurred owing to sheer ineffective cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses. The high court said the trial court had erred in not resolving the situation at an appropriate stage by appointing another defence counsel.On May 10, 2019, the conviction order was set aside and the high court ordered a retrial. It said a proper opportunity should be given to the accused’s lawyer to cross-examine the prosecution witnesses afresh. The prosecution could also seek to re-examine any witness in accordance with law, it added.The boy’s mother had lodged a complaint against the man alleging that on January 29, 2016, her minor son confided in her at 1pm that their neighbour had called him to his room and sexually assaulted him. He also reportedly threatened the boy, who was in pain due to resultant injuries, she had claimed. The man was then arrested and chargesheeted for penetrative sexual assault on a child below 12 years and aggravated penetrative sexual assault under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (Pocso), 2012, and unnatural sex and criminal intimidation under IPC.Claiming he was innocent, the accused, represented by amicus curiae Adit S Pujari in the fresh trial, said the allegation was the result of a quarrel between him and the boy’s father. Public prosecutor Pankaj Ranga, however, argued the child, though only five years old, had remained consistent with his testimony.But the court doubted the credibility of the evidence collected from the crime scene. It noted that the hair strands of the boy were collected from a blanket lying on the bed on which he was allegedly assaulted but there was no sign of a scuffle. The accused was living with his aunt and her family but nobody else’s hair was found on the blanket, it added.Relying on forensic examination, the court also rejected the theory of detection of blood on the survivor’s clothes. The court agreed with Pujari’s submission that the child’s testimony showed tutoring by his parents. Though the child had disclosed about the quarrel, he denied it during his crossexamination in the retrial.“This court is of the opinion that the uncorroborated testimony of child victim is not safe to write conviction of accused in the present case (sic),” the judge said.(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)"

KOLKATA: The reverberations of the slap that landed on a doctor’s face reached far beyond CMRI hospital where the incident occurred on Thursday morning with senior doctors practising in government and private hospitals expressing fears that the consequence of the brazen attack shown on television could trigger more such attacks in future.“This is a dark day. Such assault on doctors could be as infectious as the coronavirus. Today, it has happened at CMRI. Tomorrow, it will happen in other hospitals. Every death is unfortunate. But how can a doctor be assaulted every time there is a death? If things go like this, doctors will be scared to operate on patients,” said SSKM Hospital hepatology head Abhijit Chowdhury, who termed the slapping incident a criminal offence.Some doctors said patient Rinki Bhattacharya could have developed pulmonary embolism after childbirth. In such a case, blood clot forms inside a vein and travel to the lung, causing cardiac arrest with high mortality rate. Others, though, felt only a post-mortem could determine the exact cause, something that Basab Mukherjee had himself suggested.“Even doctors with superb clinical skills can make mistakes. Mukherjee rightly suggested a post-mortem to determine the cause of death. The assault was absolutely uncalled for,” said gynaecologist Dibyendu Banerjee, president of Bengal Obstetrics and Gynaecological Society (BOGS).Members of BOGS that has demanded stringent action against the culprit while urging the authorities concerned to carry out a thorough investigation into the cause of the patient’s death, expressed shock that Mukherjee, known for his soft-skills, deep knowledge and polite behaviour, was at the receiving end of the assault.Condemning the incident, doctors said the authorities needed to act tough against the perpetrators to send a clear message that violence would not be tolerated in hospitals. “The slap on the face of this doctor is a slap on the face of the medical community. Sadly, cops were present during the assault. They remained spectators. People who saw the CCTV footage of the assault in front of uniformed men will believe they can get away with anything,” said ENT specialist Arjun Dasgupta of West Bengal Doctors’ Forum (WBDF).Doctors’ bodies cutting across political lines have threatened a stir if the administration did not punish the attacker. Associations like WBDF and Service Doctors’ Forum said they would wait for the police response before deciding on their next course of action. Doctors for Patients (DOPA) has asked the medical fraternity to brace up for protests.Thursday’s incident ended an eight-month lull that had followed a series of attacks on doctors and hospital vandalism. The government had last June adopted a slew of measures to prevent such assaults, mainly in government hospitals after the NRS Hospital incident in which junior doctors were assaulted by a mob.“We will not take this incident lightly and request our members and doctors of all other organisations to prepare for an agitation,” said a DOPA release."

AHMEDABAD: The new Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Hospital has made the news again, this time as security staff allegedly assaulted a woman and her son, who had come to the hospital for a heart.The AMC, however, claimed that the mother and son had attacked staffers and security personnel who intervened. AMC officials said the matter reached the police station, but a ‘compromise’ was worked out there.Jayshree Dave said, “On Wednesday, my son Sunny and I had gone to SVP Hospital to get his reports. After reaching the designated window, they were told to wait. We decided to go and consult the doctors in the meantime. After an hour when we returned, the staff again told us to wait.”Dave further said when the wait grew too long, her son took out his mobile phone and started making a video. “He stated the fact that we were made to wait for more than two hours just to pick up a report. The hospital staffers then call the security guards, who arrived and started hitting him. When I intervened, the women security staffers started beating me,” said Dave.She said that the security staffers took her son outside and when she got there, she found that they were beating him. “I immediately dialled 100 and the police reached the spot,” Dave said.She said the hospital agreed to apologize in writing after which they did not file a complaint. Meanwhile, a statement from the hospital stated that the son was suffering from major adjustment disorder with depression and when they were told to wait for the MRI report, the mother and son attacked staffers. “They even attacked the security staff who intervened,” the statement said."

KUALA LUMPUR: Two US warships are operating in the South China Sea , the Navy said on Tuesday, with three regional security sources saying they were near an area of a standoff between China and Malaysia.The Haiyang Dizhi 8, a Chinese government research ship, was spotted last week conducting a survey close to an exploration vessel operated by Malaysia’s state oil company Petronas, months after it undertook a similar patrol off Vietnam.The incident prompted the United States to call on China to stop its “bullying behaviour” in the disputed waters, citing concern over Beijing's provocative actions towards offshore oil and gas developments there.The US State Department has said China was taking advantage of the region's focus on the coronavirus pandemic to ""coerce its neighbours"".The USS America amphibious assault ship and the USS Bunker Hill , a guided missile cruiser, have been deployed and were operating in the South China Sea, US Indo-Pacific Command spokeswoman Nicole Schwegman said on Tuesday.""Through our continued operational presence in the South China Sea, we are working ... to promote freedom of navigation and overflight, and the international principles that underpin security and prosperity for the Indo-Pacific,"" Schwegman said in an emailed statement to Reuters.""The US supports the efforts of our allies and partners to determine their own economic interests.""Rear Admiral Fred Kacher, commander of the USS America Expeditionary Strike Group, told Reuters that his forces had interacted with Chinese naval forces in the South China Sea this week.""All our interactions continue to be safe and professional with them,"" Kacher said in a telephone interview from the USS America.Schwegman did not state the exact location of the warships but security sources said they were close to the Haiyang Dizhi 8 and the Petronas-operated West Capella drillship. The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media.The area is near waters claimed by both Vietnam and Malaysia as well by China, through its sweeping claim to most of the South China Sea within its U-shaped 'nine-dash line' that is not recognised by its neighbours or most of the world.China has denied reports of a stand-off, saying that the Haiyang Dizhi 8 was conducting normal activities.""The ‘confrontation’ at sea you mention did not happen,"" the foreign ministry said in a faxed response to Reuters' questions on Monday.Petronas and Malaysia's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The Chinese survey vessel's moves this month come as Beijing ramps up coronavirus diplomacy, donating large supplies of medical equipment and aid to Southeast Asian countries.A team of Chinese medical experts arrived this week in Malaysia, which has reported more than 5,400 coronavirus infections.The United States has accused China of taking advantage of the distraction of the pandemic to advance its presence in the South China Sea.On Sunday, Vietnam protested after China said it had established two administrative districts on the Paracel and Spratly islands in the disputed waters."

LUCKNOW: A 28-year-old law student of a private college lodged an FIR at Chinhat police station on Friday against a male classmate and his aides of assaulting her and trying to outrage her modesty after she lodged a complaint of harassment of girls by boys with the college administration and raised the issue on social media.The woman said that male students in the college often misbehave and harass girls. She had reported this to senior college officers several times but to no avail.""Encouraged by inaction, they started harassing and abusing me publicly. However, I raised the issue through posts on Facebook ,"" she said.""On Friday, a few officers in college pulled me up for the posts and some male students attacked me and damaged my scooter. I called police but by that time, the rowdy mob had fled,"" she said in the FIR.Chinhat SHO Sachin Singh said, ""We have called the accused and complainant to record their statements on Saturday."""
505,Assault,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/pti-sports-feed/stokes-assault-as-england-dominate/articleshow/73122667.cms,"Cape Town, Jan 6 (AFP) Ben Stokes launched an astonishing assault on the South African bowlers as England took full command on the fourth day of the second Test against South Africa at Newlands on Monday.

England were 375 for seven in their second innings at lunch, an overall lead of 421 runs. They added 157 runs for the loss of three wickets in 27 overs during the morning.

Stokes slammed 72 off 47 balls to overshadow a maiden Test century by Dom Sibley, who continued his sedate progress as he took his overnight score of 85 to 125 not out. He reached his hundred off 269 balls and faced another 30 deliveries before lunch.

Stokes attacked all the bowlers he faced and hit seven fours and three sixes before being caught at long-on off left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj.

Ollie Pope fell quickly but Jos Buttler continued the attack, hitting 23 off 18 balls as the lead went beyond 400.

South African captain Faf du Plessis chose not to take the second new ball when it was due after a maiden over by Pretorius at the start of play. He perhaps reasoned that Maharaj had a chance of dismissing Stokes early in his innings.

The tactic backfired, however, as 28 runs were added in five overs before the new ball was taken, including sixes by Stokes off Pretorius and Maharaj.

Stokes played an attacking shot off almost every ball he faced and was undeterred by a let-off on 38 when he top-edged a pull against Kagiso Rabada and wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock ran about 35m but dropped the ball as he dived for it. AFP SSC SSC"

KOLKATA: Jadavpur University descended into chaos on Thursday after a section of students, belonging to some ultra-left unions, assaulted Union minister and BJP Asansol MP Babul Supriyo , who had gone to the campus to attend a programme organised by Bharatiya Janata Party student wing Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad.But the violent left-versus-right students’-union face-off on a varsity campus seemed headed for wider political ramifications after conversations between the state’s chief minister, its governor (also the university’s chancellor) and the university’s vice-chancellor indicated sharp differences on how to fight the latest crisis gripping one of Bengal’s premier educational institutions. Seniors in the Trinamool government called Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar’s decision — to drive down to JU hours after news of the violence broke — “a move without precedence in recent times”.Trinamool leaders present in Delhi along with CM Mamata Banerjee said she got a call from governor Dhankhar around 6.20pm, which she missed. But she then called back the governor and, after coming to know that he was headed for the JU campus, requested him not to go there because it was a students’ agitation to protest against a “Union minister attending an ABVP party function”.The Trinamool later issued a media statement, saying it was “most unfortunate and shocking” that the “hon’ble governor went there without taking the state government into confidence”. “He rang up the CM on his way. The CM requested him several times that the governor, being the constitutional head, did not need to go there at that moment. The CM requested him to give the state government some time to peacefully resolve the issue,” the statement said, adding: “But, instead of taking the government into confidence, the governor went there to help the BJP.”There was no response to the Trinamool statements from Raj Bhavan till late on Thursday night but a statement issued by the governor’s office earlier in the evening expressed concern at the “unlawful detention of a union minister” and termed the events on the JU campus “a very serious reflection on the law-and-order (situation) of the state and the conduct of law-enforcing agencies”.There were indications from the university that JU vice-chancellor Suranjan Das was “under pressure to resign” after the incident. “There were serious differences of opinion between the chancellor of the university (governor Dhankhar) and the V-C about calling in cops to tackle the situation and V-C Das, at one point of time, said he would rather resign than call in cops,” a senior state government minister told TOI. “But we have impressed on him that his first task is to restore normalcy to the campus,” the minister said, adding: “There is no need for the V-C to resign.”State education minister Partha Chatterjee, officials said, was in constant touch with Das, who was admitted to a hospital on Thursday evening with complaints of “headache, vertigo, palpitation and nausea”.Dhankhar was caught up in the protests at the university for nearly an hour, first because of the students’ agitation on the campus and then because of the violent protests by ABVP members outside. Police finally managed to escort the governor out around 8pm, after which the Rapid Action Force was deployed to control the situation. The governor later called Union home minister Amit Shah and briefed him on the situation.Thursday’s fiasco followed strident protests on the campus over the years, including display of black flags and “go-back” chants against former chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and serving education minister Chatterjee. Bengal CM Banerjee, too, has been at the receiving end of ugly protests at Presidency University that forced authorities to hold the convocation elsewhere this January.The first sign of trouble on Thursday came around 2.30 p.m. when Babul stepped on the campus to attend a freshers’ welcome organised by the ABVP. The ultra-left Democratic Students’ Federation and the Forum for Arts Students waved black flags, screamed “go-back” slogans and blocked his path to the KP Basu Memorial Hall. Students’ Federation of India representatives said they backed the students’ demands but did not support the gherao.V-C Das offered to escort Babul to his office but the latter refused and insisted on attending the programme. The union minister suggested that the VC could have controlled the situation had he arrived earlier and called in the police, witnesses said, but Das told him he would rather resign than call cops on the campus. Once inside, Babul expressed apprehension over how he would return once the programme ended.His apprehensions proved true as students stepped up the agitation when he tried to leave around 5 p.m. They gharoed Babul and began jostling with him, causing him to fall on the ground. Some students pulled him by his hair and a security personnel’s magazine fell from the rifle in the melee.“The protesters were trying to disturb peace by instigating students and seminar organisers to create a stampede-like situation. I did not come here to do politics. But I am saddened by the behaviour of some of the university students and the way they have heckled me. They pulled my hair and pushed me. The VC was also manhandled by the students. The incident is absolutely deplorable,” Babul told mediapersons."

KOLKATA: Incidents of misconduct by app-cab drivers, like the one that took place near Park Circus on Wednesday where a woman was allegedly abused, assaulted and shoved out of the vehicle, show that stringent measures taken by online cab aggregators are falling short of ensuring passenger safety.“A driver’s unsafe behaviour, particularly towards women and elderly citizens, bothers us the most. This is why we are getting more and more stringent with time. A driver gets on board only after a series of checks and due diligence. Gender sensitization has become a round-the-year activity for us. Such misconducts are a miniscule percentage compared to our scale of operation, but it worries us the most,” said an Uber official.The real-time ID-checking is a feature where a driver is periodically prompted by the system to share selfie with the online aggregator of cab services. This ensures that the driver behind the wheels matches the aggregator’s records. The system almost eliminates the scope of identity swapping. In some cases, the actions were on a real-time basis, explained an Ola official.Ujjaini Bose, a regular app-cab user, for instance, once noticed the driver constantly checking his rear view mirror. At first, she thought he was being cautious with his driving, but then she discovered he was trying to click pictures of her. “I was angry. When I asked him what he was doing, he replied that he was checking his eyes. I deleted the photos from his phone and got off the cab. I lodged a complaint against him in the app and he was not allowed to drive anymore,” said Bose.Drivers’ rating can some time be deceptive. Sreyoshi Roy Chowdhury, 26, was returning home recently when she had an unpleasant experience with a driver with highest possible rating. “I was returning home in an Uber late in the evening when I heard the driver talk to someone on the phone using abusive sexual language. It made me feel incredibly uncomfortable and unsafe. Fearing for my safety, I called a trusted family member and stayed with them on the phone until I reached my destination, constantly informing them about my whereabouts,” said Sreyoshi."

HYDERABAD: A female artiste, who last year participated in a popular reality show, lodged a complaint against former Patancheru MLA Nandeswar Goud’s son Ashish Goud accusing him of misbehaving with her in a pub at a popular star hotel in Madhapur.Madhapur police said that the 27-year-old woman alleged that when she and her friends were inside the pub, Ashish allegedly held her hand and passed vulgar comments at them.""A person by name Ashish Goud and his two friends misbehaved with me and my friends by catching hands, shouted on us with vulgar language. Ashish and his friends threw bottles on the floor and about to hit us,"" she alleged.Deputy Commissioner of Police (Madhapur Zone) A Venkateshwar Rao told TOI that a case was registered and the artiste approached the police seeking action.A case was registered under sections 354 (Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 509 (Whoever, intending to insult the modesty of any woman) of IPC and the investigation is being done. Police said that they are verifying the CCTVs, which are in the pub to ascertain the fact.While denying the allegations, Ashish told mediapersons that the case was registered as part of a conspiracy by his opponent political parties.""The allegations are false. I ask the opposition parties to directly take on me in the election rather than filing a false case,"" he said."

NEW DELHI/WASHINGTON: The government rejected the observations on India in the USCIRF annual report, which had accused India of allowing harassment of Muslims and violence against them, saying the US federal government entity’s misrepresentation of India had reached new levels.The report on India was rejected by two of its own commissioners. “Its biased and tendentious comments against India are not new. But on this occasion, its misrepresentation has reached new levels,” MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), which claims to monitor religious freedom around the world, asked the state department to designate 14 nations, including India, as countries of particular concern ( CPC ), alleging that religious minorities were under increasing assault in these nations.However, two of its nine members expressed dissent over USCIRF recommendation to place India in the CPC."

My friend Joydeep and I were chatting and smoking when a middle-aged man came up to us and began abusing me for smoking in public. When I reacted to his comments and tried to leave, the man punched me in the chest. I pushed him back and he called in locals who began assaulting us. They even claimed my friend was Muslim since he had a beard and being a Brahmin , I was committing a crime by hanging out with him.The assault continued for over half an hour as the men and women abused me for daring to drink and smoke when I was a woman. All the while they continued to beat up my friend. Cops reached the place in some time, but there was more horror in store for us. At the police station, the cops called our parents. Thankfully, my parents are supportive and they stood by me, which possibly angered the officers more. When I told the officer that I wanted to lodge a complaint against the men who attacked us, he refused and threatened to arrest us if we didn’t leave the police station.Finding no other way to fight back, I posted the matter on Facebook, which was shared several times over multiple platforms and the officer in charge called and asked me to come to Dum Dum police station to lodge a complaint. We did so on Wednesday and even identified some of the men in the group. But more than 48 hours have passed and none of them have been arrested. Instead, one of the tormentors has made a Facebook post claiming I attacked him. This man has even dug up some of my old vacation photos from Italy where I was wearing a bikini and reposted them on his profile to cast aspersions on my character.I realise all these activities are meant to demoralise me and tarnish my image. But I will continue my fight and won’t stop till my tormentors are arrested and I get justice."

MUMBAI: A staff nurse at the BMC-run Cooper Hospital was allegedly assaulted late on Tuesday by a pregnant woman, who was irritated over the delay in completion of her discharge formalities and worried that she could catch the infection.The nurses protested against the hospital administration on Wednesday morning for failing to provide them security even as they were putting themselves at risk by working in the hospital during the outbreak.One of the staffers alleged that the woman slapped the nurse, kicked her in the stomach and even flung the medicine trolley around.""The antenatal ward is overflowing now as several private maternity hospitals are shut. The workload is a lot as there are over 20-25 deliveries. The patient got impatient with a doctor and started attacking the nurse. Not one security guard came to her rescue,"" said a nurse, adding that her junior colleague had to seek admission in the hospital as she feared she could not hear properly.The patient took discharge against medical advice and went away, said the nurse.Cooper dean Dr Pinakin Gujjar said that the police would investigate the matter. ""There is fear among all staffers, including security guards, so there is fair bit of absenteeism. We are trying to address that,"" he said.The nurses said the hospital was not following social distancing protocols, particularly in the antenatal ward, where cots were placed next to one another. ""In some of them, there is more than one patient. What if someone comes positive? We also don't get a regular supply of good PPE,"" a nurse added.PPE became a major point of contention at Kasturba Hospital too, where all class IV staffers, including cleaners and ward boys, took a morcha to medical superintendent Dr Chandrakant Pawar's office on Tuesday. The protest was triggered by a show-cause notice issued to a ward boy on Tuesday by the Pawar for recording a video when the hospital staffers were demanding PPE kits. The video had gone viral. The notice issued to the ward boy sought his explanation for defaming the municipal facility."

Mangaluru: Two weeks ago, 48-year-old ASHA worker Tulasi was manhandled and threatened while inquiring about the health status of home-quarantined people in Amtady . She is not alone; several Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA) in Dakshina Kannada continue to be under constant threat while carrying out duties in the fight to contain Covid-19 . So far, the district has registered three such cases.These unsung heroes, who get a paltry pay, put their health at risk while visiting remote villages for surveillance work. Yet, they are humiliated abused, assaulted and threatened. An official said: “ASHA workers visit each household and conduct survey in cities, towns and remote villages. They collect information about people suffering from fever, cold, headache, sore throat or any other symptoms related to coronavirus. They also upload the collected information online through a mobile application and inform officials about individuals needing urgent medical attention.”Based on their survey, higher officials take further decisions. “However, it is sad that people have not recognised their sacrifice,” the official added.While a few such incidents are reported, several attacks go unreported, said a source. An ASHA worker said her family is dissuading her from visiting households for field surveillance over fears of infection. “Worried about infection, my family members have been asking me to stop going to field visits, but I have convinced them to allow me to work. Our help is crucial to government to contain the spread of Covid-19,” she said.*****QuoteWhile everyone is staying home during the lockdown, they (ASHA workers) move around to collect information.

AHMEDABAD: After a 29-year-old woman from the Shahpur area of the city died after delivering a girl child, her relatives ransacked the private hospital in Manekbaug, where caesarean surgery was performed on the woman. The kin of the deceased woman also assaulted an anaesthetist and abducted him.Her relatives forced the anaesthetist, Kalpesh Nakum, to record three video confessions at knifepoint, in which he had to say that the woman, Rukhsarbano Pathan, had died due to his negligence.In his FIR with Ellisbridge police, Nakum said that he had got a call from gynaecologist Dr Dharmishtha Shah of Navkar Hospital near Shreyas Bridge on Wednesday evening. Shah told Nakum that a caesarean surgery needed to be performed immediately.Nakum rushed to the hospital and gave anaesthesia to Pathan in the operation theatre. Shah was present in the operation at the time of surgery. Pathan delivered a healthy girl child but as she was bleeding profusely, she was rushed to the VS Hospital in Ellisbridge area, states the FIR.The doctor stated in the FIR that he stayed at the VS Hospital along with Shah where Pathan’s relatives were also present. At around 8pm, he returned to Navkar Hospital for some paperwork. At around 9.30pm, he heard screams from the reception area of the hospital and when he rushed there, he saw three men, aged between 20 and 30. The three men held Nakum and began beating him. They also ransacked the hospital, states the FIR.One of them hit the anaesthetist on his left eye leaving him severely injured. Then the three men pushed him inside a car parked outside the hospital. While constantly beating Nakum, they took him to an unknown place in Danilimda.For some time, they stopped the car at Danilimda where another two men came and showed a knife to Nakum and forced him to state that the woman had died due to his negligence.They then hired an autorickshaw and told the rickshaw driver to drop him at Narol Circle.After reaching Narol at around 11pm on Wednesday, Nakum gave his location to police who reached there and took him to Ellisbridge police station.Doctors gather at police stationA group of around 20 doctors went to Ellisbridge police station after the incident of abduction and assault came to light. The doctors gathered to represent the issue and to show solidarity with Nakum, said Ellisbridge PI, A S Patel. An official of Ellisbridge police said the deceased’s family was overwhelmed with grief as the woman had died while delivering her first child. The police official said that they did not yet take any statement of the deceased’s family as they were busy in burial. The official said that the postmortem is being conducted at VS Hospital and the cause of death can be ascertained only after receiving the report.Where were the cops?The accused persons abducted Nakum from Manekbaug and the car passed by Bhudarpura, Parimal Garden, Mahalakshmi Crossroads, Jamalpur, Behrampura, and finally went to Danilimda area. During this time, they were constantly beating the doctor. But not a single cop spotted the offence and even control room cops, who are said to monitor CCTV cameras on road to prevent crimes, missed the incident.

HYDERABAD: A police constable was suspended in Wanaparthy for thrashing a man in public, right in front of his minor son as he pleaded for his father to be spared in full view of half-a-dozen police personnel.Though the incident happened on Wednesday, it snowballed into a major controversy on Thursday with IT minister KT Rama Rao rebuking the “attitude of police” and saying “it is unacceptable in ANY circumstances” on a micro-blogging site after the video of the incident went viral on social media.On Wednesday evening, one Murali Krishna along with his 10-year-old son was travelling on a two-wheeler in Wanaparthy. They were stopped by traffic police personnel and asked why they were defying lockdown norms.“Murali told police that he was travelling from his residence to his mother-in-law’s house, which was about five kilometres away. When he was told that during the lockdown period they are not supposed to travel, Murali picked up an argument,’’ Wanaparthy inspector Surya Naik said.Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) constable Ashok Kumar, who was in mufti, checked for pending challans against the vehicle number and found there were 13 pending challans worth Rs 2,820.When police informed him that his bike would be seized due to pending challans and violating lockdown norms, Murali reportedly picked up an argument with them. “For nearly 20 minutes, Murali refused to give the vehicle and later slapped constable Ashok Kumar,” the inspector said.An infuriated Ashok caught Murali by the collar and started raining blows and hurling choicest expletives even as the latter’s son was pleading with him not to hit his father. Ashok pushed aside half-a-dozen police personnel, including traffic cops, and pinned him to the ground and continued his assault . A traffic constable too joined him and kicked Murali. A little later, Murali along with his son, who was crying for mercy, was forcibly put in a police vehicle and taken away. The incident was captured on phone by a bystander, a journalist of regional media. Murali was taken to police station and later let off.However, police denied he was beaten in their custody.The video landed on social media and one Twitter user tagged IT minister KT Rama Rao. The minister reacted, “Dear HM Mahmood Ali Saab & @TelanganaDGP Garu, this attitude of police is unacceptable in ANY circumstances. Request you to take the strictest action on incidents such as this... All the exceptionally good work of thousands of policemen is undone by the erratic behaviour of few (sic).”Replying to the minister, Wanaparthy SP Apoorva Rao apologised to the public and said disciplinary action was initiated. “We apologise to public for such behaviour by an on-duty constable,” the SP tweeted. The constable was later suspended."

NEW YORK: Harvey Weinstein was sentenced Wednesday to 23 years in prison for rape and sexual assault, a sight the Hollywood mogul's multitude of accusers thought they would never see.Weinstein, who has been accused of violating scores of women, was convicted last month of raping a woman in a New York City hotel room in 2013 and forcibly performing oral sex on another woman at his apartment in 2006. He faced a maximum of 29 years in prison.Both women that Weinstein was convicted of assaulting a once-aspiring actress and a former TV and film production assistant spoke in court Wednesday before Judge James Burke announced the sentence, confronting Weinstein again after their testimony helped seal his conviction at the landmar #MeToo trial.Burke also heard from Weinstein's lawyers, who pleaded for leniency because of his age and frail health, and prosecutors, who said the man once celebrated as a titan of Hollywood deserved a harsh sentence that would account for allegations of wrongdoing dating to the 1970s.Harvey Weinstein told a court Wednesday that the men facing allegations in the #MeToo movement are being accused of ""things that none of us understood,'' saying he was confused by the rape case that was about to put him in prison.""Thousands of men are losing due process. I'm worried about this country,'' the disgraced Hollywood mogul said after two of his accusers confronted him in court.Weinstein faced at least five years and up to 29 years behind bars in the landmark #MeToo case. He was convicted of raping an aspiring actress in 2013 and forcibly performing oral sex on former TV and film production assistant Mimi Haleyi in 2006. A second criminal case is pending in California.Onlookers applauded the two women whom Weinstein was convicted of assaulting as they arrived in court.Haleyi broke into tears as she told Judge James Burke that the 2006 attack scarred her deeply, made her rethink her career in the entertainment business and left her feeling paranoid and afraid of retaliation. She said she avoids dating because she doesn't want to hurt people, have them feel embarrassed or distance themselves when they find out what happened to her.""I believe that if Harvey Weinstein was not convicted by this jury, it would happen again and again and again,'' Haleyi said.The once-aspiring actress that Weinstein was convicted of raping in 2013 recalled the moment during the trial when she left the witness stand in tears and then could be heard screaming from an adjacent room.""The day my screams were heard from the witness room was the day my voice came back to its full power,'' she said.""Rape is not just one moment of penetration. It is forever.''She said she was a victim of ""rape paralysis'' caused by a physically imposing assailant ""who had every advantage over me."" Like many of Weinstein's accusers, she said he used his Hollywood prestige to befriend her, dangling professional prospects to gain her trust.""It takes a very special kind of evil to exploit connections to leverage rape,'' she said.The Associated Press has a policy of not naming people who have been sexually assaulted without their consent. It is withholding the rape accuser's name because it is not clear whether she wishes to be identified.Prosecutors asked for a sentence at or near the maximum.Weinstein, who has maintained that any sexual any sexual activity was consensual, said he had fond memories of his accusers.Looking back during the trial at emails they exchanged, he said, he thought they had a good friendship: ""I'm not going to say these aren't great people. I had wonderful times with these people. I'm just genuinely confused. Men are confused about this issue.''Weinstein's lawyers are seeking the minimum sentence of five years in prison because of his age and frail health. Attorney Arthur Aidala told the court the ex-mogul was a ``broken-down man.''Weinstein, who turns 68 next week, used a walker throughout the trial following recent back surgeries and arrived in the courthouse Wednesday in a wheelchair. After his Feb. 24 conviction, he split time between a hospital and a jail infirmary unit, and had a stent inserted last week to unblock an artery.Four other women who testified against him, including ""Sopranos"" actress Annabella Sciorra, sat side-by-side in the courtroom audience but weren't permitted to speak at his sentencing under state law.One of those witnesses, Tarale Wulff, who accused Weinstein of raping her in 2005, said in a statement Tuesday that she hoped that the sentence ""sends a clear message that times have changed.""The executive behind such Oscar-winning films as ""Shakespeare in Love"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" became Exhibit A for the #MeToo movement after years of whispers about his alleged behavior burst into public view in The New York Times and The New Yorker in 2017.More than 90 women, including actresses Gwyneth Paltrow, Salma Hayek and Uma Thurman, eventually came forward to accuse Weinstein of sexual assault and sexual harassment. The takedown energized the #MeToo campaign of speaking up about sexual assault and holding perpetrators accountable.One of Weinstein's lawyers, Donna Rotunno, told the court he faced an uphill fight from the start of the trial, with media coverage of his allegations and the #MeToo movement making it impossible for him to get a truly fair shake.``How can we deny the fact that what happened before we walked in here had an impact?'' Rotunno asked.Weinstein was convicted on two counts: criminal sex act for the 2006 assault and rape in the third degree for the 2013 attack. He was acquitted of first-degree rape and two counts of predatory sexual assault stemming from Sciorra's allegations of a mid-1990s rape.Newly unsealed documents show the 67-year-old former film producer sought help from billionaires Jeff Bezos and Michael Bloomberg as sexual misconduct allegations against him piled up in October 2017, and that he considered issuing a statement at the time claiming that he was suicidal. There is no evidence to suggest either man responded.After sentencing, Weinstein will be transferred to the state prison system.Martin Horn, a former city corrections commissioner, said Weinstein's celebrity status could make him a target for another inmate looking to make a name for himself, while the gravity of his convictions and sentence could raise suicide concerns.``They're going to make sure that nothing happens to him while he's in their custody. Not because he's important, but just from a public relations point of view, it would be awfully embarrassing,`` said Horn, who now teaches at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.Just as jury selection was about to get under way in the New York case in January, Weinstein was charged in California with raping a woman at a Los Angeles hotel on Feb. 18, 2013 and sexually assaulting a woman in a Beverly Hills hotel suite the next night."

NEW DELHI/WASHINGTON: The government rejected the observations on India in the USCIRF annual report, which had accused India of allowing harassment of Muslims and violence against them, saying the US federal government entity’s misrepresentation of India had reached new levels.The report on India was rejected by two of its own commissioners. “Its biased and tendentious comments against India are not new. But on this occasion, its misrepresentation has reached new levels,” MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), which claims to monitor religious freedom around the world, asked the state department to designate 14 nations, including India, as countries of particular concern ( CPC ), alleging that religious minorities were under increasing assault in these nations.However, two of its nine members expressed dissent over USCIRF recommendation to place India in the CPC."

The Madras high court refused to make public the chargesheet filed by the CBI in the Pollachi sex scam case as it was objected to by the agency in the interest of the victims of the abuse. “Even the trial before the sessions court is likely to be conducted in-camera to protect the identities of the victims. In such case, making the charge-sheet public would not be against the interest of the victims,” counsel for the CBI said on Monday.The issue pertains to a batch of PIL moved by a group of women lawyers practising in the high court, All India Democratic Women’s Association (AIDWA) and the Tamil Nadu Association of Women Advocates to constitute a fact-finding team headed by a senior woman advocate and a retired woman police officer to go into the facts of the case.The petitioners also wanted the court to direct the CBI to appoint a senior woman officer to head the team probing the case monitored by the court. When the PILs came up for hearing before the first bench of Acting Chief Justice Vineet Kothari and Justice C Saravanan, the petitioners wanted the court to direct the CBI to provide them copies of the charge-sheet.Opposing the same, the CBI submitted that if the petitioners wanted to assist the prosecution they can do so by approaching the trial court concerned. Recording the submissions, the bench said: “We permit the petitioners to espouse the cause of the victims with the intention that it should not recur in future to approach the investigation officer concerned and supply to him the relevant materials which they have and assist in the future investigation in the manner known to law.”The court then directed the CBI to file relevant case documents in a sealed cover to the court and posted the plea to December 3 for further hearing."

AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Monday refused temporary bail to Asumal Harpalani alias Asaram , who wanted to come out of jail claiming that he would contract the coronavirus if he remained behind bars.Asaram (84) is accused in a rape case registered at Chandkheda police station. He was arrested in October 2013 but has been lodged in a prison in Jodhpur, because he has been convicted in another case of sexual assault on a minor girl.Seeking release from jail for four months, Asaram cited his advanced age and poor health to show his vulnerability to the infectious disease. His advocate submitted, ""Considering the age and condition of the applicant, he would be more vulnerable to the Covid-19 and therefore, this is a fit case to grant temporary bail to the applicant as prayed for.""Asaram's lawyers also cited the Supreme Court's order to various state governments to release prisoners so the risk of the spread of coronavirus could be curbed inside prisons.The public prosecutor vehemently objected the bail plea. After hearing the state government, Justice Bela Trivedi rejected Asaram's bail plea for four months with the observation. ""It also appears that his regular bail applications were not granted by this court as well as by the Supreme Court. The case of the applicant also does not fall under any of the categories mentioned in the guidelines issued by the High Power Committee constituted pursuant to the order passed by the Supreme Court.""The committee recommended the release of those undertrial prisoners who are behind bars on charges punishable with imprisonment up to seven years.Asaram is facing charges in which the maximum punishment is life imprisonment after the amendments to the laws against sexual assault after the Nirbhaya rape case"

GHAZIABAD: All cases related to assault and criminal intimidation will be lodged as FIRs from now on, instead of non-cognizable offence reports (NCRs) for which a magistrate’s permission is needed to carry out probe.Ghaziabad SSP Kalanidhi Naithani said the current system of lodging such cases as NCRs stalls probe and also fails to redress the complainants’ grievances. “In Uttar Pradesh , except for Ghaziabad, cases related to IPC sections 506 (criminal intimidation) are registered as FIR. This should not be done and I have directed all police stations to register FIRs under IPC sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), besides IPC Section 506, and start the investigation immediately,” he said.Police officers said that in NCR cases, a preliminary inquiry is conducted to check if the allegations are correct and if it is found that further probe is needed, a permission is sought from the magistrate. A complainant can approach the magistrate and seek a directive on the basis of an NCR for police to register a case.Naithani said the move is aimed at providing comfort to the complainants, who have already suffered injuries and had been threatened.The SSP has also directed all SHOs to lodge cybercrime cases at police stations and not make complainants go to cyber cells."

But on this occasion, its misrepresentation has reached new levels,” MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), which claims to monitor religious freedom around the world, asked the state department to designate 14 nations, including India, as countries of particular concern ( CPC ), alleging that religious minorities were under increasing assault in these nations.However, two of its nine members expressed dissent over USCIRF recommendation to place India in the CPC."

NEW DELHI: Recounting her ordeal on the night of Sunday, January 5, JNU Students’ Union president Aishe Ghosh remembered how she was beaten with iron rods by 20 men, who left a deep gash on her head. At a press conference called to rebut the Delhi Police’s identification of nine JNU students as those involving in violence, Ghosh accused the cops of being hand-in-glove with ABVP, the RSS-affiliated student organisation.“Masked men repeated hammered my head with iron rods. There are videos of this. But even then, I didn’t name ABVP or any organisation as the assailants, only demanded justice,” said an emotional Ghosh. “When there are screenshots of WhatsApp groups where ABVP members are openly happy about my injuries, how I can roam freely on the campus?”She accused the university administration and police of colluding in the violence.“They say it was a scuffle between students and teachers, that it was a fight between Right and Left. But it is a fight between right and wrong,” Ghosh continued.Giving a chronology of events, and alleging that police at Friday’s press meet showed pictures that were circulated by ABVP, the students’ union listed the names of 29 students it suspected of involvement in the Sabarmati Hostel mayhem and of some JNU teachers for “attacking students.”There were accusation that several teachers had incited the attackers and even beaten up some students. JNUSU named Ashwini Mohapatra, dean, School of International Studies, and Mazhar Asif, associate dean, School of Languages, as guilty of this. The teachers vociferously refuted these charges and called them baseless. Asif categorically told TOI, “I was not involved in any violence.”Ghosh also alleged that on January 5, she saw Periyar Hostel warden Tapan Bihari handing lathis to masked men who were emerging from his house. “How can the administration call for a security audit of hostels where even wardens are involved in violence?” she asked. While Bihari was not available for a comment, posters have cropped up calling him the ‘traitor of JNU.’Responding to the naming of 29 students, Durgesh Kumar, president, JNU ABVP unit, retorted, “The matter is under investigation by police right now, and these allegations are baseless.”Satish Chandra Yadav, JNUSU general secretary, however, claimed a nexus between police and ABVP. “Police conducted a press conference hurriedly and named leftist organisations, but not once did they take ABVP’s name. They have based their findings on pictures that have gone viral, but what is the authenticity of these images. And why have pictures with ABVP activists not been considered?” he asked.In response, a police officer asserted, “The investigation is based on evidence so far, there is no bias. This is the first of many press briefings in the case. The investigation has only started and efforts are being made to identify other suspects.”Contrary to police’s explanation on Friday, JNUSU claimed that violence on January 4 was triggered by ABVP activists attacking anti-fee hike protesters at the School of Biotechnology. It said ABVP activists, including Sarvendra Kumar, were seen attacking a student affiliated to leftist student organisation, AISA. The video of that incident was shared by the government’s Press Information Bureau twitter handle alleging that the attacker was a leftist activist. This tweet was also retweeted by vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar.On January 5, JNUSU alleged, violence began in the morning when students were beaten near the administrative block despite the presence of police in plainclothes. There was no response when police were informed. Ghosh claimed, “Later, at 4pm, when a police van arrived at Periyar Hostel, the cops only watched the ABVP activists indulging in stone pelting.”Ghosh informed that a demonstration was planned at Police Headquarters at ITO on Monday against the “shoddy investigation” and the “police’s Islamophobia unleashed on Jamia students”."

KOLKATA: A youth in his 20s was arrested on the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass near Mukundapur on Thursday evening for allegedly assaulting a traffic sergeant and attempting to flee the area pushing him away when the sergeant had stopped him from driving dangerously after he had hit two pedestrians. The youth, Dipankar Das , was charged with rash driving and preventing a government employee from discharge of his duty.The motorcycle Dipankar Das (23) was riding did not belong to him and also had a ‘Police’ written on the number plate and officials of Survey Park police station are probing whether the owner had some ulterior motive.Around 7.30pm, Suman Kalyan Dhak, a traffic sergeant of the Purba Jadavpur Traffic Guard was on duty near the Mukundapur crossing when Das approached the Bypass from near the Metro Cash & Carry outlet at high speed and attempted to turn right towards the Ruby crossing. There were some pedestrians at the crossing and Das crashed into them.When the pedestrians admonished the youth for such irresponsible behaviour, he turned upon them and a scuffle ensued. Dhak intervened and was pushed away by Das. The youth then tried to start his motorcycle and speed away but was prevented from doing so by another police personnel and Somnath Sarkar , SI of the Survey Park police station. This was when they spotted that the motorcycle sported the ‘Police’ sticker.“We asked him about the sticker but he claimed that the motorcycle belonged to a neighbour in the Kalikapur slums.

Meanwhile, Das has been charged under Sections 279 and 353 of the IPC,” a police official said.After spending the night in custody, Das was produced in court on Friday. The court granted him bail on condition that he performs a few hours of community service every day by serving with the traffic police.Since last week, the Kolkata Police have resumed Naka Checks at important crossings to curb rash driving. “Those involved in rash driving or found drunk while at the wheel are being charged accordingly.

COIMBATORE: The Coimbatore police arrested four people after they trespassed into a nationalised bank at Singanallur and assaulted its bank manager on Monday.The video of the manager being dragged by shirt out of the bank has been circulating on social media.The accused were identified as R Loganathan, 37, a resident of Neelikonampalayam, G Dinesh, 28, a resident of Pollachi, S Ashwinram, 34, and S Prakash, 28, residents of Madurai.A police officer said Kathamuthu was working as peon at the Peelamedu branch of the bank and he had availed voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) on February 12.As the peon was not responding to any of the phone calls, one of his money lenders L Kalamani had approached the manager P Elangovan, 59, seeking assistance to know when Kathamuthu’s VRS amount would be sanctioned, the officer said.Based on her request, the manager had called her on February 19 to inform her that the peon’s VRS amount was released and the next day, the woman turned up with a cheque for Rs 9.26 lakh to withdraw the amount. But the cheque was returned as his account did not have sufficient amount, the officer explained.“The woman had then straight away walked into manager’s cabin and asked him to help to withdraw the entire amount that is in Kathamuthu’s account. She had offered to provide a commission for it, but the manager had declined it saying he does not expect anything but love in turn,” the official explained.A few days after the incident, Kalamani’s husband Loganathan had trespassed into the bank and had abused the manager even though he was not available, the officer said.“On Monday, Loganathan along with his friends trespassed into the bank and verbally abused the manager before assaulting him. The group broke multiple items including computer at his cabin. He was later dragged by his shirt out of the bank and was assaulted again before fleeing the spot,” the officer said.The group alleged that the manager had attempted to misbehave with the woman.

He told the police that his daughter was missing since 1.45am.The Sangvi police immediately swung into action. “Later in the day, the girls’ body was found in a trench filled with water near the colony of the construction workers,” Shinde said.Suspecting involvement of someone from the locality, the police questioned 30 construction workers. “Of them, we detained six, including the suspect,” Shinde said.He said when the police checked the suspect’s cellphone, it was found active from 10pm on Monday to 1am on Tuesday. “When we checked the phone’s browsing history, we found that he was watching porn clips during that period,” Shinde said.The police then zeroed in on him. During the sustained interrogation, the suspect admitted that he had raped and killed the girl after watching the clips, Shinde said.Shinde said the suspect went to the girl’s room around 1.45am on Tuesday. She was sleeping next to her father.The suspect picked her up, went near a washroom in the workers’ colony and sexually assaulted her. He then strangulated her to death, dumped her body in the trench and returned to his room. “We have recovered the girl’s clothes,” Shinde said.The team investigating the case comprised assistant inspector Ganesh Kharge and sub-inspectors Shrikant Patil and Govind Chavan."

An FIR has been lodged against the man.In her complaint to police , Nisha Shukla said she married Anuj Shukla of Unnao in 2012. A year later, the couple had their first daughter.

BHOPAL: The state Congress on Thursday alleged that two ministers of the Kamal Nath government were assaulted and arrested by Bangalore police when they went to the resort where 19 MLAs have been lodged, allegedly by BJP. Congress may move Supreme Court since it has become an “inter-state and even national issue”.With the clock ticking down to the arrival of Jyotiraditya Scindia in Bhopal, senior Congress leaders Digvijaya Singh and Vivek Tankha held a press meet where they showed dramatic videos of ministers Jitu Patwari and Lakhan Singh Yadav being shoved around in Bengaluru.The two ministers had gone to the resort along with Narayan Choudhary, father of MLA Manoj Choudhary who is one of the 19 legislators cooped up in the resort. Patwari is a relative of Manoj Choudhary. Digvijaya and Tankha showed videos of how Patwari, Lakhan and Narayan Choudhary were allegedly manhandled by police, bodily lifted into a police bus and taken away. Choudhary is seen in the videos in a pair of swimming shorts and with a towel around his neck.“This is a case of abduction and forced captivity,” Tankha, an eminent lawyer, said. “You abduct and take our MLAs to a different region, and hold them hostage. They cannot even contact their families as their mobile phones have been taken away. They are not there out of free will. A BJP delegation, led by senior leaders takes resignations from MLAs on Holi and returns to Bhopal to submit them to the Speaker. No one knows under what circumstances these resignations were taken from our MLAs,” Tankha said.Tankha alleged that the ministers were assaulted and arrested. “After speaking to his father, Manoj wanted to return. To release people held captive is the duty of every citizen. Our ministers were trying to do what police should have done. They were assaulted and arrested because a father wanted to bring his son home. This is condemnable,” he argued.“We demand that Bangalore police immediately take punitive action against those officers, and release our ministers and MLAs. Otherwise, we may have to move Supreme Court. We could have gone to high court but this is an issue between two states. This has become a national issue now — how MLAs from Madhya Pradesh have been abducted, held captive, are being pressurized and their relatives being beaten,” Tankha said.“We are consulting Kapil Sibal (former Union minister and Supreme Court lawyer) and, maybe, will move Supreme Court and tell how the country’s democracy is in danger. What BJP is doing is a criminal act and an unbiased probe should be conducted by the apex court because BJP-led Centre will not be interested,” he said.Regarding the resignations of 22 Congress MLAs submitted by former BJP minister Bhupendra Singh to Speaker NP Prajapati on March 10, Tankha said, “Under Constitution and the law, a Speaker, whether of Congress or BJP, has only one option — to investigate these resignations. Notices have been sent so that the MLAs may present themselves and discuss with the Speaker. Two years ago, when Jagan Mohan Reddy’s MPs faced a similar situation, then Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan conducted an inquiry for two months.”Speaker NP Prajapati issued notices to six ministers on Wednesday. Prajapati said seven MLAs have been issued notices on Thursday."

JODHPUR: Having come to India after being persecuted in Pakistan, Doctor Noorji Bheel from University of Sindh has tasted hardships on Indian soil, too.Bheel, who practiced medicine in Jodhpur, was not only arrested by police along with two quacks, but also allegedly beaten for protesting his arrest last Saturday.Bheel was granted bail by the sessions judge (Jodhpur Metropolitan) on Tuesday. The treatment he was meted out has turned the spotlight on the future of many of qualified doctors who migrated from Pakistan and who inspite of having an MBBS are not able to practice without MCI permission Protesting against the incident, an organisation working for migrants, Seemant Lok Sangthan, has decided to take a legal course against police for its ‘atrocities’ on a qualified doctor but has also decided to push for a regime which allows medical practice by these migrated doctors following their persecution in Pakistan.“It was very unfortunate that a qualified doctor from Pakistan, migrated to India, was treated inappropriately and was subjected to another persecution here,” said Hindu Singh Sodha, president of the sangthan.He added that he was not a quack and deserved to be served a notice by the CMHO first directing him to show permission by MCI.“Failing in providing the permission, he could simply have been barred from practicing. But treating him on a par with quacks and beating him was nothing but categorically a partisan behavior and a targeted action,” said Sodha.Though the SHO (Chopasni Housing Board) Parmeshwari declined the allegations, another doctor, Rajkumar, a qualified dentist from Pakistan, who had gone to police after hearing of Noorji’s arrest, claimed that he also was beaten by police when he simply sought to know his guilt.Aggrieved by the incident, a delegation of doctors from Pakistan, submitted a memorandum to the district magistrate demanding a legal action against police for its alleged misbehavior with the medic followed by an inquiry into the matter.“We have also prayed for taking up our case with the ministry of health and family welfare and MCI for granting us permission to practice medicine in India with regard to the Scheme of Reciprocity 1992-1999,” said Raj Kumar.Noorji had come to India from Sangad district of Sindh province in 2002 with his family and has been still awaiting citizenship, even after 18 years."

COIMBATORE: Even as the government machinery has plunged into action to contain tension sparked by communal elements in Coimbatore, a gang assaulted a member of a Hindu outfit on Wednesday evening.Two men wearing helmets barged into the shop of Suryaprakash, 28, an RSS functionary, near Sundarapuram in the city outskirts around 6.30pm. The men assaulted Suryaprakash with rods and fled the place within moments in a motorbike. Soon after the attack, Suryaprakash, who sustained injuries on his head and in arms, went to a private hospital for treatment in his friend’s bike as a pillion rider. Police who rushed to the spot and conducted inquiries said they are yet to identify the assailants and the motive.Incidentally, the attack took place when DGP J K Tripathy who flew down to Coimbatore in the afternoon, was holding a meeting with senior cops in the city on measures to be taken to contain the violent attacks.On Tuesday night, unidentified men who were travelling on a two-wheeler had hurled stones at the auto of A Sheriff, 32, a resident of Kuniyamuthur, when he was traveling near Puttuvikki road in the city.Tripathy has instructed the officials to step up vigil in the city and crack down on the anti–social elements sparking tension.

The collector told the functionaries that communal clash would pull down the growth of Coimbatore at a time when the city is bracing up for massive development.Rajamani said both the district administration and police department was taking steps to ensure law and order in the city. “Following a few unpleasant incidents that took place in the city, meetings were conducted with outfits and they had assured to extend their full support to us. We have been taking serious steps to bring normalcy in the city,’’ he said.He warned of stringent action against those who spread fake or hatred messages in social media."

LUCKNOW: Panic gripped residents of a posh colony in Aashiana Sunday night when an ex-serviceman, accompanied by at least 25 people, allegedly assaulted security guards for thrashing his son over a trivial issue.Cops have arrested ex-serviceman Atul Singh and recovered a double-barrel gun and two hockey sticks.Supervisor of a private security company, Manoj Kumar Yadav, lodged an FIR at Aashiana police station against Atul Singh, two aides and 25 unidentified men for rioting, assault, criminal intimidation and insult.Cops, however, claimed when they reached the spot they found only three men and two SUVs.In the FIR, Yadav claimed that residents of the colony complained to guards at around 8.20pm about disturbance and noise created by six boys and a girl, all students of class 10, in the park located in the middle of the compound.Yadav said he found that the girl was a resident of the colony but the boys were outsiders. He asked the boys to leave the compound and escorted all of them till the gate.At around 10pm, two guards – Arvind and Alok – informed Yadav that about 25 men had entered the colony in 10 SUVs and were assaulting and abusing them.One of the guards also informed the police.“There was panic in the colony for some time after so many men entered the colony hurling abuses and threats. Thankfully, cops came on time,” said a resident who did not wish to be quoted.However, Aashiana SHO Vishwajeet Singh said when the cops reached the spot they found only two SUVs and three men. “We searched the SUVs and found two hockey sticks and a double-barrel licensed gun belonging to the ex-armyman who has been named in the FIR and later arrested. He was in an inebriated state at that time,” Singh said.“The gun and SUVs have been seized. The accused denied charges of assault and told us that the guard slapped and humiliated two boys, including his son, while forcing them to leave the colony. He said he reached the colony to talk to the guards,” the SHO said, adding that the cops were scanning CCTV cameras installed in the colony and recording the statements of both sides to ascertain the sequence of events."

MUMBAI: There has been a nearly 10% increase in registration of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) cases, including those related to rape and molestation, in 2018 as compared to the previous year, a Mumbai Police report showed. Also, between January 2015 and May 2019, 4,551 POCSO cases were registered in the city, of which 529 were filed this year till May.According to the police, the rise in number of cases is due to awareness as children are now confiding in their parents about such incidents. The director of non-partisan organization Praja, Milind Muske, attributed the rise to the fact that parents are educating their children about 'good touch' and 'bad touch'.Former state DGP Pravin Dixit told TOI: ""The POCSO Act is intended to provide protection to children who have no voice and continue to suffer ignominiously."" The POCSO Act was framed in 2012 to protect children from offences of sexual assault, sexual harassment and pornography, and 597 such courts were set up across the country to ensure trials were completed within a year from registration of FIR. To strengthen the Act, last week, the Union cabinet approved amendments by including death penalty for aggravated sexual assault on children, besides providing stringent punishments for other crimes against minors.But data complied by the law ministry in 2018 showed that pendency of POCSO cases is piling up, with Maharashtra topping the table with 17,338 cases pending in court till 2016. Uttar Pradesh came second with 15,938 cases followed by Madhya Pradesh with 10,950 cases. One such pending case recently saw justice after four long years. On July 1, Amboli resident Sanjay Kadam (55) was convicted to 10 years' jail under the POCSO Act by a sessions court for raping his neighbour's 16-year-old son. ""He was in judicial custody since his arrest in 2015,"" said D N Nagar police senior inspector Parmeshwar Ganme.A police officer said a majority of the rape survivors are in the age group of 12-17, and a few of them have got into physical relationship with adults through consent. But as minors' consent is not considered, the suspect, is charged under the Act. Of the 529 cases registered this year, 235 were related to rape and 252 to molestation.Former IPS officer S P S Yadav pointed out that though the Act helps protect children, any stringent law has the potential of becoming 'double-edged sword' unless carefully handled by the police. IPS officer-turned-lawyer YP Singh claimed the Act is sometimes used to settle scores related to civil and criminal disputes. ""...since the Act gives an overwhelming level of credibility to the victim's statement, it has become prone to misuse,"" he said.DCP Manjunath Singe, who is also Mumbai Police spokesperson, told TOI: ""A majority of the cases registered under the POCSO Act are genuine; though there are a few who misuse this Act for personal reasons like revenge."""

Vellore: A Class VI student of a government aided high school at Kasam near Katpadi has dropped out of school after she was sexually assaulted by her 45-year-old teacher. Based on a report by the Vellore district child protection officer, the school management placed the teacher under suspension from Wednesday.P Nishanthini, district child protection officer of Vellore, said that based on a tip received on WhatsApp, on Monday child protection officials paid a visit to the school which has around 250 boys and girls studying in Class VI to X.“When we checked the attendance register of Class VI, the victim was marked absent from February 3. Inquiries revealed that the girl was unable to recover from the trauma and decided to drop out of school. We, along with the child welfare committee, are initiating steps to find the girl now with her distant relative and make her continue studies in a school she prefers,” Nishanthini said.Quoting a girl student, Nishanthini said the victim stayed at her grandmother’s house near the school. Suresh Kumar, 45, her class teacher, had been molesting the girl for more than six months after taking her to remote spots during class hours and had threatened her of dire consequences if she reveals it to her relatives, Nishanthini said. “A month ago some Class X students caught Suresh Kumar sexually assaulting the girl and informed the victim’s grandmother. From February 3, the girl stopped attending school,” she added.When TOI contacted a relative of the girl, he said that over the past two years, more than three sexual assault complaints were lodged against Suresh Kumar by parents of three girl students. However, the headmaster of the school issued only a warning instead of escalating the matter to the management and education department, he said. “We demand appropriate action both against Suresh Kumar and the headmaster,” he added.Meanwhile, based on a report by the district child protection unit, the management launched a departmental inquiry against Suresh Kumar."

NEW DELHI/WASHINGTON: The government rejected the observations on India in the USCIRF annual report, which had accused India of allowing harassment of Muslims and violence against them, saying the US federal government entity’s misrepresentation of India had reached new levels.The report on India was rejected by two of its own commissioners. “Its biased and tendentious comments against India are not new. But on this occasion, its misrepresentation has reached new levels,” MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), which claims to monitor religious freedom around the world, asked the state department to designate 14 nations, including India, as countries of particular concern ( CPC ), alleging that religious minorities were under increasing assault in these nations.However, two of its nine members expressed dissent over USCIRF recommendation to place India in the CPC."

NEW DELHI: Expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar and six others, including two UP policemen, were convicted on Wednesday of “culpable homicide not amounting to murder” in the death of the Unnao rape survivor’s father.According to special judge Dharmesh Sharma, the accused demonstrated their “political and muscle power” to criminally intimidate the deceased and his family and deter them from pursuing the sexual assault case against Sengar. While framing charges in August last year, the court had viewed the death as “part of a larger conspiracy to deter, silence and prevent the father from pursuing the complaint” regarding the rape of his daughter in 2017. The court will hear arguments on the quantum of punishment on March 12.Besides Sengar, the court convicted then Makhi police station in-charge Ashok Singh Bhadauria, sub-inspector K P Singh, and Vineet Mishra Birendra Singh , Shashi Pratap Singh and Atul Singh , Sengar’s brother. It came on record that the man was brutally assaulted but charges of assault, criminal intimidation and possession of firearms were made against him."

Ludhiana: Taking note of alleged inaction in case of “assault” on a city advocate, the Punjab and Haryana high court on Tuesday gave two days to the Punjab authorities to take action.The court of Justice Lisa Gill adjourned the case till Thursday.Advocate Varun Gupta, who was allegedly beaten up by Ludhiana STF in-charge Harbans Singh, had moved the high court, seeking strict action against the cop. On February 25, in his complaint to the police commissioner and the STF AIG, he had said that a day before when he was returning to Ludhiana from Delhi with his father, who was on a catheter, and driver, STF in-charge Harbans Singh beat him up and maltreated his father at an eatery near Doraha.During the hearing of the case, the counsel for the petitioner said no action had been taken against Harbans Singh, who was exerting undue influence by virtue of being posted as the in-charge of Ludhiana STF.Jaskaran Singh, Ludhiana Range IGP, produced status report by way of an affidavit and the court took it on record. The respondent submitted that there were some contradictions between the two complaints submitted by the petitioner. The state submitted that an FIR was not registered as the report of the Payal SDM was awaited.The court observed that a perusal of the complaints prima facie revealed that there were consistent allegations of physical abuse at the hands of the STF in-charge, which do not appear to be at variance with each other.The court said that at this stage, IGP Jaskaran Singh informs that as per information received by him, Harbans Singh will be transferred.The court adjourned the case with a remark, “Needless to say, it is expected that necessary action in accordance with law shall be taken by the authorities.”DPS Randhawa, who is president of the HC bar association, said the court also said that this was a welfare state and not a police state and the common man’s faith in police should not be eroded.“The judge asked the state counsel to register an FIR. It was observed that police action was eyewash and they are investigating without an FIR. The IGP was asked to explain what they had done in confidence-building when the erring officer was still at that post,” Randhawa said."

Ludhiana: Taking serious note of a viral video of an SHO allegedly assaulting and making three persons stand nude at a police station in Khanna, Punjab DGP Dinkar Gupta on Thursday directed IGP (Ludhiana Range) Jaskaran Singh to carry out a fact-finding inquiry into the matter and submit a report at the earliest.Reiterating zero tolerance policy of Punjab Police on such issues, Gupta said necessary action would be initiated against the delinquent officers on the basis of the enquiry report.Meanwhile, the Khanna SSP claimed that one of the persons in the video — farmer Jagpal Singh of Daheen village under Sadar police station, Khanna, was already facing 15 criminal cases in Khanna police district. While the trial court had found him guilty in 4 cases, three cases were still pending in the court.While the official release by the government claimed that no complaint has been received by Khanna police and a suo moto cognizance was taken on the basis of this video, Jagpal’s counsel Guninder Singh claimed that he had lodged a complaint against the officer with the DGP, Chief Minister, Human Rights Commission etc.“We got the video of the same four days back and made a formal complaint the next day. We could not approach Punjab and Haryana high court due to ongoing lockdown. “Following the complaint, the DGP office marked the complaint to SSP Khanna to look into the matter,” he claimed.The Khanna SSP said the video is almost 10-month old as per the accused. The SSP said in order to verify the authenticity of the video, an inquiry has already been marked to the SP (H) Khanna, who had initiated a probe on April 15. The report is still awaited.In the 9-second video, three persons are allegedly standing nude before the SHO, whose voice is audible only, but his face is not visible.Guninder Singh claimed his client had some land related dispute with a villager and later Sadar police called him to the police station following a complaint. He said on June 12 last year, police had taken Jagpal, his 14-year-old son and worker to the police station where the SHO Sadar Khanna thrashed them up in his room (office) after getting their clothes removed.He also claimed that the next day, the SHO booked him in a land tilling and theft case and sent him to jail.Guninder said that they could have moved the high court, but they didn’t have proof of whether video was made by officer or not. Jagpal along with his advocate met IGP (Ludhiana range) Jaskaran Singh on Thursday. Guninder said the IGP listened to them patiently and got the statement of his client recorded.IG Ludhiana range Jaskaran Singh said there is a complaint against SHO Sadar Khanna Baljinder Singh and SSP Khanna has been asked for time-bound probe into the matter.The SSP Khanna said a departmental inquiry has been initiated against the officer."

PUNE: A sessions court on Monday convicted and sentenced a Kondhwa resident to three years of rigorous imprisonment for stalking, trespassing and sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and threatening and outraging the modesty of her mother on December 18, 2016.According to the case put up by the prosecution, the convict, Akash Chandu Shetty, stayed in the vicinity of the girl’s residence and would follow her on her way to and from school. He would touch her inappropriately, while insisting that she should marry him.On the night of the incident, he barged into the girl’s house and threatened her mother that he would abduct the girl. When the mother confronted him, the man abused and touched her inappropriately while threatening her to eliminate the family if they opposed his abduction plan, the prosecution stated.On a previous occasion too, the accused had called the girl’s mother on phone and used filthy and abusive language to threaten that he would kill her son, the prosecution added.The girl’s mother then lodged an FIR with the Kondhwa police against Shetty.

NEW YORK: Former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein was convicted of sexual assault by a New York jury on Monday but acquitted on the most serious charges that could have sent him to prison for the rest of his life.Once one of Hollywood's most powerful producers, Weinstein, 67, was convicted of sexually assaulting former production assistant Mimi Haleyi in 2006 and raping Jessica Mann, a onetime aspiring actress, in 2013.He faces up to 25 years in prison on the sexual assault conviction.The jury acquitted Weinstein on two counts of predatory sexual assault, which carried a potential life sentence, and first degree rape of Mann.The case was a milestone for the #MeToo movement that inspired women to go public with misconduct allegations against powerful men.During his trial, Weinstein often appeared feeble, entering the courthouse using a walker. He sometimes leaned on his lead attorney, Donna Rotunno, for support.""He's taken some good acting tips,"" actress Rose McGowan said at the start of the trial on January 6 while staging a protest near the courthouse along with actress Rosanna Arquette and other Weinstein accusers.Weinstein made his mark with critically acclaimed films such as ""The English Patient"" and ""Shakespeare in Love.""More than 80 women, including famous actresses, had accused him of sexual misconduct stretching back decades. He had denied the allegations and said any sexual encounters were consensual.Paul Callan, a former New York prosecutor who is not involved in the case, said Weinstein had strong grounds to argue the verdict should be overturned on appeal because of bias, noting that one of the jurors was the author of a forthcoming book on teenage girls and ""predatory"" older men.During the trial, prosecutors portrayed Weinstein as a serial predator who had manipulated women with promises to open doors in Hollywood, coaxing them to hotel rooms or private apartments and then overpowering and violently attacking them.""The man seated right there was not just a titan in Hollywood, he was a rapist,"" Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Meghan Hast said during opening arguments.Seated at the defence table, Weinstein often appeared impassive, though at times he looked intently at his attorneys when they cross-examined his accusers.During the many weeks of trial, the prosecution methodically elicited graphic testimony from several accusers, including Haleyi, who said Weinstein invited her to his SoHo home after she had worked on one of his television productions.After she arrived, Weinstein backed her into a bedroom, held her down on the bed and forced himself on her orally, yanking out her tampon, Haleyi told jurors.A onetime aspiring actress, Mann said that soon after meeting Weinstein she entered into an ""extremely degrading"" relationship with him that never included intercourse until, she alleged, he raped her in 2013.She described Weinstein as a ""Jekyll and Hyde"" character: He was charming in public but often showed terrifying anger when they were alone, Mann said.At one point, she started sobbing uncontrollably on the stand, prompting the judge to end testimony early for the day.Weinstein was charged with assaulting Haleyi and Mann, but prosecutors bolstered their case by calling several other accusers as witnesses.One of these women, ""Sopranos"" actress Annabella Sciorra , told jurors Weinstein came into her apartment one winter night in 1993 or 1994 and raped her.Though the accusation was too old to be charged as a separate crime, prosecutors offered it to show Weinstein was a repeat sexual offender.Three other women - costume designer Dawn Dunning, model Tarale Wulff and actress Lauren Young - testified that they were enticed into meeting Weinstein for professional reasons and then groped or raped.Testimony of ""prior bad acts"" is generally not allowed in criminal trials, but an exception to the law allowed prosecutors to call these women to show Weinstein had a particular intention or a signature pattern of behavior.Legal experts said the women provided powerful evidence that was difficult for the defence to overcome.Dunning testified that the producer groped her in 2004 and offered her movie roles in exchange for three-way sex with him and his assistant, which she refused.Young, a model and actress, testified that the producer trapped her in a hotel bathroom in 2013, masturbated in front of her while groping her breasts, and told her: ""This is what all the actresses do to make it.""Throughout the case, the defence said regret drove the accusers to take consensual incidents and reframe them as crimes.Weinstein's lawyers zeroed in on friendly messages and ongoing contact between the women and Weinstein.During cross-examination of Haleyi, for example, the defence showed her a message she sent Weinstein signed ""lots of love"" after her alleged attack.Defence lawyers repeatedly suggested that Mann willingly had sex with Weinstein to advance her career.Weinstein never testified in his defence, although he told reporters he had wanted to. One of his lawyers said the case was too weak to warrant putting him on the stand.Weinstein's lawyer Rotunno told jurors during closing arguments that they were ""the last line of defence"" against an ""overzealous"" prosecution and that women were ""responsible"" for the ""choices they make to further their own careers.""Prosecutors pushed back against claims that his accusers were not credible and the notion that they were responsible for the alleged attacks.Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi said it was irrelevant whether they had ongoing contact with Weinstein after the alleged attacks.Illuzzi rejected a defence claim that Mann had a loving relationship with Weinstein, but said it would not matter if she had been ""head over heels in love with him.""""He still wouldn't be allowed to rape her on March 18 of 2013,"" she said.Weinstein still faces sexual assault charges in California, which were announced just hours after his New York rape trial began, and dozens of women have filed civil lawsuits against him."

Thiruvananthapuram: For six years, Kerala was like a home to Goutam Mondal, a 25-year-old construction labourer hailing from Malda in West Bengal. The state gave him an opportunity to earn a decent living and support his family. But on Saturday, one incident changed his perception at least for a night with him on the verge of packing his bags to return home. He was publicly harassed, both physically and verbally, by a man at Vizhinjam who even went on to question his identity and citizenship.However, by next day morning, Mondal got to see the righteous side of the citizens of the state with many of them expressing solidarity with him, both in person and through the social media. As the night passed, a video of the incident went viral on social media prompting police to register a case. By Sunday afternoon, police tracked down and arrested the accused –– a 47-year-old autorickshaw driver named Suresh Kumar alias Kadala Suresh of Mukkola.The incident happened at Mukkola near Vizhinjam around 9.30pm on Saturday. According to witnesses, Kumar’s rickshaw hit Mondal while the former was trying to park his vehicle, driving in reverse gear. Mondal was stepping into a mobile phone recharge shop beside the road when he was hit by the rickshaw.“When Mondal questioned his rash and negligent driving style, the accused slapped him on his face and started verbally abusing him,” said Vizhinjam SHO S B Praveen.However, an onlooker recorded the episode on his mobile phone and shared it on WhatsApp groups. The video that went viral within half-an-hour, reached the police too. Soon, a probe was launched. Though Kumar tried to flee, police tracked him down and arrested him by Sunday afternoon.In the video, Kumar can be seen demanding Mondal’s ID proof documents. He even snatched them when Mondal took them out. However, he returned them before leaving the scene.He was charged with relevant sections of attempt to murder, criminal intimidation, using obscene language, causing hurt and wrongful restraint. He was produced before a court and remanded in judicial custody.Police said that Kumar had another case pending in the station. It pertained to a similar assault on a 22-year-old youth who worked in a mobile phone shop at Mukkola. The incident happened inside the shop. Though a complaint was filed on the same day, police had failed to take any action.Residents in the area said that the accused was a substance addict and had even undergone a rehabilitation programme.Meanwhile, Mondal was overwhelmed by the support he received. He admitted that he planned on booking a rail ticket back to Bengal in the morning itself, after he faced the harassment.“Everywhere there will be at least one person like him (the accused), who are trouble makers,” said Goutam in broken Malayalam, adding that he does not hold any ill-will towards the people here for the actions of one man. Mondal currently resides in a labourers’ camp at Mukkola."

MUMBAI: Archbishop of Mumbai Cardinal Oswald Gracias has told Bombay high court there was no question of intimating the police about the alleged sexual abuse of a minor by a priest in November 2015 as they were already informed by the parents who had registered a complaint.Gracias and two bishops, Dominic Savio Fernandes and John Rodrigues, have filed a petition to quash a Pocso court's order of May 7, 2019 to the police to investigate whether they ""conducted any inquiry and despite having received knowledge did not give information to the police"" under section 19 of the Pocso Act. They also want a recent FIR by the Shivaji Nagar police quashed.While section 19 deals with reporting of sexual offences, section 21 (2) prescribes imprisonment up to a year if a person in charge of an institution fails to report an offence by a subordinate under his control. The priest, Fr Lawrence Johnson (52), is facing trial. In February 2019, the minor's father sought action against the trio.The petition states that the boy's father filed a complaint in respect of ""the alleged incident of November 27, 2015 on November 30, 2015. ""Therefore there was no question of again intimating the concerned police station about the alleged offence because already the police were informed and the police had already taken cognisance by registering an FIR, therefore there is no offence committed by the petitioner no 3 (Cardinal) as alleged by the complainant for non-compliance of section 19 of PocsoAct,'' it adds.The petition informs that the Cardinal directed an inquiry as soon as he received the November 30, 2015 complaint letter and learnt, a day later in Rome, that the FIR was registered. ""Therefore, the present petitioners cannot be held liable for prosecution under section 21 of PocsoAct for non-compliance of section 19."" The petition says the trio is ""innocent"" and ""falsely implicated"" in this case."

NEW DELHI/WASHINGTON: The government rejected the observations on India in the USCIRF annual report, which had accused India of allowing harassment of Muslims and violence against them, saying the US federal government entity’s misrepresentation of India had reached new levels.The report on India was rejected by two of its own commissioners. “Its biased and tendentious comments against India are not new. But on this occasion, its misrepresentation has reached new levels,” MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), which claims to monitor religious freedom around the world, asked the state department to designate 14 nations, including India, as countries of particular concern ( CPC ), alleging that religious minorities were under increasing assault in these nations.However, two of its nine members expressed dissent over USCIRF recommendation to place India in the CPC."

Nagpur: A day after a non-cognizable offence was registered against Congress corporator Bunty Shelke for allegedly thrashing a man, he claimed that the case was politically motivated to malign his image in public.Kotwali police have registered a case of assault against Shelke for thrashing one Monty Mutkare. Shelke narrated his version of the incident during a press conference at Patrakar Bhavan on Thursday.The corporator claimed that Monty is like a younger brother to him and on Tuesday night he was trying to give him ‘brotherly advice’ to not to indulge in anti-social activities. “I have known Monty for several years. I had several times conveyed my concerns about Monty’s drinking habits to his father and the bad company he has fallen into,” said Shelke.Shelke claimed that he had gone to speak to Monty on Tuesday night after returning from a hospital. “Reports in newspapers that I was inebriated are wrong. In fact, I am a teetotaller. Even the CCTV footage at the spot shows that I was only speaking to Monty,” he said.When asked about the allegation that he tried to “manage” the police, Shelke said, “There are 79 cases against me and that clearly shows the cops’ “affection” towards me.” The assault case is politically motivated as some BJP leaders are trying to malign my image, Shelke alleged."

PUNE: Seven standard VIII students of an English medium school in Kondhwa were booked on Monday by the Wanowrie police on charges of rioting and assaulting their classmate on November 22, last year.The assault took place during the recess after a quarrel over the 15-year-old victim’s prompt replies to the teachers’ questions in class the same day.The victim’s father said he had reported the matter to the school’s authorities immediately, but they did not act on his complaint. He then met senior officials at the police commissionerate and then lodged an FIR against the students.He also said that some students in his son’s class do not like that his son replies to questions that teachers ask in the course of their study.The school’s authorities told TOI that the student was not beaten up and the allegations levelled by the father were false and baseless.“During the recess, the seven students cornered the victim and sought an explanation from him about his replies to the teachers’ questions. They told the victim that because of him the teachers scolded them,” the police said.Matters grew heated and a quarrel broke out among them. “In a fit of anger, the students abused the victim, then thrashed and kicked him. The FIR says one of the students pulled out a window curtain rod and attacked him. The other students gagged his mouth with the curtain and then beat him up, injuring him,” the police said.Investigating officer sub-inspector Abhijit Joagdand said they are recording the statement of the doctors treating the student, collecting his injury certificate and recording the statements of teachers and other students.“We will take a call on any action against the students who are 15-year-olds,” Joagdand added.The father said he took his son to three hospitals for treatment after the November 22 attack and filed a complaint with the school’s principal seeking action against the students who beat up his son but no action was taken even after several reminders.“When the school did not give me justice, I filed a complaint plea with the Pune police commissioner. The Wanworie police later called me and recorded my complaint,” he added.The school’s chairman told TOI that they took the boy to a private hospital immediately after he sustained injuries in school.“We inquired into the incident immediately and learned that the student had a fall after he was pushed by his classmates and fell unconscious. The student was not thrashed. We suspended all seven students involved in the incident for six days,” the chairman said.“The students and their parents parents were counselled for three days. We took an undertaking from them that they will not indulge in violent behaviour. We also counselled the injured student and his parents. We took action but I don’t know why the boy’s father has lodged an FIR against the students,” he added."

NEW YORK: Deliberating for a third day, the jury at Harvey Weinstein 's trial continued Thursday to focus a lot of attention on actress Annabella Sciorra 's linchpin allegation that the once-heralded Hollywood mogul raped and sexually assaulted her in the mid-1990s.Jurors were looking at emails that Weinstein sent regarding Sciorra, including ones to the private Israeli spy agency he allegedly enlisted to dig up dirt on would-be accusers as reporters were working on stories about allegations against him in 2017.They remained behind closed doors, deliberating without the flurry of notes requesting to rehear testimony and see pieces of evidence that marked the first two days of deliberations.Sciorra's allegations are too old to be charged on their own because of the statute of limitations in effect at the time. But, because of a quirk in the law on charging someone as a sexual predator, they are key to the most serious charges that jurors are weighing in the closely watched (hash)MeToo case.Weinstein, 67, is charged with five counts stemming from the allegations of Sciorra and two other women — an aspiring actress who says he raped her in March 2013 and a former film and TV production assistant, Mimi Haleyi, who says he forcibly performed oral sex on her in March 2006.Sciorra's account is the basis for two counts of predatory sexual assault , a charge that carries a maximum penalty of life in prison. The charge requires prosecutors to show that a defendant committed a prior rape or other sex crime, but doesn't have the time constraints that would bar Sciorra's allegations from consideration.To convict Weinstein of that charge, jurors must agree on two things: that Weinstein raped or sexually assaulted Sciorra and that he committed one of the other charged offenses.The Associated Press has a policy of not publishing the names of people who allege sexual assault without their consent. It is withholding the name of the rape accuser because it isn't clear whether she wishes to be identified publicly.Weinstein has maintained that any sexual contact was consensual.Sciorra was the first accuser to testify and took the witness stand nearly a month ago, telling jurors how Weinstein barged into her Manhattan apartment and raped and forcibly performed oral sex on her in late 1993 or early 1994. She said the encounter initially left her confused about what had happened.When asked if she thought she had been raped, Sciorra replied: ""I didn't really know.... I don't know because I thought he was a nice person.""Jurors signaled their interest in Sciorra soon after deliberations got underway on Tuesday, sending a note seeking clarity on why Weinstein wasn't charged with other crimes stemming from her allegation. The judge replied that they ""must not speculate as to any other charges that are not before you.""The jury of seven men and five women finished Wednesday's deliberations by revisiting actress Rosie Perez 's testimony about what she says Sciorra told her soon after the alleged assault.Perez said her friend Sciorra had told her at some point in 1993, her voice shaking on the phone, that something had happened to her: ""I think it was rape.""Perez testified that months later, on a phone call from London, Sciorra said Weinstein was harassing her and she was scared.""I said, `He's the one that raped you,""' and they both began crying, Perez testified.""Please go to the police,"" Perez said she told Sciorra.She said Sciorra responded: ""I can't — he'd destroy me.""Weinstein's lawyers have attempted to cast doubt on Sciorra's suggestion that she couldn't deflect Weinstein's advances and felt powerless to hold him accountable.""Annabella is not a shrinking violet,"" defense lawyer Donna Rotunno told jurors in closing arguments."

Kolkata: The husband of a young woman, who died hours after she gave birth to a healthy boy, assaulted the gynaecologist who had delivered the baby at CMRI Hospital on Thursday morning, sparking widespread anger in the medical fraternity, with doctors seeking strict punishment for the accused.Rinki Bhattacharya, 30, was admitted to the hospital on Wednesday, where ob-gyn Basab Mukherjee conducted a C-section to deliver a boy in the morning. Family members said the mother had appeared quite healthy when they saw her during the evening visiting hour. But the Baguiati resident developed severe respiratory distress around 3am on Thursday and died of a cardiac arrest soon after. The family demanded an explanation from the doctor. Mukherjee was in the process of explaining the possible cause of her death, when her husband, Tapen Bhattacharya, lashed out and slapped him on the left cheek. The impact of the blow sent the doctor reeling. Uniformed policemen were present when the assault , captured on CCTV cameras, took place.Coming barely eight months after the vicious mob assault at NRS Medical College and Hospital on two junior doctors, the single slap on Thursday resounded far widely than just in the corridors of CMRI. News of the assault sent ripples through the medical fraternity. The NRS incident led to protracted protests and a government assurance on a clampdown on such attacks. The CMRI assault has again touched a raw nerve.Rinki had been under Mukherjee’s care since she became pregnant. Accordingly, she was admitted to CMRI, with which the doctor is attached. The baby was delivered a little after 10am on Wednesday. The rest of the day was normal. According to hospital authorities, she suddenly complained of severe respiratory distress around 3am on Thursday and died of a cardiac arrest despite critical care support.Her relatives, who arrived early on Thursday, were initially stunned to learn of the death and began asking questions about what had happened to Rinki, since she was apparently in perfect health just a few hours ago. When the RMO’s explanations failed to satisfy them, the message was conveyed to Mukherjee, who volunteered to speak to the family. “The doctor arrived at the hospital earlier than usual when he learnt that the family wanted an explanation. He said he would try to explain what happened,” said a hospital source.The doctor then entered the patients’ counselling room and began speaking to a dozen-odd relatives of the deceased. As a precautionary measure, the hospital also called in the police, and two constables were present in the room. “The doctor was explaining the possible causes of death. When the relatives failed to see reason, he suggested an autopsy to determine the cause. It was at this point that the husband sprang up from a chair, leapt towards the doctor and slapped him on the face. The suddenness of the attack caught both the cops and the hospital security personnel unawares,” said a hospital staff.According to the family, Tapen turned furious at what he felt was “medical jargon”, instead of explaining in “simple terms” what had happened. “The doctor was trying to camouflage medical negligence with medical terms that none of us could understand,” alleged a family member. Tapen later said he was distraught and beyond himself on learning of the shocking loss. “How would anybody else have reacted under this circumstance?” Family members said Tapen later expressed remorse.The couple had got married two years ago, and this was their first child. According to relatives, their association with Mukherjee’s family goes way back. Basudeb Mukherjee, his father, is also a gynaecologist and had helped deliver several newborns in the family, they said. “The death was unfortunate. However, physical violence on a doctor is unacceptable and will not be endured by the hospital,” read a statement by the hospital, which lodged a assault complaint with Alipore PS. Dr Mukherjee, too, has lodged an assault complaint with the cops."

A day after issuing a statement that said, ‘no physical abuse was meted out to the guest named Mr. Soumyadeep Sikdar ’, Acropolis Mall authorities have decided to probe the matter further. On Wednesday night, they posted another statement on social media, which said: ‘We have been conducting a departmental enquiry on the incident’. Following CT ’s report on the incident, the mall on Thursday even reached out to the musician, who had alleged physical assault by the mall’s security personnel following an altercation over being denied a socket to charge his phone at the food court.“We invited Soumyadeep to our mall, but he said he was out of the city. So, we reached out to him on the phone. We have assured him that an enquiry into the matter is being conducted. We’ve never faced any such incident in the past and will surely take action against the offender,” an Acropolis Mall spokesperson told CT.Confirming that he received a call from the mall, Soumyadeep said, “They have apologised and assured me that if any bit of my claim is found to be true, the authorities will take action. The woman on the phone also promised that the result of the enquiry will be emailed to me. I explained my ordeal to her.” Though the Sufi singer is now looking for closure, he is still bemused by the silent spectators of the incident.No one from the mall has any right to beat up visitors even if the said person has done something wrong. I’m shocked that no one came forward to help me. This could have happened with one of them too. However, I want the matter to end once those guilty are punished. I hope no one else has to face the treatment that was meted out to me — not even those who remained silent spectators when I was being heckled,” Soumyadeep said.Meanwhile, a separate statement was emailed to CT on Thursday by the mall authorities to clarify their stance. “Considering the outcome we will definitely take necessary steps against the staff, if we find them guilty. There can be individual acts which surely does not define our intention to run the mall ! There are daily briefings which take place to ensure such incidents doesn't occur. (In spite of these precautions it is quite unfortunate that such an incident occurred at our mall.) (sic),” read their statement."

NEW DELHI/WASHINGTON: The government rejected the observations on India in the USCIRF annual report, which had accused India of allowing harassment of Muslims and violence against them, saying the US federal government entity’s misrepresentation of India had reached new levels.The report on India was rejected by two of its own commissioners. “Its biased and tendentious comments against India are not new. But on this occasion, its misrepresentation has reached new levels,” MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), which claims to monitor religious freedom around the world, asked the state department to designate 14 nations, including India, as countries of particular concern ( CPC ), alleging that religious minorities were under increasing assault in these nations.However, two of its nine members expressed dissent over USCIRF recommendation to place India in the CPC."

HYDERABAD: A two-year-old girl who was kidnapped at Thondupally was reunited with her family within two hours on Thursday. Police arrested an autorickshaw driver, S Sandeep, for allegedly kidnapping the toddler.At 10.20am on Thursday, Sonu Kumar, a worker at a brick kiln in Thondupally, lodged a complaint with the Shamshabad police stating that his daughter, Simpi, went missing while playing in front of the brick kiln around 9.30am.During preliminary probe, police found that the girl was abducted by an autorickshaw driver. “A ragpicker from Bihar, who was collecting bottles near the brick kiln, saw the girl, who was crying on the road, being taken away by an autorickshaw driver,” ACP, Shamshabad S Ashok Kumar Goud said.Police teams launched a manhunt to nab the offender and obtained the autorickshaw’s registration number after analysing CCTV footage.Using the vehicle registration details, police contacted the owner of the autorickshaw, who informed them that one S Sandeep (35) from Maharashtra, was riding the three-wheeler. The autorickshaw owner then took police to Sandeep’s house in Rallaguda area of Shamshabad.“We found the girl asleep inside Sandeep’s hut. Sandeep tried to fool us by saying that he took the girl home as she was alone on the road. He should have informed police or locals. We have arrested Sandeep and the girl has been handed over to her mother,” the ACP said. “Sandeep is married, but they have no children,” police said."

BHOPAL: A Class 12 student in MP’s Morena district cooked up a bizarre plan to skip his board exams that started on Monday. He allegedly kidnapped his three-year-old nephew from a family function and left a note warning the family “not to allow him to take the exams”.The toddler spent all night tied up in a field, weeping and helpless to defend himself if any animal came by. It’s a miracle he was unhurt when police rescued him on Monday morning.The accused, 18-year-old Ranveer, did get his wish, though. Now that he is in custody, he probably won’t be able to give his exam.Ranveer’s family were visiting a relative at Tudila village in Jaura region of the district — about 450km north of Bhopal — on Sunday. He was supposed to write his Hindi board paper on Monday. Morena SP Asit Yadav told TOI that police got a call on Dial 100 at 3.10am on Monday that a 3-year-old child had been kidnapped from Tudila. “The family found a letter, which said that the accused — who is a relative of the kidnapped child — should not be allowed to appear in board examinations,” Yadav added.Based on the letter, police searched Ranveer’s room in neighbouring Pipraua village. “Some notebooks were found, where the handwriting was found to match with that of the letter. On suspicion, we questioned the accused. He admitted that he had kidnapped his cousin’s son and left him tied up in a farm at around 9pm on Sunday,” Yadav said, adding: “Ranveer wanted to avoid giving the examinations at any cost. He thought that in all this commotion he will not be allowed to appear for the board exam.”The toddler was weeping when he was rescued. “Ranveer claimed that he intended to bring the kid back after he was excused from the examination,” Yadav said. There was initially some confusion over whether the accused is a juvenile. “He is not a minor,” the SP confirmed.

PATNA: Police on late Monday night arrested one Mishal Ranjan (22) for his alleged involvement in the kidnapping of a youth at gunpoint from Patliputra roundabout.

MUMBAI: For 19 seafarers from crude oil tanker Nave Constellation, bringing in New Year with their families was a big deal. Gun-toting pirates had kidnapped the group, 18 of them Indians, in Nigeria last month and had forced them to camp near a crocodile-infested swamp with minimal food. Recounting details crew members said they may never be able to put the harrowing experience behind them.The ship set sail from Singapore on October 27 with 26 crew members. They were to load cargo in Nigeria and head back to India. Armed securitymen had been hired to escort the vessel after it left the Bonny Offshore Terminal as the Gulf of Guinea is a high-risk area. But the securitymen never arrived and the vessel departed without them on December 3.""It was dark when six gun-toting pirates climbed onto the ship with ladders. They pushed the Captain and the chief officer to the floor,"" said a crew member. This was their fifth time kidnapping a crew, the pirates said. The pirates looted the vault in the Captain's cabin and forced all 26 crew to climb down the drainage pipes with them to reach the main deck. Seven crew were left on the ship while the rest including a woman were bundled into the pirates' boat.""We sailed for 12 hours till we reached a river. Suddenly, the pirates made us duck in their boat and threw a tarpaulin over our heads. We travelled for another two hours till we could hear the beating of drums. We had arrived by a camp near a swamp with 40 armed pirates. After walking through muck, we were made to sit on the bare ground. We ate nothing that day,"" said a crew member.The next day, the hostages were moved into makeshift sheds. Food consisted of one bowl of rice a day or some noodles. An armed pirate would escort hostages whenever they went to relieve themselves in the open.""On the second day of the abduction, there was sound of gunfire and we were instructed to run. A rival gang of pirates had attacked the camp, wanting to 'steal' us. There were explosions all around and the commander who had kidnapped us was killed. After that, we moved locations every night, fearing more attacks. On the eleventh day of our abduction we were moved to a ""safe spot"", again near the river where we stayed till the end,"" said the crew member. The pirates used satellite phones for communication.The hostages would spend the days chatting in hushed tones. ""Everyone was terrified, but we tried to take our minds off things by recounting old shipping stories. We did not know if we would see our families,"" said a crew member. On the eighteenth day, the hostages were taken out by boat to be released. But the pirates found out that a representative of the ship management company who was supposed to bring the ransom had been robbed by another gang. The hostages had to stay on the same boat till the next day when the ship management and the pirates worked out a deal.""We were dropped a little away from the shore at Port Harcourt where armed military men escorted us to a hotel by bus. Three of us had contracted malaria. After medical treatment and sorting out procedures with the Nigerian government authorities, we finally flew out of the country on December 28,"" said a member of the crew."

KOLKATA: Two days after an ambulance ran over 52-year-old Gopal Pramanick, seconds after the occupants of the vehicle allegedly tried to kidnap his daughter-in-law Priyanka Pramanick (28), the police claimed to have found several inconsistencies in her statement. After studying a CCTV footage , a senior police officer said: “If the evidence does not add up during the probe, we will lodge an FIR against the complainant.”The cops, however, have started a case under IPC sections 357 (assault or criminal force in attempt wrongfully to confine a person) and 341 (wrongful restraint) along with Section 34, based on the woman’s complaint. This is besides the case under IPC section pertaining to culpable homicide not amounting to murder, which had already been registered.According to police, not only did she conceal the fact that another relative was walking right next to her and her three-year-old daughter, she had also failed to explain why she failed to lodge her complaint immediately after the accident. The CCTV footage runs for 74 seconds from 11.53pm on Tuesday. After the first 32 seconds, Priyanka is seen walking — her daughter on her right and her aunt (mami-shasuri) Rita Pramanik her left — along the left side of the road.A couple of steps behind, Gopal is seen following them. He is actually spotted on the road. Four more relatives — in batches of two each — are seen moving towards their home.The accident took place between 55 and 59 seconds in the 74-second footage and by the 60th second the ambulance is visible with the family members running behind it. “How is it that everything took place in seconds? How can someone stop, converse and then pick up speed that can kill a person by dragging him along?” questioned an IPs officer at Lalbazar.Lalbazar’s response came barely hours after residents of Christopher Road in Tangra took to the road and blocked it claiming the police was deliberately trying to pass off a serious crime against woman and a culpable homicide leading to the death of a 52-year-old man as a mere accident.The protestors blocked GK Road using drums and carried currency notes. “We want to bribe the cops, just as a bribe has let them change the course of this case. May be once we bribe them, they will bring out the truth,” claimed Tapan Pramanick, a relative of the victim."

BHOPAL: A band of hooligans terrorised a family travelling in a jeep in Misrod on Sunday night, allegedly passed lewd remarks at a woman , and abducted one of her brothers when they protested.The kidnap victim was held hostage in a flat and beaten before being rescued by police. Such brazen hooliganism in a residential locality of the state capital has come as a shock to Bhopalis. All the accused are linked to sand business.The attackers — there were apparently six of them — were in an SUV when they spotted the girl travelling with four of her brothers in an open jeep and made obscene remarks at her. When her brothers objected, they waylaid the family, dragged them out, vandalised the jeep and forcibly took one of the brothers — a 23-year-old — with them. He was rescued after his family informed police.Investigation officer SI Suresh Mishra said that the kidnapped youth works with an automobile dealership firm. On Sunday, around 8.30pm, the brothers and their sister were returning home in an open jeep after attending a wedding in Mandideep. Near Mandideep railway station bridge, the goons in a car passed obscene comments at the girl. The family protested, but the ruffians blocked the jeep with their car, and mocked them, saying the brothers didn’t dare touch them.In a while, some accomplices of the cat-callers arrived in another car and started hurling abuses at the victims. Realising that he and his family were outnumbered, the 23-year-old man sped up and reported the matter to Mandideep police.When they were returning home, the family was waylaid by the hoodlums who used both cars to block their jeep. Six-seven people started hurling abuses at them, smashed the jeep’s windscreen and lights with sticks.The accused then forced the victim’s brothers and sister off their vehicle and abducted the 23-year-old. They took him to their flat in Misrod, where they allegedly locked him in a room and assaulted him. One of the accused allegedly told the victim that he is Abhilash Maran.SI said that police received the information about the incident from victim’s brothers around 12.30am. A Dial-100 team sped to the spot but the accused fled on hearing the police siren. They left their two cars on the spot.Police seized the vehicles and registered a case against the accused . Mishra said that Abhilash stays in a village near Gyarah Meel Square and is a sand trader. Most of the other accused are also sand traders. Cops have detained three suspects, including Abhilash’s cousin Akash Maran and Shubham Dangi. Misrod police has registered a case against the accused on charges of abduction, assault and issuing threats.The prime accused is still on the run. Cops say that the accused and the complainants had a tussle over some trivial issue around a week back too."

It’s the second rape in the state capital in lockdown period.What’s equally shocking, the car carrying her must have passed through police checkpoints in the 6-8km between JP Hospital and Govindpura — including Board Office Square -- but they were not stopped anywhere.The teenager and a friend were walking towards JP Hospital when she was abducted by two men from near the hospital gates around 7.30pm on April 18, says her complaint. One of them raped her. After three hours of the nightmare, the duo left her near Mayur Park and threatened to kill her if she spoke to anyone about the rape.Terrified and traumatised, she kept quiet. The next day, a friend counselled her and advised her to go to police. She filed a complaint at her local police station, which recorded a zero FIR and transferred it to Habibganj police station, which has jurisdiction of the area around the hospital.ASI Shashi Choubey said the girl has named the duo as Shafiq Khan, 24, and his friend Abid Khan. ASP (Zone-1) Rajat Saklecha said they have registered a case under POCSO Act.The survivor says that on reaching a deserted area of BHEL township, Shafiq left Abid in the car and dragged her to an open ground where he raped her.

PATNA: The Kaimur police on Monday arrested a CRPF jawan for faking his kidnapping to get ransom from his father.The constable, Rajdev Kumar Gupta, was recovered from a train between Patna and Bhabhua in Kaimur on Monday, six days after his alleged kidnapping by unknown criminals from Buxar-Thakura road under the Noan police station area of the district on January 27.The victim’s wife, Nandini Kumari, had apprehended the involvement of Gupta’s stepbrother, who was detained by police. The suspect, however, denied his involvement in the kidnapping of Gupta, who was posted in Andhra Pradesh.Nandini had told the investigating officers that her husband was kidnapped for ransom as her father-in-law had received Rs 30 lakh after selling some ancestral land in the village recently. The kidnappers had allegedly demanded Rs 18 lakh as ransom for his release.Kaimur SP Dilnawaz Ahmad said, “Our investigation revealed that the CRPF jawan had been in constant touch with his wife ever since the kidnapping was reported to police. He, however, kept moving from one place to another and talked to his wife from different phone numbers.”On Monday, when the location of Gupta’s cellphone was traced near Mohania in Kaimur, police rushed to the place and recovered him.“During investigation, it came to light that a sum of Rs 6 lakh was transferred to Gupta’s bank account from his father’s to pay the ransom money to the alleged kidnappers. In fact, Gupta had taken a Rs10 lakh loan and had enacted the drama of his false kidnapping to return the money,” the SP said.The role of Gupta also came under the scanner after the Andhra police disclosed that the CRPF jawan had been missing from duty since December 3 last year. The officials of the central force apprehended that he might have been kidnapped by the Left extremists operating in the region and subsequently a missing complaint was lodged.Gupta, who is a native of Buxar district , was produced before a court at Bhabhua, which later remanded him to judicial custody for 14 days."

LUCKNOW: The 21-year-old missing BSc student whose unrecognizable, badly-burnt body was found on Saturday evening from Harchandpur in Rae Bareli, three kilometres away from her college and identified on Sunday, had been kidnapped for forced marriage and set ablaze for resisting, alleged her father in his complaint to police on Monday.The family members and relatives staged a protest by keeping her corpse on main road in Bachhrawan. The girl, a resident of Bachhrawan, had gone to college on Saturday, but her body was recovered from thickets in Harchandpur area of Lucknow-Allahabad highway.The girl’s father has accused one Atul Gupta (25), saying he had proposed to his daughter few days ago while she was returning from college. “Despite my daughter’s clear refusal, Atul misbehaved with her on many occasions, after which we took up the matter with his family, but 15 days ago he threatened her with dire consequences if she didn’t marry him,” he alleged.Acting on the complaint, Rae Bareli police lodged an FIR against Atul Gupta on charges of murder, concealing evidence, criminal intimidation, and causing hurt. SP, Rae Bareli, Swapnil Mamgain told TOI, “Atul, a distant relative of the girl, has been nabbed but is denying charges. He runs a cloth store in Shivratanganj, Amethi. We have detained four other persons also and are questioning them.”“The post-mortem report of victim rules out rape and mentions burns as the cause of death. We will recreate the crime scene to ascertain the sequence of events since kidnapping a 21-year-old and setting her afire cannot be done by one man,” Mamgain said.A source privy to probe, however, said the victim had told a friend to carry her bag home and tell her parents that she had been kidnapped, but they did not report it to police and complained a day later."

PATNA: A 13-year-old girl from Katihar , who was kidnapped while returning home from school more than a month ago, was rescued from Siliguri in West Bengal on Monday by her parents with the help of Bihar Police “The girl was kidnapped by Lakhman Paswan and his associates in the last week of November while she was returning from her school,” Katihar’s Sahayak police station SHO Rajesh Kumar said, adding, “Paswan took her to Siliguri where he works at a tea manufacturing company and raped her.”In her police complaint, the girl alleged that she was raped by Paswan, a father of three, in his rented accommodation soon after they landed at Siliguri. When she complained to his wife Munni Devi, she allegedly threatened her and told her to follow her husband’s diktat.According to the complaint, the minor overheard a conversation between Paswan and his wife about selling the minor to pimp in a red light area. Frightened, she narrated her tale to a sympathetic neighbour.“The neighbour took pity on her and somehow contacted her parents in Katihar over phone and disclosed about the place where she was held captive,” said an investigating officer, quoting the victim.Paswan (40) and his wife Muni Devi (35) have been booked under Section 366A of IPC and POCSO Act 2012. “Other sections will be added after receipt of the victim’s medical report,” the SHO added.Katihar SP Vikas Kumar said, “The girl comes from a poor family and her neighbour took advantage of the family’s economic condition. The couple’s links with those involved in human trafficking in Siliguri are being verified. Our first priority was to get the victim released safe and sound.”Since the police were made aware that Paswan was trying to sell her off, the Katihar police exerted pressure on his relatives in Katihar. “Going to Siliguri would have taken time so we exerted pressure on Lakshman’s relatives in Katihar to hand over the girl to her parents. And the girl was let off near the ‘hawai adda’ under the Katihar Sahayak police station on Monday evening from where she was brought to the police station,” said a police officer.“We will now send a police team to Siliguri to trace the place where the girl was kept in illegal confinement and subjected to sexual abuse. A woman police officer has been entrusted with the task of counselling the victim on a regular basis,” the SP said.The minor was produced at the Katihar civil court on Tuesday and sent to the local sadar hospital for medical examination. The medical report is awaited.Though the Sahayak SHO denied that any missing complaint was lodged, the girl’s father claimed that he had filed a complaint petition to the local police but nobody cared. “Thane wale bole ki pata lagao (cops asked me to search her myself),” the girl’s father said."

PATNA: After four days of kidnapping for ransom of Rs10 lakh, Patna police with the help of its Munger counterparts rescued betel leaf trader Deepak Kumar (24) and arrested three kidnappers from Chorgaon village under Asarganj police station area in the wee hours of Saturday.The police laid a trap and sent his family members to the kidnappers’ desired location in the name of handing them over the ransom money. Deepak lives with his family at New Karbighaiya under Jakkanpur police station area in state capital and owns a betel leaf shop near Patna Junction. He was kidnapped from Mithapur bus stand in a SUV on January 7 morning.Those arrested were identified as Sonu Kumar, Raja Kumar and Ashish Kumar. Sonu and Raja belong to Sangrampur village under Tarapur police station area in Munger district while Ashish is a native of Rampur in Banka district. Sonu was the mastermind of Deepak’s kidnapping.Police said the kidnappers were to kill Deepak for non-payment of ransom money or on slightest possibility of being caught.The victim told TOI that he was kept inside a room with no window. “Sonu had threatened to chop me off into pieces and bury somewhere in the jungle after pouring salt so that none could ever trace me,” he said.Deepak said Sonu had befriended him two months back at his shop. “After several days, he offered me a job at Bihta and said I can also run my shop. I was required to work for four hours on Rs22,000 monthly remuneration,” he said.Deepak said one day Sonu took him to a person whom he identified as his manager to win confidence. “On January 7, Sonu asked me accompany him to Fatuha in a SUV. Before getting inside the vehicle, he offered me an aerated drink which was spiked. I woke up disoriented inside a dark room with no window,” he said.Jakkanpur police station SHO Mukesh Kumar Verma said kidnappers had used Deepak’s cellphone to make the ransom call to his family members due to which police initially had not been able to trace his location. “Deepak’s family members were directed not to leave the spot fixed for ransom delivery while police kept surveillance on them from Friday night. Once kidnappers got assured that there was no policeman, they returned and changed the time for ransom delivery to Saturday morning,” he said.Verma said then police raided a house at Chorgaon and recovered Deepak. “Sonu told police that he was prepared to kill Deepak. Police suspect he is involved in several criminal cases about which details are being gathered,” he added."

SURAT: Mahesh Savani , a top realtor and owner of many educational institutes in the city, was booked by police at Umra police station for alleged extortion and kidnapping of a builder on Saturday.The accused, who has attained fame for organizing mass marriages of orphan girls for around a decade, allegedly kidnapped Gautam Patel 65 , from his house and demanded Rs19 crore for his release.Police booked Savani, his aide Gopal and four others for extortion and kidnapping under Indian Penal Code on Patel’s complaint. Patel alleged that he was in his house at Parl Point when Gopal and four persons came in a car and asked him to go with them.Patel refused after which Savani arrived at the spot and forcibly took the complainant in his car to his office in Vesu and demanded Rs19 crore from him. The complainant was also slapped by the accused.“Savani threatened me that he has contacts at high-level and can put me in trouble if the money was not paid to him. I don’t deny that I had not borrowed money from him but the way he tried to pressurize me is wrong,” said Patel, who recently returned from the US for his son’s marriage.Patel and his partner Tarun Rawal, a builder who died a few years ago, had borrowed money from Savani in 2009-10. Of the total money borrowed, Patel is supposed to repay Rs3 crore to the accused. “Due to heavy loss in business I couldn’t repay the money in time. Hence I gave 60 per cent share in a plot of land to Savani. He couldn’t recover his money because there is a legal dispute over the land and thus the former is harassing me. I am not running away or denying the unpaid loan,” Patel said.CCTV footages at the residence of Patel show Savani and other accused taking him along with them. Police will be recovering these footages as a part of their investigation in the case.Police visited office of Savani where Patel was taken. “The staffers at Savani’s office claim that their recorder was not working properly. We will gather strong evidences before taking action against the accused,” said a police officer at Umra police station."

PATNA: One Amit Kumar (25) was abducted by some people travelling in an SUV when he was on way to Jandaha market in Vaishali district along with his father to meet a doctor on his motorbike on March 24. The father-son duo was taken to Baruna Rasalpur village in neighbouring Samastipur district where Amit, a quack, was forced to marry a girl at gunpoint.The matter came to light after Amit’s father, Musafir Rai, somehow managed to escape from the clutches of the abductors and reported the incident to the Jandaha police in Vaishali district on Friday.Police rescued Amit from Samastipur late on Friday evening. On Saturday, Amit recorded his statement in a court at Hajipur under Section 164 of CrPC. The court later allowed him to go to his native village Naurangpur under the Mahnar police station in Vaishali district.On Friday, a video of the ‘pakadua vivah’ also went viral on social media. In the video, Amit can be heard crying at the top of his voice for help. However, his cries went on deaf ears.The video showed a group of youths jostling with Amit and exerting pressure on him to follow the marriage rituals. Even the priest was pressured to complete the process as early as possible.According to the viral video, the authenticity of which TOI doesn’t confirm, an elderly man, who Amit called ‘chacha’ (uncle), seems to be aware of the whole kidnapping drama. “Had you (chacha) told me about this (marriage), I would have accepted it without demanding any dowry. But the way it is happening is not right,” Amit is heard saying in the video.SHO of Jandaha police station Ajay Kumar said five people, including Vinod Rai and Nawal Rai, have been made accused in the FIR lodged by the victim’s father, an affluent farmer. “The girl is staying with her family. Further action will be taken on the basis of the court’s directive,” the SHO added.According to the FIR, five people travelling in an SUV intercepted Amit near the primary health centre at Jandaha, forced him and his father to sit in the moving vehicle and took them to Baruna Rasalpur village under Halai police outpost in Samastiur district for marriage.‘Pakadua vivah’ is quite common in districts like Vaishali, Samastipur, Begusarai, Lakhisarai, Khagaria, Nawada, Patna and Sheikhpura. Some cases have also been reported from Gaya and Jamui districts. “The disconcerting trend is a matter of concern,” said Sanjay Singh, a social activist.According to an official data, altogether 4,488 people were abducted in the state for marriage in 2019."

While scouting for target, they zeroed in on Pujari. To the kidnappers, Pujari’s fair complexion and western Odisha accent may have made him a perfect candidate, said the police, who felt they must have thought he was rich.Identifiying themselves as policemen, they caught hold of Pujari and accused him of being involved in ganja trade. “Despite Pujari’s denial, they made him alight from the train at Lada railway station,” said SP (Rayagada), Sarvana Vivek M. The incident took place at around 7.30 pm. being a small station, there was hardly any crowd.There, the five were joined by six more men who took Pujari to a mango orchard on the outskirts of Rayagada town.

They also threatened to kill Pujari if his family failed to pay the ransom or informed the police, the SP said.But Pujari’s father approached the Rayagada SP and sought his help. Sarvana formed a special team to trace the youth and the kidnappers. During investigation, the police managed to locate the place from the mobile phone that was used to make the ransom call to Pujari’s father. It led them to the hideout on the outskirts of Rayagada. Seeing the police, five of the kidnappers fled.

NEW DELHI: In a bizarre turn of events, a man kidnapped three children and kept them in a room in Haryana to take revenge on Delhi Police. Cops had earlier held him under preventive custody from Sarita Vihar. While the family members were frantically looking for the children, the man called them posing as a police officer. He asked them to reach a police station, and take the children into their custody. He even gave a hint that they should bring bribe money with them.The family reached the police station, but could not find the children. They accused the cops of corruption. Subsequently, the number from which the accused was making the calls was traced and the children were rescued. The caller was arrested on abduction charges.A police official said that the accused, Bimal Kumar, used to work as marketing head at an NGO called Anti-Corruption Crime Control Force. The three girls, aged 17, 15 and 11, used to stay with their uncle and aunt at a colony near Sarita Vihar after their parents had died a few years ago. On Thursday, the accused found the siblings at a park and lured them to accompany him so that he could ‘help them get a share of their ancestral property’. He told them that their uncle was trying to usurp that property. The girls did not realise Kumar’s nefarious intention and followed him to a house in Faridabad , where the latter locked them up.Meanwhile, the family started looking for the children in the locality. Kumar called them from an unknown number and asked them to reach the Kalindi Kunj police station. Soon, they got another call from him. This time he told the family members that a senior officer had sold the children to an NGO. He then asked them to transfer Rs 12,000 immediately to an account number to facilitate the release.When the call came from one of the kidnapped girls, who claimed that they were left stranded on a road near Badarpur, the family members immediately reached the police station and met the senior officers.“We registered a case and traced the mobile number from which the calls were made. We managed to nab Bimal on Saturday. Initially, he feigned ignorance about the entire incident, but on sustained interrogation, he confessed to the crime,” said Chinmoy Biswal, DCP, south-east. Kidnapped children were rescued from the house in Faridabad.During interrogation, Kumar claimed that he had planned the kidnapping to defame Delhi Police for detaining him in a petty case. He even named a few cops who had detained him. He also tried to leverage the situation by forcing the victim’s uncle to write off a part of his property in the name of children, which Kumar planned to usurp later. The mobile phone used by the accused has been recovered."

MUMBAI: Five men who failed to get bail for four-and-a-half years for kidnapping a teen from Dharavi in 2014 were sentenced to life imprisonment by the sessions court on Friday. Irfan Khan Kureshi (46), Iliyas Khan (44), Wahid Jogi (30), Azad Mevu Khan (29) and Kasam Mevu Khan (29), from Haryana, were nabbed by a Mumbai crime branch team when they arrived in Rajasthan to collect Rs 5 lakh ransom money from the victim Pravin Gupta’s elder brother Pankaj, who was 19 then.The investigating team submitted 315-page charge-sheet and 14 witnesses were provided police security so that they do not turn hostile. Deputy commissioner of police (crime branch) Dilip Sawant said it was a big achievement as many factors helped get the conviction in the shortest time. Senior inspector Ashok Khot (crime branch unit V) supervised the case and attended all court hearings, said Sawant.Pankaj, a shoe shop salesman, got a call from Rahul from Haryana on July 22, 2014, stating that they were looking for a salesman to sell gold in Mumbai, for which he would be paid a good salary and high commission. Pankaj received another call on July 25, asking for someone who can help grow their gold business. Pankaj sent his brother to Faridabad, where the gang kidnapped him on August 6.A case was registered on August 6, 2018, with Shahu Nagar police station after Pankaj received the call demanding Rs 5 lakh, failing which his brother’s life would be in danger. ACP Netaji Bopale supervised a team of inspector Sadanand Rane, assistant inspector Sampatrao Raut, sub-inspector Mahesh Bandgar and constable Prashant Vengulekar, and nabbed the accused on August 9, 2018 from Bharatpur.Khot said initially the accused were not ready to show the victim and sent two men on a bike to collect the money. When Pankaj did not agree to give the money, three other men came in car with the victim, when the five were caught.The accused have been booked under Indian Penal Code sections 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy), 342 (wrongful restraint), 364 (A) (kidnapping for ransom) and 387 (putting person in fear of death or of grievous hurt, to commit extortion).IPS officer-turned-lawyer Y P Singh said kidnapping with ransom was a serious offence and the conviction was a positive approach."

PATNA: Crime and policing go hand in hand in the state these days. This seems true if the arrest of three police constables from Vaishali district on Sunday in connection with a kidnapping case is taken into account.Anil Kumar Manjhi, Anil Kumar Pandey and Himanshu Raj — all constables, who patrolled different lanes and bylanes of the district headquarters town in Hajipur, were arrested for their involvement in the kidnapping of one Shivpujan Singh on January 29.Besides, the three cops, a home guard jawan, Monu Kumar, and three criminals were also arrested. After Shivpujan’s kidnappers demanded Rs 1 lakh as ransom from his family, his wife, Khushboo Kumari, lodged a case with the Hajipur sadar police station on January 29.Vaishali SP Gaurav Mangla said, “We not only rescued the captive from the clutches of his kidnappers, but also exposed the police-criminal nexus. We recovered the service revolver of constable, Manjhi, from the house of one of the kidnappers, Sujeet Kumar alias Santu, in Katra locality under the Hajipur town police station area.”The SP added, “The three erring cops were immediately put under suspension and departmental proceedings initiated against them while the contract of service of arrested home guard jawan was terminated.”The arrested cops’ accomplices were identified as Neeraj Kumar, Amit Kumar and Sujeet Kumar, all residents of Vaishali district. While Manjhi and Pandey belong to Saran district, Raj is a native of Bhojpur district.If sources are to be believed this is not an isolated case. Police personnel have been accused of kidnapping people and plotting the murder of someone or bank robberies on earlier occasions.Constable Sanjeev Singh alias Pappu Singh of Saran district, for instance, was arrested on the charges of hatching the conspiracy of at least 12 robberies in banks. He was also involved in the loot of Rs 1.25 crore from a cash van in Saran district in 2013 and dismissed from service. He was earlier deputed as the bodyguard of a DSP-rank officer at Biharsharif in Nalanda district.Similarly, Amresh Sharma, a constable posted in Begusarai district, was arrested and sent to jail on the charges of plotting the murder of a woman, Sarita Devi, and and her daughter, Monika, at a village in Jehanabad district in 2015.The discerning trend has, however, embarrassed the top police officials. Additional director general of police (headquarters) Jitendra Kumar said, “Every department has some black sheep and ours is no exception. What is important is that they are getting punished for the offence.” Bihar Police Association (BPA) president Mritunjay Kumar Singh also admitted that some men in uniform were involved in unlawful activities. “But it does not mean that the entire department is to be blamed and castigated,” he added."

PANAJI: The high court has upheld the life imprisonment and fine imposed by a trial court on two accused for kidnapping and abusing a 11-year-old boy with learning disabilities and demanding a ransom of Rs 20 lakh in 2011.The two accused were sentenced to life imprisonment and fined Rs 1 lakh each in 2017. They appealed to the high court against the conviction in 2018. The court found that the boy’s testimony, with details of the events that transpired, inspired confidence and was sufficient to bring home the charges against the two.The court noted that additional public prosecutor Pravin Faldessai proved the case beyond reasonable doubt.The case pertains to 2011, when the two men entered into a conspiracy and kidnapped the minor boy with learning difficulties in the afternoon from outside the gate of his school. They then called his father and uncle demanding a ransom of Rs 20 lakh, failing which they threatened to kill the boy. They then drove the boy away in a van, before he was rescued by police.Underscoring the need to maintain the privacy of the victim, the court directed the registry to transmit all the records back to the children’s court so that the boy’s identity, which appears in various records, be protected.The court found that in several places, there was reference to the victim’s name. “This is to be avoided at all costs,” the division bench comprising justices Mahesh Sonak and M S Jawalkar stated in their judgment on Friday.They added that the Goa Children’s Act, 2003, which deals with the procedure before the children’s court, specifically provides that the children’s court abides by the principle of right to privacy and confidentiality of the minor child, and that these be protected by all means and through all stages of the proceedings.“Therefore, we direct that the name of the minor child in the records shall be masked, no doubt, by maintaining the records regarding the identity of the minor child in sealed cover,” the high court stated."

NEW DELHI: Trusting an unknown woman caller who posed herself as a watch seller proved dear to a 39-year-old executive of a watch firm. The woman via a phone call offered him to check samples of new watches. A meeting was scheduled for him to see the designs of new watches. But he had little idea that it will all later turn out to be a kidnapping trap The incident came to fore on Tuesday when the victim, Mukesh, got admitted in a private hospital after being thrashed and gagged by the robbers. Mukesh, who works with a watch manufacturing firm, told cops that he was getting phone calls from an unknown number for the past few days. The woman caller introduced herself as a potential client, who had some new designs of watches to offer.“On Monday, Mukesh again got a phone call, and he finally decided to meet the woman. He was given an address near Rohini’s Sector-24. When he reached there, the woman was waiting for her. She took the victim to a flat where she said that watches were kept.However, upon reaching the flat, Mukesh was pinned down by three men. Before he could understand what was happening, the men snatched his phone and shoved him into a room,” said a police officer.“They started thrashing me and demanded that I arrange Rs 30 lakh immediately. When I told them that I did not have so much money, they asked me to call my friends and ask them for money for my release,” said Mukesh. They continued to thrash him and even smashed his phone.When the victim told his captors that his friend’s contact number was saved in the phone itself, they thrashed him further. Irked by not being able to get anything from the executive, the men tied him up to a chair and gagged him. They then left the place.After an hour-long effort, Mukesh was able to free himself. He came out of the flat in an injured condition, and drove out to a busy road. There, he took help of a passerby and called his friend. He was subsequently shifted to a hospital where the cops were alerted about the incident.Based on the victim’s statement, a case was registered under sections of extortion, causing hurt and wrongful confinement against the men and the woman. Investigating teams are now trying to trace the number which was used by the woman. Efforts are also on to get details about the owner of the flat where the victim was kept confined by the gang."

A total of 9,935 cases of kidnapping were recorded in Bihar, which was 9.4% of such cases across the country.The maximum number of 21,711 kidnapping and abduction cases were reported from Uttar Pradesh, followed by 11,443 in Maharashtra. Mizoram, Sikkim and Nagaland with 3, 74 and 90 cases respectively were at the bottom of the table on such crime. In Bihar, average 8.4 persons per one lakh of the population were kidnapped or abducted against average 8 in the country.Compared to previous year’s data, Bihar witnessed an increase of 1,456 incidents of kidnapping and abduction from 2017 when the number of such cases stood at 8,479 while it was 7,324 in 2016.

Even if a child is missing or a boy runs away before his exam result, or someone elopes in a love affair, a kidnapping case is registered. It is actually a good sign for us that most of the cases are registered. However, the figure for professional kidnapping is only in double digit,” said Vinay. He further said that around 90,000 FIRs were lodged in 2000, around 2.65 lakh in 2018 and the figure for 2019 is likely to cross 3 lakh.Apart from kidnapping and abduction, the state also witnessed an increase of 1,954 incidents of crime against children from 2017 to 2018. As per the NCRB data, total 7,340 such incidents were recorded in 2018, while the figure for 2017 was 5386. However, the state’s rate of crime against children, which is calculated on per one lakh population was 16.4, which was almost half the national average of 31.8 crimes per one lakh population.Altogether 62 children were murdered in Bihar in 2018 and 10 of them were below six years of age, while 17 were between six years to 12 years and 35 above 12 years but below 16 years. Altogether 2,094 incidents of sexual harassment against children were reported in 2018, while 252 children were booked under The Juvenile Justice Care and Protection of Children Act, 2000 & 2015.As per the NCRB figures, major crime against children in 2018 across the country were related to kidnapping and abduction (44.2%) and under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (34.7%), including child rape."

AURANGABAD: Additional sessions judge M S Deshpande has sentenced a youth to life imprisonment till his natural death for kidnapping and raping a minor girl on the terrace of a building here in 2017.Additional public prosecutor Madhukar A Aher said that the youth knew the survivor, who would often visit his home to watch TV programmes. She had even tied rakhi to him barely six days before the incident.The survivor (then 13) lives on the first floor of a two-storey house while her uncle’s family stays on the ground floor. On August 12, 2017, her parents had gone out of station while her brother went out to prepare for a cultural festival. She went to her uncle’s home downstairs and found his family having meal, following which she sat on the verandah.The accused, Pawan Pramod Kulkarni (then 26), arrived at the scene and asked the girl to accompany him, saying that he had urgent work to discuss with her. When the girl asked him what type of work, he told her that she would know only after going with him.Subsequently, Kulkarni led the survivor to the terrace of the building where he stayed in a rented house and forced himself on her after gagging her. He left the girl after threatening her with dire consequences if she revealed the incident to anyone. Her uncle, however, noticed her in a battered shape and immediately informed her parents.The parents arrived the following day, when the survivor narrated the incident to them. They immediately approached police, who arrested the man under Section 376 (A), 376 (2) (i), (n) and 506 of the IPC as well as Section 4 of the POCSO Act.However, at the time framing the charges the additional government pleader Aher urged the court to add more Sections, including 363 (kidnapping) of the IPC and stringent Section 6 of the POCSO Act as it was an aggravated forceful assault on the minor.The prosecution examined eight witnesses, including the survivor’s mother, the woman neighbour who had witnessed the accused taking the girl to the terrace of the building where he raped her and the medical officer."

KOLKATA: A 52-year-old man lost his life after being run over by an ambulance driver after he challenged the driver and his assistant for allegedly trying to molest and kidnap his daughter-in-law in central Kolkata late on Tuesday.The accused ambulance driver — identified as Sk Abdul Rahaman (26) — reportedly stepped on the accelerator, dragging Gopal Pramanick 100 metres.While Gopal’s 28-year-old daughter-in-law, Priyanka, told the cops that her father-in-law tried to protect her and protested against the ambulance driver and helper’s attempt to kidnap her, the cops say they have, so far, found it to be just a case of rash driving Rahaman, a resident of Daulatpur , Maheshtala, was arrested, charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Tajuddin, his 20-year-old helper, was also arrested on the same charges.The incident occurred around 11.50pm on Tuesday, when Gopal, his wife Anima, their daughter Shyamali Acharya and her husband Biswanath Acharya, Priyanka, relative Arun Pramanick, and Priyanka’s three-year-old daughter were returning to their Christopher Road home after attending a wedding.The family members at the spot claimed the driver of the ambulance, coming towards them, stopped the vehicle near Priyanka, who was walking around 30 metres in front.Family members heard Priyanka scream and saw Gopal place himself between the car and her, arguing with the driver. But even as they reached the spot, the driver revved up and rammed into Gopal, dragging him around 100 metres.Priyanka later told cops the driver and the helper were trying to kidnap her. “I noticed the ambulance coming from Topsia towards Tangra police station. Its blue light was working but the siren was off. A little ahead of me, it braked. I noticed two men inside it. The ambulance moved forward a bit and braked again. This continued a couple more times. Suddenly, one of them whispered to the other: ‘Issko utha lete hai (Let’s pick her up).’ The next moment, the driver’s aide opened the door and tried pulling me in as my daughter watched,” she said.Hearing her shout, her family members rushed in to help. “My father-in-law asked the driver why he was behaving in this manner. He stood in front of the vehicle, my uncle was speaking to the acquaintance of the driver. As they saw more locals coming in, the driver accelerated and fled, hitting my father-in-law. I do not know the accused but can surely identify them,” said Biswanath.The family found it difficult to find an ambulance so late at night and instead hired an auto to NRS Hospital, where Gopal died three hours later.Joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma said CCTV footage had so far failed to establish any attempt to molest or kidnap the woman. In fact, footage from eight cameras between China Town and Tangra police station crossing between 11pm and midnight failed to establish that the ambulance stopped at all for any sort of interaction with the family, he said. “But if Priyanka insists on her version, we will investigate,” he told TOI.The ambulance, said cops, was moving from the Park Circus connector towards Tangra. “Rahaman was being helped by Tajuddin, his brother-in-law. They had come to drop a patient at China Town from SSKM Hospital. While returning, they lost their way in the bylanes, even as they kept receiving calls from Vidyasagar Hospital in Behala, telling them to rush. In their haste, the driver drove carelessly and did not notice Gopal standing on the road. After the accident, they fled through Mullickbazar,” said an officer.Gopal gave a dying declaration, based on which the Tangra police registered the case. “There was no mention of kidnapping attempt, either in the initial complaint or dying declaration,” said Ajoy Prasad, DCP (east suburban).The cops and family members, though, agreed on the intensity of the accident. The car hit him so hard that Gopal, who ran a tea shop near the China Town entry, got tangled in the front left wheel, and his clothes were ripped off."

Three minors faked theiron Friday — as they feared a reprimand from their families — after bunking their tuitions and gallivanting throughout the city. Initially, they told their parents that three unknown people had abducted them, only to abandon them after three hours. In a state of panic, the parents approached the cops, who then scrutinised closedcircuit television (CCTV) footage of locations that were narrated by the three minors. With no result at hand, the cops turned suspicious by the minute. It was only after interrogating the children that they could crack the case.The incident came to light around 8.30 pm. The three students aged 13-14 had bunked their classes and went about the city. After sunset, when they perhaps realised that it was too late to go home and that they may get yelled at, they hatched a plan totheir kidnapping. From an unknown number they called their parents and claimed that they were abducted and were finally dropped at Tilak Chowk in. When they were picked from the spot by their parents, they went to Chikhali police as the case fell under the jurisdiction of Rupinagar police chowky.One of the parents told the cops that their kid went to tuition around 5.30 pm on Friday. He had told them that an unknown person came in a car and kidnapped him along with two girls. At 9.30, he had called his parents, saying that three unknown people had abducted him now dropped him back. The minor then requested the parents to pick him up. Based on these statements, the cops began an investigation. They checked the CCTV footage of the spots mentioned by the 13-year-old. However, they could not find a specific car at the locations.Sub-inspector Yogesh Shinde told Mirror, “We reached the spot as soon as we received the information and also scanned the CCTV footage. We did not find any kidnapping-related activity. So, we enquired with locals, who said that they were unaware of the case.”When they could not connect any points, the cops turned towards the children to ask them more questions. “There was something odd about their behaviour. They were not scared and instead behaved normally as if nothing had happened. This stoked our suspicion. When we interrogated them, one of the girls revealed that they had faked their kidnapping,” Shinde added.He said that the children confessed to making the plan since they were scared of going home that late after they had bunked their tuition, which they attend together. Now, the police are counselling the children, where they are told the importance of education and career. They were even told about the gravity of kidnapping — the consequences if it had happened for real. “They regret what they have done and have said that it would not happen again,” the cop said."

MUMBAI: Over a year after he was given death sentence by a trial court, the Bombay HC on Wednesday acquitted a 27-year-old man and a co-convict in a 2012 kidnap-murder of a businessman’s 12-year-old son in the city. “We find that the prosecution has failed to bring home the guilt” of Imtiyaz Shaikh (27) and Azad Ansari (28), the HC said.The duo had been charged with luring the Class 5 boy on May 27, 2012 while his father was away on a trip, seeking a Rs25 lakh ransom and dumping his body in a manhole. They were allegedly employed in a fabric embroidery unit at Dharavi owned by his father, Rajesh Bhadange The high court cited lack of evidence in establishing that ransom calls were made by the duo or that Shaikh led police to the body. There were also no eyewitnesses, the HC bench said.The child’s life was allegedly snuffed by suffocating him and his ribs were found fractured when his body was recovered. The father had initially filed a missing complaint with Shahu Nagar police station.A sessions court had on May 23, 2018 held them guilty and sentenced Shaikh to the gallows and Ansari to life imprisonment.The HC bench of Justices B P Dharmadhikari and Swapna Joshi didn’t accept the ‘last seen’ theory of the prosecutor J P Yagnik and observed that it was propounded only after arrest of the accused. The case was one of circumstantial evidence, Shaikh’s lawyer Ravi Dwivedi and Ansari’s advocate Fakruddin Khan argued. The circumstances are required to link together into a chain in a manner that points only to the accused and no one else. In this case, the chain had chinks, held the court.The state can and may decide to appeal the HC ruling before the Supreme Court. It has two months to appeal. Yagnik said later “a decision will be taken after reading the entire judgment.”Both the accused, in jail since June 2012, are to be released from prison now. Shaikh was taken to Nashik prison after conviction, Ansari was in Arthur Road jail in Mumbai.Police had said the mobile phone used to make ransom calls and SIM cards were recovered from Shaikh and call data records showed a total of four accused to be constantly in touch.The sessions court judge had last May acquitted two other accused—Israr Shaikh, 25, and A Ahmed, 44—for lack of evidence. Another accused, arrested in 2012, was declared a juvenile in 2018 and his trial directed to be separately conducted before a Juvenile Justice Board.Shaikh’s counsel Dwivedi pointed out discrepancies in the prosecution case and the doubts that remained. He also questioned the time of Shaikh’s arrest and the alleged recovery of three handsets and 10 SIM cards from him. He said the SIM cards were never tested by police, nor was it established that Shaikh had made ransom calls from his number. Police had submitted call data records (CDR) on calls received by the businessman.“The ‘last seen’ by itself cannot constitute the valid ground here,” said the HC. “Even if we assume the prosecution story to be correct, the deceased boy was last seen by a witness with juvenile accused and Shaikh. Thus Ansari was not with them.”The HC held that the CDR doesn’t disclose the conversation between the accused, nor does it show phone numbers. The prosecution had only relied on IMIE numbers of allegedly recovered handsets.The prosecution had said Shaikh had been fired over six months before the crime from his job by Rajesh as he was not working properly and he then exacted revenge with the kidnap and murder . According to the prosecution, the accused kidnapped and murdered the boy the same day. They anticipated trouble if they kept him alive, after taking him to Bhiwandi. Later, they kept demanding a ransom of Rs25 lakh from the father, till their arrest next month, on June 5.Dwivedi argued that Shaikh never worked for Rajesh and it was Ansari who did, till his arrest. Dwivedi also said he had not been heard on the quantum of sentence by the trial court.The prosecution could not determine the exact time of death, and the HC found the police failed to satisfactorily establish the body’s recovery.The HC found there were “inconsistencies” over the time of Shaikh’s arrest and held that the “version of prosecution on arrests of accused cannot be accepted.” Dwivedi said they were with crime branch for over nine hours on June 5 while the police station said it had arrested them and recovered cell phones and SIM cards from them.Police said ransom calls were made from Bhiwandi. “Rajesh stated he was requesting that person to reduce the amount and to show him his son. All these conversations were tape-recorded and police listened to it. Police tried to verify the address and name of person calling, but was unable to,” the HC noted.A death sentence has be confirmed by the HC before it is executable."

MUMBAI: Crime branch on Tuesday cracked a 20-year-old kidnapping-and-murder case, which was closed twice after police failed to trace the suspect. Main accused Sajjid Abdul Rashid Arai (44), on the run since 1999, was staying in Shrivardhan in Raigad with a fictitious identity.Unit IX, which was discreetly working on the case, got a tip-off that Aria often travelled to Mumbai for his fishing business. “After keeping a watch for some time, our team, led by inspector Sanjeev Gawde and Asha Korke, laid a trap and arrested Arai, who flashed ID cards showing his name as Moin Ahmed Kadri. He admitted he was Arai after sustained interrogation,” said senior inspector Mahesh Desai.In 1999, a senior PWD official from Patna, Bihar, lodged an FIR with Juhu police, that his son, Amit Kumar Ramavtar, studying at IIT-B, had gone missing, and some people demanded a ransom of Rs 5 crore. After bargaining, the amount was reduced to Rs 5 lakh, but the accused got scared as the father was influential. He and his accomplice forced Amit to drink liquor, killed him and dumped his body in a creek in Vasai, and fled.Juhu police had registered a kidnapping case as the body was not found. In 2000, they closed the case, classifying it as ‘A summary’, that is when police submit a detail investigation report in court that the case is true, but undetected despite efforts. But the father, Ramavtar, approached courts. In 2007, on a court direction, the case was handed over to crime branch. In 2008, crime branch submitted an ‘A summary’ report and closed investigations too, said DCP Akbar Pathan.After police arrested Arai, he told them that the victim, studying with them, said he was the son of an influential person.

PATNA: A 28-year-old woman, mother of two and wife of a Jharkhand police constable, who had gone missing from her house under the Chutia police station area in Ranchi on November 30, was found at the house of a 21-year-old youth at Bettiah in Bihar’s West Champaran district by a police team from the neighbouring state in the wee hours of Wednesday.Police said the woman had probably fled home with the youth, Partha Sarkar, after developing an affair with him through a popular social networking site. Sarkar was arrested by the Jharkhand police team from his rented accommodation in Bengali Colony locality of Bettiah town.“The woman is wife of a Jharkhand police constable and the couple have an eight-year-old son and a two-year-old daughter. The woman’s little daughter was also found at the rented house of Sarkar,” Jharkhand police sub-inspector (SI) Suryakant Kumar said.SHO of Ranchi’s Chutia police station Ravi Thakur told TOI over the phone that the woman’s husband had lodged a missing complaint on November 30 after she became traceless. “The complaint was later converted into an FIR on December 8,” the SHO added.SI Suryakant said the Jharkhand police team reached Bettiah at 3.30am on Wednesday and raided Sarkar’s rented accommodation. “Sarkar works at a private firm in Bettiah. He was produced in a court in Bettiah which granted his 28-hour transit remand,” the SI said, adding a kidnapping case was lodged after the woman went missing from her house.“Technical investigations helped us locate the woman. Sarkar had gone to Ranchi to bring the woman to his home on November 30. After reaching Bettiah along with her two-year-old daughter, the woman started living with Sarkar. The two had switched off their cellphones after leaving Ranchi on November 30,” the SI said, adding Partha will be produced before a Ranchi court. “The woman’s statement will also be recorded at the court of judicial magistrate,” he said."

Bareilly: Two constables, Akshay Uppal and Nikhil Pawar, were among three persons arrested for allegedly kidnapping a 22-year-old man in UP’s Moradabad and “demanding ransom money from his family to let him free”. Pawar’s cousin Ashish was also arrested. The two constables have been suspended, police said on Saturday.Moradabad man Salman, said to be a police informer, was asked to reach near a canal from where he was allegedly kidnapped by the cops who later informed his family that special operations group (SOG) team had taken him into custody to probe a matter. They later demanded Rs 2 lakh in lieu of releasing him. According to police sources, Salman used to provide information to the two constables.Notably, Thakurdwara circle officer Vishal Yadav said that Salman was a resident of Ganinagar under Mudhapandey police station and was part of a baggage lifting gang. “During investigation, Salman confessed that he had been involved in stealing bags of train passengers and committed several thefts near Gorakhpur. The government railway police and railway protection force have been informed and we asked them to trace his criminal record. But, we have no concrete proof against him yet,” Yadav, the deputy superintendent of police (DSP), said.According to police, Uppal had come in contact with Salman about six months ago after he raided a gambling site. Though, he didn’t get any success, he found a mobile phone from the crime scene which eventually led him to Salman. Over the period, Uppal developed a good rapport with him as the latter became his informer. Salman used to give him important leads and based on his tip off, Uppal managed to crack several cases. Salman had reportedly informed him about his nexus in the Gorakhpur railway station area.“On Thursday, Uppal learnt that Salman had just returned from Gorakhpur after committing a theft and had money. He shared the information with his colleague Pawar and hatched a plan to recover money from Salman by threatening him in the name of SOG. Their plan, however, didn’t work,” the DSP said.Uppal is a native of Muzaffarnagar while Pawar and his cousin belong to Baghpat district. After “kidnapping” Salman, the trio took him around in a moving car for two hours and let him go only when they learnt that they were on the radar of other cops. Before leaving home, Salman had told his family that he was going to meet Uppal.Police arrested the trio from Bhojpur area and lodged an FIR under sections 364A (kidnapping for ransom) and 392 (punishment for robbery) of IPC. “Both the policemen have been suspended and a report against them has been sent to police headquarters,” the DSP added."

KOCHI: Ernakulam Rural police has recorded a steady rise in the number of kidnappings and abductions over the past five years even as Kochi city police numbers show a decline.According to the latest report of the District Crime Records Bureau, a total of 37 kidnapping cases were reported in rural areas of the district 2019. Of these, 27 involved a woman or girl victim. In 2016, the total number of cases stood at 11.The city police registered 13 cases in 2015. This dropped to six in 2019, after rising to 19 in 2017.According to police officials, the majority of such abductions involve sexual abuse. “We invoke IPC sections 370 (trafficking) and 363 (kidnapping) along with offences like rape and child abuse. This is actually a graver offence as the victim is not in a position to give consent or is tricked into being taken somewhere,” said M J Sojan, additional superintendent of police, Ernakulam.Experts say the higher numbers in rural areas is because it is difficult to hush up such cases in such neighbourhoods. Fr Jenson Varyath, director of Ernakulam Childline, said city parents are less likely to come out and report such an offence than those in rural areas. “Now, due to various awareness drives, more cases of sexual abuse are getting reported in rural areas. It is difficult to keep things quiet in a rural neighbourhood as compared to the city where things can be kept under wraps. Also, parents are not that forthcoming in reporting such crimes in the city,” said Fr Varyath.Police say most of the kidnapping cases in the district involve either minor girls cheated on the pretext of love or women given false promises, including of marriage, and are taken to various locations where they are sexually assaulted.ASP Sojan added that officers realizing the need for adding the charge of abduction to sexual abuse cases due to the efforts of police wings like the anti-human trafficking unit is also another reason for the spike in rural areas. P S Muhammed Ashraf, a police official who works with the special juvenile police unit (SJPU), said there have been instances where child labourers were rescued, only to reveal a kidnapping or abduction angle.“In many cases, follow-up investigations would suggest that the children were trafficked from other states or other districts. In such cases too, FIRs are registered for kidnapping and abduction,” said Ashraf.Moreover, Bindu P A, special public prosecutor with the Ernakulam Pocso court, said that about 40% of abuse cases get settled due to various reasons, such as the victim refusing to go forward with the complaint.“At least in Ernakulam, most cases with enough evidence lead to conviction. In fact, around six in 10 cases lead to conviction. However, due to the vast area that comes under the Ernakulam court, there are around 450 cases which are pending,” said Bindu."

AURANGABAD: With Maharashtra recording the highest number of missing cases of women and children in the country, the state police are preparing for a special drive to track down the missing/kidnapped persons.Authorities said the drive follows a high-level meeting chaired by the state home minister on February 10.As per the latest communication from the Prevention of Atrocities against Women (PAW), a special cell of the director-general of police, a month-long drive will start on March 1. The authorities have received the letter signed by special IGP Pratap Dighavkar, who currently heads PAW.An officer deployed with PAW maintained that abuse, in any form, is one of the key reasons for women and children to flee home. “Women and children fleeing home are most vulnerable to trafficking and other abuses, making it a concern for the law enforcement agencies as well,” said the officer.As per the directive issued by PAW, all the cases related to missing and kidnapped women ageing above 18-years, between the years 2015 and 2019 will be probed afresh in the month-long drive, across the state. To ensure that the drive yields results, all the superintendents as well as commissioners of police in the state have been asked to ensure that the drive-related data and developments (if any) are updated to the state police headquarters-based control room by 9 pm every day.As a preparation for the drive, the authorities have been asked to get police station-wise data of missing women and children, and accordingly, make advanced preparations. All the data on these missing and kidnapped persons have to be compiled by February 29, before the drive kicks off.As per the data published by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) in the year 2016, as many as 28, 316 cases of missing women were reported from Maharashtra. In 2017, the number rose to 29, 279, while in 2018, the number reached 33, 964. Though the figures for 2019 have not been released yet, considering the average surge in the cases of missing women in the state, the number is likely to increase.Following the directives, respective unit commanders are forming special teams across police stations to work on these cases. Also, the crime branch and other special cells have been directed to assist the special squads at the police station level."

A kidnapping case was registered against the five accused.The accused took away the contractor, Raji Reddy, of Ramanthapur from a lodge at around 5.45 pm. “We arrested the five accused and rescued Reddy,” Sultan Bazar inspector K Subbarami Reddy said.Police said the issue was over Reddy refusing to pay money for a work the accused had done.

Aurangabad: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court, in a relief to three members of an Ahmednagar-based family, quashed and set aside an FIR filed against them for kidnap of a 19-year-old woman and theft at her mother’s home.The girl had left her mother’s home and married a man of her choice. Based on a complaint by her mother, a 46-year-old resident of Mukundnagar, the Topkhana police had booked Shahrukh Shaikh (28), a businessman, his father Khalil (48) and mother Sharifa (43) of Sangamner.The woman said her daughter left for college and but didn’t return. She initially filed a missing complaint. Then, Shahrukh called her to inform that he and her daughter were getting married. The woman went to the police accusing the Shaikhs of kidnap. She added her daughter had taken Rs 1.5 lakh and jewellery of Rs 38,000 from home.The Shaikhs, and the woman’s daughter, moved the HC by filing separate criminal application, seeking to quash the FIR and subsequent proceedings. Both applications were heard simultaneously.While allowing the criminal application on December 2, the bench comprising Justices T V Nalawade and N B Suryawanshi noted the statement of the girl, in which she said she had a relationship with Shahrukh and that she left on her own to avoid marrying as per her mother’s choice. The court observed: “Her statement does not show the other applicants had any role to play. There is record of marriage created as per Muslim religion.” The bench added: “It is unfortunate the girl’s mother has made such allegations only because the girl left home to marry applicant No. 1 (Shahrukh). It cannot be believed that ornaments purchased in 2016, which are ordinarily kept on person, were kept in cupboard.”It added: “It also does not look probable that cash of Rs 1.5 lakh that was part of sale proceeds of transaction of 2017 was kept in cupboard of informant (the mother). That transaction of sale was made by others, not by informant.”The bench said: “It will be abuse of process of law if the applicants are made to face the trial for aforesaid offences.”"

GURUGRAM: A dispute over a parking place in Chakkarpur village on Sunday escalated into a communal clash after a group of men from the Yadav community allegedly barged into the house of one Bhagwat Dayal, a Dalit , and tried to kidnap his 20-year-old daughter.Dayal’s son Divin told police that at least five men barged into their house around 11.30am and tried to kidnap his sister. “As my sister tried to fight the men, one of them hit her on her nose with a weapon and she started bleeding profusely,” Divin said.He further added that when he and his brothers intervened, they were also beaten up. “As our community members came to our rescue, they fled from our house,” he added.The woman was taken to a nearby hospital where she received 14 stitches on her nose and is undergoing treatment.Divin added that when they stepped out from their house to go to the hospital, several other men from the Yadav community were allegedly standing guard as a backup of the goons who had barged into his house.“This is not the first time that the people from the Yadav community have misbehaved with those from the Dalit community. Earlier as well, they have threatened us,” Divin, who was accompanied by other members of the Dalit community, said.An FIR has been registered under sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with a deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of an offence committed in prosecution of common object), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 365 (kidnapping or abducting with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine person), 452 (house trespassing), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 511(attempting to commit offences punishable with imprisonment for life or other imprisonments) of the IPC and Section 31 of the SC/ST Act at Sushant Lok 1 police station.“We have registered an FIR and are investigating the matter. The whole issue started from differences over a parking spot and then escalated into a full-fledged fight between the two groups,” said an officer."

NEW DELHI: A two-year-old girl who was kidnapped from Palam Village last Saturday was reunited with her family on Friday. Two men who had hatched the plan to kidnap the child have been arrested.The prime accused, Virender Dutt, had brought in an accomplice, Nikhil Choudhary, by promising him one-third of Rs 3 lakh for which he had planned to “sell” the child. Dutt, however, had kidnapped the girl as he was childless. He had even created fake documents of an adoption centre in Faridabad to keep her.The kidnapping occurred on November 23 when the girl and her 11-year-old brother were playing outside a temple. The two accused went there on a motorcycle and tried to engage the children in a conversation. They then went inside the temple. Coincidentally, when they came out, the girl and her brother were seated on their motorcycle. They took them for a joyride, dropped the boy just before Dwarka and sped away with the girl.Police scanned CCTV footage from the temple and got an unclear description of the accused. They tried to match the photos of the accused with police records, but to no avail. Cops put up posters of the girl and started tracking the possible route taken by the kidnappers. In another footage, police were able to spot a motorcycle headed towards Najafgarh and got a partial numberplate (HR 06 159).After scanning possible matches with registration numbers of motorcycles, two of them surfaced, one in Panipat and one in Sirsa. The Panipat motorcycle couldn’t be traced, but the owner in Sirsa was tracked. He told police that he had sold the bike. However, the buyer informed that it had been stolen.“When further CCTV footage was scanned, we found one of the accused men entering lane number 7 in Palam Village riding the two-wheeler. At the exit of the lane, both the accused were spotted,” said DCP (Southwest) Devender Arya.Cops then conducted a door-to-door search, spotted one of the accused coming down the stairs of a house and nabbed him. The man, identified as Choudhary, told police he had come to Delhi three months ago and Dutt had lured him into committing the crime. Subsequently, Dutt’s number was put on surveillance and tracked to Nihal Vihar. A raid was conducted late at night and Dutt was arrested from his house. The girl was also recovered.Dutt’s family was unaware about the kidnapping as he had told them that he had adopted the girl from Geeta Ashram. The fake adoption certificate was recovered from his house. Dutt told police that he had purchased the motorcycle from one Gagan. The motorcycle was also seized during the raid."

THRISSUR: Police are hunting a group of men who kidnapped a film director near Chittilappilli Mulloorkkayal area in Thrissur on Wednesday morning.A group of people wearing masks stopped Nishad Hassan and his wife Pratheeksha as they were driving to Guruvayur. The abductors who came in another car, waylaid the couple. They brutally attacked the director and the woman when she tried to protect him, Pratheeksha said in her statement to Peramangalam police . The abductors bundled him into a car and sped away, leaving the woman behind.Police said Pratheeksha, who was injured in the attack, was admitted to Amala Hospital and later discharged.Hassan’s film “Viplavam Jayikkanullathanu’’ was released last Friday. Hassan and Pratheeksha were going to Guruvayur to make offerings at the temple there after the film’s release. In her statement to police, Pratheeksha said there were some disputes between Hassan and the film’s producer and that her husband’s abduction could be linked to it.Hassan has made a few short films and documentaries and “Viplavam Jayikkanullathanu’’ was his first full-length feature. The nearly two-hour film has created a record of sorts as it was made in a single shot. One of the film’s crew members said the shooting was completed in 2017 and that the post-production works got delayed after the relationship between producer and director turned sour.Police officers said efforts are on to trace Hassan and nab the kidnappers. Pratheeksha’s family members said they have not received any information on the whereabouts of Hassan. His mobile phone is at home and the police have looked into the call details.City police commissioner Yathish Chandra said four teams have been formed to conduct investigations into the kidnap case, and that Guruvayur assistant commissioner of police is supervising the investigation. CCTV visuals from nearby areas are also being examined, he said."

PATNA: A 23-year-old college student from Gaya, who was on a trip to the famed Kakolat waterfall in Nawada with friends, was allegedly kidnapped, beaten up and forced to marry a teenage girl at gunpoint at a nearby village late on Sunday, police said.Nityanand Kumar Rai, who was rescued by the police and is undergoing treatment at a government hospital in Gaya, fell victim to what is colloquially known as ‘pakadua vivah’ or forced marriage, which cops say is a regular occurrence in the region.In his police complaint, Nityanand Kumar Rai alleged that he and his friends were waylaid by some youths, who came on three bikes and forcibly took them to Singhana village, where he was forced to tie the knot with a Class X student of a Nawada school.“I was not only threatened but also beaten up when I refused to follow their orders. Me and my friends were held captive in separate rooms. Around midnight, some residents came with illegal firearms, threatened me and forced me to marry the girl,” Rai told the police.The next morning Rai was told to stay at his ‘newly wedded’ wife’s house while his two friends were released with a warning not to inform the police.His friends, however, informed Nityanand’s father Shankar Rai, a resident of Paharpur in neighbouring Gaya district, about the incident. Rupau police swung into action and rescued the youth from the girl’s house after the intervention of senior police officers.“The girl was taken to Nawada (civil) court to record her statement but the court has directed her to appear on Wednesday,” Rupau SHO Santosh Kumar said. Further action will be taken on the court’s directive since it’s a case of ‘ pakarua vivah ’, he added.The ‘bride’, however, claimed that she knew the man’s family. “I had met Nityanand when he visited the village on June 15 to attend a wedding ceremony. We knew each other for long,” she told the police when she was called for questioning.The police have lodged a case under Section 366 (kidnapping for marriage) of IPC against the girl’s family members. SHO Kumar said ‘pakarua vivah’ is quite common in the region. Such cases were reported mainly from Munger, Nawada, Khagaria and Begusarai districts where prospective bridegrooms are kidnapped for marriage.In December 2017, a 29-year-old Bokaro Steel City engineer was kidnapped from Patna and forced to marry a young girl. A video showing the forced marriage of the engineer had gone viral on social media and an FIR was lodged in January 2018.Statistics available with the state crime record bureau revealed that altogether 1,097 cases of ‘pakarua vivah’ have been reported in the state so far. In 2018, a total of 4,301 cases were registered in the state compared to 3,678 in 2017 while 3,070 men were kidnapped for ‘pakadua vivah’ in 2016, 3,000 in 2015 and 2,526 in 2014.“What is noticeable is that such cases are on the rise in the state,” a senior IPS officer said. The state government has directed the police to take tough action against those demanding dowry. The cops have been told to implement the provisions of Anti-Dowry Act more effectively."

Extensive surveillance was mounted on possible suspects who might throw up leads.One of the numbers under surveillance belonged to one Sanjeev Chawla , but it went off the radar after being switched off for a few weeks. Sometime later, the number came alive and the police intercepted a series of conversations with a ""foreigner"". Inspector Ishwar Singh , who heard all the conversations out of plain curiosity, was left startled by what he ended up listening to.A quick probe into the antecedents of the number revealed that the foreigner allegedly conversing with Chawla was South African cricket captain Hansie Cronje . The police dug deeper, and soon unearthed one of the biggest ever match-fixing scandals.Chawla was found to be in touch with punters across India to fix the highest bidder.During one conversation tapped by the anti-extortion cell, the police heard him telling someone: ""The captain will come to my room."" They were not sure which captain he was talking about. However, they soon learned that Chawla had a meeting on March 14, 2000 in room 346 of a 5-star hotel in Delhi. After scanning the hotel records, they found that he had met Cronje. It also emerged that ODIs played between India and South Africa in March 2000 had been fixed for ""exchange or consideration"" of money.The case eventually went cold, but got a fresh lease of life in 2013 when then police commissioner Neeraj Kumar reopened it while investigating the IPL spot-fixing racket.On Thursday, Kumar told a news agency that it was during the IPL probe that a media person had pointed out that not even a chargesheet had been filed in the case. ""I asked the then DCP (crime), Alok Kumar , to pursue an extradition and file a chargesheet. I even got in touch with the CBI for this. It was found that the files were lying at the Ashok Vihar police station. It was revived and the chargesheet was filed a day before my retirement,"" he said.In 2016, the crime branch moved court for extradition. Since then the foreign ministry, intelligence wing and Delhi Police had been doggedly pursuing Chawla's extradition."

DIBRUGARH: An employee of a stone-crushing unit was kidnapped by suspected Ulfa-I rebels from upper Assam's Tinsukia district on Tuesday evening. The victim, Baikuntha Handique (26), a resident of Jagun, was working as a supervisor of the stone-crushing unit owned by Raju Khan of Digboi Confirming the development, Tinsukia superintendent of police Shiladitya Chetia on Wednesday said, ""One Baikuntha Handique, an employee of a stone-crushing unit, has been missing since yesterday (Tuesday). According to information received, he had crossed the river at Wara, southeas tof Jagun, to reach a stone quarry, but has not returned since. We suspect he has been kidnapped by Ulfa-I rebels. We have started a search operation to ascertain his whereabouts. Our counterparts in Arunachal Pradesh have also been intimated and they are aiding us in the operation.""I tmay be mentioned that in November 2018, a manager of a stone-crushing plant in Jagun, Apurba Kakoty , was abducted by Ulfa-I militants. He was released after eight days following payment of a hefty ransom.Similarly in October 2019, Gauranga Sudar Deb , a head fitter of Sankar Tea Estate in Talap of Tinsukia district, was abducted at gunpoint by Ulfa-I militants. The abduction was captured on CCTV cameras installed in the factory of the tea garden. Deb was set free after 12 days.According to intelligence agencies, the Paresh Baruah-led Ulfa-I has been facing acute fund shortage since the military offensive by the Myanmar army against northeast based militant groups operating from Myanmar. Moreover the banned outfit is said to be still reeling from the effect of demonetisation as they reportedly failed to convert their stash of banned high currency note into legal tenders. With funds becoming scarce, the militant outfit has been trying to recoup their losses by indulging in mass extortion targeting the business community and tea planters, especially in the upper Assam districts. The outfit has been indulging in extortion as well as carrying out abduction in the border district of Tinsukia which also serves as a transit point for the militants to cross over to Myanmar through Arunachal Pradesh, where their camps are located."

AGRA: Aligarh police has booked the chief medical superintendent (CMS) and her staff of the government's district women's hospital on charges of ""kidnapping"" a newborn boy after a couple lodged a complaint claiming that the hospital staff handed them just one child while the woman was carrying “twins”.According to complainant Satendra Kumar, his wife Sangeeta was under treatment at Aligarh’s Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyay Joint Hospital during her pregnancy. He claimed that during the course of treatment, three ultrasounds were conducted, in February, March, and May this year by the hospital staff, and according to the report, his wife was carrying “twins”.The complainant further said that his wife had delivered “twins” on June 9, at the district women’s hospital, but only a baby boy was given to the family members. He alleged that the doctors and nurses, who were on duty that day had ""stolen"" his second child.However, Aligarh senior superintendent of police Akash Kulhary told TOI that a doctors’ panel formed by the chief medical officer re-examined the radiologist’s report and found it to be “erroneous”. “Police investigation is still on though,” he said.Chief medical officer Dr ML Agarwal said that the medical panel concluded that no evidence was found to support the complainant’s claim of his wife giving birth to “twins”. Agarwal said that the hospital’s radiologist had admitted his mistake of wrongly mentioning “twins” in the report and action will be taken against him.Aruna Rai, SHO of Banna Devi police station in Tappal, told TOI that the CMS, an unidentified doctor and a nurse had been booked under sections 363 (kidnapping), and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of IPC.When contacted, the visibly upset CMS said, “An FIR should have been lodged only after the panel’s decision.”"

Nagpur: Shrichand Chandwani, who is getting his documents together to get Indian citizenship under CAA, also keeps two more papers handy — a birth certificate of his daughter Pooja, who is now 24 years old, and a police complaint filed back in Derki town of Sindh province in Pakistan after her abduction.While he is keen to get an Indian passport, Shrichand also longs to be reunited with his daughter, who he claims was abducted by locals from a neighbouring village in Pakistan, and has now been converted to Islam. The birth certificate is to prove that Pooja was a minor of 16 years when she was taken away in March 2011, as mentioned in the police complaint. According to Pakistani law a minor cannot be married off even with her wishes. Shrichand hopes that Indian authorities take note and intervene in the matter to get her back.Pooja’s abduction took place a year before that of Rinkle Kumari, which drew international limelight, but Pooja remain a forgotten footnote. The family alleges the involvement of a politician — Miya Abdul Haq aka Miya Mithu — in Pooja’s kidnapping. The politician is linked with many other cases too, they said.“Around 8 to 10 armed persons, including a woman, barged into my house and dragged my daughter Pooja Kumari to a car,” says the report written in Sindhi language. “The complainant has alleged that his daughter has been abducted,” says a note below by the police with a seal on it.“The real culprit was Kamran Khan, who is now her husband, living in the neighbouring village Lagar,” says Shrichand, who says that he knocked every door, from the local panchayat to the court, but in vain. “Finally, my daughter herself deposed against me saying that she went away willingly and we lost the case,” he says.“They also kidnapped and confined me for three days. I was stripped off and beaten, leaving my private parts injured, and had to undergo a surgery. They brought my daughter to the hideout where I was kept. They threatened to wipe out our entire family if she did not cooperate,” he alleges.Shrichand says they soon fled to India as he feared his other daughter would also meet the same fate. Initially, only he got the visa for India. Once here, he met the then home minister P Chidambaram with the help of Kailash Joshi, a BJP member of Parliament, he says, showing a letter. “Chidambaram promptly got the visas cleared, and my family shifted to India, finally reaching Nagpur,” he says. Now, the family is on a long term visa.“We are ruined now. I had a mansion in Pakistan, here it is a dingy rented apartment. A cloth trader there, now I sell vegetables on a handcart,” he says.“One needs money to travel back to Pakistan and plead the case for my daughter’s release. You have to spend at least Rs50,000 on a single trip and we are hand to mouth these days,” says his wife Shradha.The last they could establish any contact with her was two-and-a-half years go on phone, says the family. “We left Pakistan soon after but could manage to establish contact with Kamran’s family through our relative there. It ended with a brief conversation with her. We have heard that she is a mother of three children now,” says the mother.“In the court, she acted as if she does not recognize us at all,” she said. “It was because she was under threat,” adds Shrichand as he shoes a passport sized photo of Pooja, which is among the few memories of her left."

PATNA: Altogether 36 cases of kidnapping for murder were recorded across the state in the first three months of the current year against 22 in 2017, 31 in 2016 and 15 in 2015 during the same period.Two major cases of kidnapping and subsequent murder were recorded recently – one in Begusarai on Tuesday and another in Nawada on Wednesday.In Begusarai, a 60-year-old trader, Prithvi Chaudhary, was kidnapped from his shop under Birpur police station area in broad daylight on Tuesday. He was shot dead barely few kilometres away from the spot on the same day.On Wednesday, police recovered mutilated bodies of three youths – Jitendra Kumar alias Rinku, Raj Kumar alias Pallu and Vicky Kumar Rajak – from a shrine on Borambagh hills under Kauwakol police station area in Nawada. The three were kidnapped from Jamui on May 24.According to data available on the state police website, 11 cases of kidnapping for murder were reported in January, five in February and 20 in March this year.As far as kidnapping for ransom is concerned, seven such cases were recorded in the state between January and March this year against 15 in 2018, nine in 2017, 12 in 2016 and 14 in 2015 during the same period.The consolidated data of kidnapping for murder cases reported between April and June this year is yet to be compiled by the state police headquarters.“Personal enmity, revenge and rivalry between two criminal gangs or groups are mainly responsible for kidnapping for murder cases. On the other hand, organised criminal gangs kidnap people for ransom. All such gangs have been dealt with strongly by police. We have ensured conviction of these criminals through speedy trial. As a result, cases of kidnapping for ransom have come down in the state,” ADG (headquarters) Kundan Krishnan said."

TRICHY: The all women police in Jeeyapuram booked a youth for kidnapping a 17-year-old girl and marrying her before sexually assaulting her.The accused has been identified as A Dinesh from Avarankadu. He was charged under IPC, an adult marrying a minor girl under Prohibition of Child Marriage Act and penetrative sexual assault on her more than once under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act.According to police, the girl was studying first year in a Trichy college and was known to him for the past few years. On November 22, the girl went to college but did not return home. Her mother searched for her but could not find her. Later, she came to know that her daughter was kidnapped by Dinesh and he had married her.On Friday, her mother lodged a complaint with the AWPS, Jeeyapuram accusing Dinesh of kidnapping her daughter and marrying her. She also alleged that the youth committed penetrative sexual assault on her daughter. Acting on the complaint, police registered a case against him on Friday. Police sources said that they are searching for him. The minor girl would be sent for medical examination.Incidences of child marriages remain one of the serious concerns in Trichy district. In most cases, the parents arrange for the marriages of their minor daughters with adult men in their community to prevent love marriages with other caste people. There are cases where poverty has forced the parents to push their minor daughters into marriage.Though the district social welfare department has been creating awareness against child marriages, the social evil continues to prevail."

They lodged a police complaint following which a kidnapping case was registered against an unidentified person.A preliminary investigation revealed that the girl, who was addicted to her smartphone, had taken to online gaming over a year ago and often remained glued to her device. As PUBG allowed a voice interaction among the players, the girl came in contact with the youth and they started talking frequently.An officer privy to the probe said that the girl’s family was unaware of her contact with the youth, until she went missing. The suspect, who is also a junior college student, first befriended the girl online . On November 19, he reached Nanded and took the minor with him to his hometown in Punjab. The Wazirabad police relied on technical details as well as checking internet footprints to zero down on the suspected kidnapper.Nanded superintendent of police Vijaykumar Magar said the incident has highlighted the extent to which minors are vulnerable to traps laid using social media and online games. “On social media as well as online gaming applications, one comes across unknown users from places from across the globe, making minors, in particular, susceptible to such traps,” said SP Magar. In light of the incident, police have appealed to parents and guardians to restrict and monitor the use of mobile phones by minors, while respecting their privacy."

JAMSHEDPUR/RANCHI: The decapitated bodies of seven Christian Murmu tribals were found strewn deep inside the Saranda forest of Jharkhand’s West Singhbhum district late on Tuesday, bolstering suspicion of a violent feud between two local groups over reviving the Pathalgarhi tribal autonomy movement that had been dealt with an iron hand by the erstwhile BJP-led government.TOI had reported on Wednesday about heavy police deployment in the area amid unconfirmed reports about seven villagers being killed for their opposition to the stir. While West Singhbhum SP Indrajit Mahata had said a dispute over the Pathalgarhi movement was the possible trigger for the killings, the police came out with a more open-ended hypothesis after the bodies were found.DGP K N Choubey, who chaired a meeting of the police brass in Ranchi and briefed CM Hemant Soren about the developments, said the investigation was still in a preliminary stage. “We have formed an SIT under the Chaibasa DSP and directed him to probe the killings from all possible angles,” he said. “The SIT should not be prejudiced by the version of the villagers and conduct a neutral investigation. There could be more than meets the eye.”Sources claimed the police had already pieced together information that suggests supporters of the Pathalgarhi movement kidnapped the seven men, aged between 24 and 35, on Sunday and killed them in retaliation for their opposition to the move to revive the stir. The unidentified killers dumped the bodies, including that of a panchayat representative, in the dense Saranda forest, around 3km from Burugulikera village, the sources added.Burugulikera is 150km west of the steel city of Jamshedpur.IGP (operations) Saket Kumar Singh said a police team had reached Burugulikera late on Tuesday after getting information about the killings. Till Wednesday evening, the police hadn’t identified the bodies or picked up any of the suspects.While senior police officers claimed the faces of the victims were mutilated beyond recognition, local sources identified those killed as deputy gram sabha mukhiya James Buda and fellow villagers Songe Topna, Lomba Buda, Etva Buda, Jawra Buda, Nirmal Buda and Bonam Longa. The bodies have been sent to Sadar Hospital in Chaibasa for post-mortem.According to sources, a group of tribals keen on reviving the Pathalgarhi movement in West Singhbhum had organised a meeting in Gudri block on Sunday and invited residents of all nearby villages to attend it. A handful of villagers are said to have opposed the idea, resulting in a clash. The seven victims were kidnapped the same evening, the sources said.Soon after the bodies were found, a political slugfest erupted between BJP and the new JMM-led government over CM Soren withdrawing all sedition cases that had been filed against Pathalgarhi activists by the erstwhile Raghubar Das ministry.Expressing “deep anguish” over the killings, BJP’s newly elected national president J P Nadda formed a six-member fact-finding team of elected representatives from various states to visit Burugulikera and submit a report within a week."

JAIPUR: A special Pocso court in Sawai Madhopur on Monday acquitted a doctor in a case of kidnapping and raping a minor girl and directed the state government to pay him a compensation of Rs 5 lakh.The court also directed additional chief secretary (home) to conduct an inquiry against the police officers, including the then superintendent of police, deputy superintendent of police and circle inspector, to find out if the matter was investigated with a mala fide intention.The judge asked the government to lodge an FIR against them and refer the matter to CBI if they are found guilty of falsely implicating the doctor— Om Prakash Meena who was then posted at the government hospital in Gangapur City—in the case.The court has further directed the state government to pay a compensation of Rs 5 lakh and deduct the same from the accused policemen if they are found guilty.The accused policemen in the incident include the then Sawai Madhopur SP Maman Singh, deputy SP Narendra Kumar and Sadar police station CI Rewar Mal. The police officers will be sent to lines and not given any field duty until the investigation is over.Speaking to TOI on Tuesday, Bhola Shankar Sharma, the counsel for doctor Om Prakash Meena, said, “On February 26, 2018, a case of kidnapping and rape was registered against Dr Om Prakash, senior medical officer posted at the government hospital in Gangapur City. The police filed a chargesheet in the case and presented 16 witnesses, 32 documentary evidences. However, all these witnesses and evidences proved to be wrong and failed to sustain the case in the court.”“We brought to the notice of the court that the minor girl’s family had been blackmailing and extorting money from various people, including retired IAS officers, high court lawyers, bankers and some businessmen. As per the minor girl, the incident took place at 11am. However, the FIR was registered at 8pm. Also the medical examination of the girl did not establish that she was raped. What is more shocking is that the girl was not a minor when the incident happened as she has herself claimed she was 18 in her 164 CrPC statement,” the counsel said.The girl had also claimed that she had called up the police after the incident from her mobile.“However, there was no seizure of mobile phone that belonged to the girl by the police. This also shows mala fide intent to wrongly implicate my client in the case,” he said.The accused doctor, from Hindaun in Karauli district , remained in judicial custody for 40 days before he was granted bail. “The girl had also presented her Class 10 marksheet in which her date of birth is shown as October 10, 2000,” he said.While acquitting the accused, Pocso special judge Dinesh Gupta directed the additional chief secretary (home) to independently inquire and investigate the matter.“If it is found that the police officers involved in this case had done it with mala fide intention and wrongly implicated the doctor, the state government through its conscious decision may further get an FIR registered and refer it to the CBI,” the court order said.“If the policemen, including Maman Singh, the then SP, Sawai Madhopur; the then deputy superintendent of police Narendra Kumar; and the then circle inspector, Sadar police station, Rewar Mal; are found guilty of making a false case, the compensation money should be deducted from their salary,” the order said."

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday imposed a minimum of 25 years in jail on two persons who were concurrently awarded death sentence by trial court and Bombay High Court for the sensational kidnapping and killing of the eight-year-old son of a Nagpur-based dentist couple in 2014.A bench of Justices U U Lalit, Indu Malhotra and Hemant Gupta concurred with the trial court and High Court in finding that the prosecution proved the case beyond doubt about guilt of Arvind Singh and his associate in kidnapping of the innocent boy by posing as an employee of the clinic run by the dentist couple on September 1, 2014 deputing, then demanding ransom and finally murdering the child.However, the bench debated whether the case fell in the 'rarest of rare category' to warrant award of death sentence to the convicts, who were young men who committed the crime driven by the desire to become rich in a short time.Writing the judgment for the bench, Justice Gupta said, ""we find that the accused have taken the life of a young school going boy of only 8 years of age to become rich by ransom and to take vengeance against the doctor. The argument is that since the accused are young, aged about 19 years, and have no criminal antecedents, the sentence of death imposed upon them is not warranted.""""We do not find any merit in the argument that being young or having no criminal antecedents are mitigating circumstances. What is required to be examined is whether there is a possibility of rehabilitation and whether it is the rarest of the rare case where the collective conscience of the community is so shocked that it will expect the holders of judicial power to inflict death penalty irrespective of their personal opinion as regards desirability or otherwise of retaining death penalty. The manner of commission of murder when committed in an extremely brutal, grotesque, diabolical, revolting or dastardly manner are aggravating factors,"" the bench said.""The motive of the accused to take life was to become rich by not doing hard work but by demanding ransom after kidnapping a young, innocent boy of 8 years. Thus, having considered all the circumstances and facts on record, we are of the considered view that the present case falls short of the “rarest of rare” cases where a death sentence alone deserves to be awarded to the appellants,"" it said.While confirming the conviction of the accused, the bench converted the death sentence to life imprisonment, with a caveat that life sentence meant imprisonment for entire life. ""There shall not be any remission till the accused completes 25 years of imprisonment.,"" the SC said."

Of late, he had been targeting Bangladeshis coming to Kolkata legally. He befriended Bangladeshi traders, like the latest victim Bosir Mia (39), mostly in New Market and Sealdah hotels. After winning their confidence, he would take them to Basanti. He would then enact a scene whereby the victim and he would be kidnapped.

The film revolves around the practice of pakadwa shaadi, in which grooms are abducted and married off at gun-point. The practice is only prevalent in parts of North India, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, in particular.

When we met the actress recently, we asked her, hypothetically, if she would like three men from show business across the world to be kidnapped, who would in turn, can contest for her hand in marriage. The actress came up with an interesting response. She told us, “It’s difficult to imagine these things even as hypothesis. If I really had to get people kidnapped for myself, I would probably like Bradley Cooper, Saif Ali Khan and Ranbir Kapoor. And since we are talking hypothetically, it might be interesting to get Sidharth Malhotra to kidnap these guys because his character Abhay kidnaps grooms in our film. He can extend his reel part to reality; afterall he knows the tricks.”

When asked why she’d like the actors she’s mentioned to be kidnapped for her, Parineeti laughs and says, “I’m a huge fan of their work and I like them a lot.”"

NOIDA: A 68-year-old protocol officer with a private college and photographer who shoots for Delhi Police was allegedly abducted by a gang of four early morning last Saturday in Noida’s central business district.Joginder Sharma was robbed but fortunately had an identity card issued by Delhi Police in his pocket, which the abductors spotted and panicked.

NAGPUR: Refusing any leniency to a two time Congress MLA Anant Gedam, who had allegedly kidnapped fellow contestant before the Maharashtra assembly polls , the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court rejected his anticipatory bail plea while slamming him for indulging in undemocratic activities The HC tersely noted that Bramhapuri MLA Vijay Wadettiwar , who’s also leader of opposition on outgoing assembly, had tried to convince Gedam on releasing complainant Badhuji Tadam, but he didn’t pay heed to his advice. Both Gedam and Tadam had filed nominations for MLAs seat from Armori constituency in Naxal infested Gadchiroli. While former was granted ticket by Congress, latter was contesting as an independent candidate.“Gedam tried to silence the voice of a competitor who wishes to contest the election as an independent, so that he wouldn’t be able to contest by indulging into such acts which are against law. He thereby tried to pollute the sacrosanct process of election for electing representative of people from Armori,” justice Vinay Deshpande noted.The judge added that the petitioner, including Gedam and Jeevan Patil, appear to be the influential persons. “If their custodial presence isn’t given to the police machinery, there is every possibility that they will tamper the prosecution case. Looking at the fact that the applicants can influence the course of investigation, I am of the opinion that this isn’t the case wherein HC should exercise its discretion under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) in favour of the persons who bent upon to see that the democracy should not shape in proper way,” he ruled.Gedam’s son had kidnapped Tadam on October 9 and later he himself joined and threatened the complaint. He then called Wadettiwar, who himself came to the spot and advice Gedam to release Tadam.After Tadam was released the next morning, he lodged a complaint with Armori Police Station and an offence was registered under Sections of IPC and Representation of People Act, 1951. Gedam filed an anticipatory bail plea through senior counsel Anil Mardikar in the HC contending that since election is over Gedam’s custodial presence was not required.“Since Gedam is an ex-MLA, it can be fairly said that he was being aware of how the election has to be conducted in transparent and in clean atmosphere. In spite of that, it appears that he abducted Tadam, who according to him might have affect his chances of winning. After a word of advice from Wadettiwar, it was expected that he could have released the complainant, but he did otherwise,” the HC said."

CHENNAI: A five-year-old boy who was kidnapped from outside a Tasmac bar in Oragadam where his father lay drunk on Wednesday was rescued in Ambattur on Thursday evening with the help of CCTV camera footage.Police, who handed over the rescued Kumaraguru to his father Guruprasad, 35, are now trying to trace the owner of the Ambattur house where he was found. A senior officer said construction workers Guruprasad and his wife Muruguammal, 30, residents of Palur near Oragadam in Kancheepuram district, had two children, including a two-month-old boy. While Muruguammal was recuperating at her mother’s house after the second child’s birth their elder child was with Guruprasad.Around noon on Wednesday, Guruprasad took his son to the Tasmac shop four km from their house and left him at the entrance, promising to return soon.A little while later, Guruprasad came out drunk and went to sleep on the floor.The little boy made futile attempts to wake up his father and then stood waiting by his side, not knowing what to do, said the officer. Around four hours later, Guruprasad woke up from his drunken stupor and found his son missing. He began a frantic search and asked a few shopkeepers in the area but all of them said they had not seen the boy go with anyone.Guruprasad then filed a complaint with the Oragadam police who registered a case and formed a team to trace the boy.After CCTV camera footage from the Tasmac outlet showed a man in a dhoti and a shirt taking the boy, police launched a hunt. Meanwhile, they received information about the boy being kept at a house in Ambattur. The team rushed there.“The boy was alone,” said an investigating officer. “The child was not able to reveal anything about the man except saying that he fed him and took care of him,” said the officer. Police said they were yet to ascertain why the boy was taken away.In Video: Chennai: Boy kidnapped as dad sleeps in bar, rescued"

UJJAIN: In a bizarre act of crime in Shajapur district , thieves have stolen buffaloes from a farm and demanded lakhs of rupees from the owner to return them safe and sound. This is the second such case of ‘kidnapping’ and the gang has set a higher ransom this time.“They have been abducted!” a menacing voice told dairy farm owner Angoorbala Hada over phone in a latenight call, nearly a month ago. “This time, you have to pay a bigger ransom,” it said, jolting the single mother out of sleep. She has several heads of Murrah breed buffaloes — each costing Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 2 lakh — on her farm near Muradpura Hanuman temple . She recalls the chilling call she got on the intervening night of June 25 and 26, 2018. The gang had taken away five of her precious Murrah breed. Ransom calls were made through intermediaries — people known in the locality.Hada filed a complaint with Shajapur Kotwali police station, but before the cops could act, the kidnappers told her that they would “settle for a deal”. “Through a neighbour, I was led to a man who I paid Rs 1.35 lakh for the release of my buffaloes,” the dairy owner told TOI. She was told to collect the buffaloes near Karedi Naka, a day after the ransom was paid.Almost exactly a year later, on June 28 this year, she found four buffaloes missing. Also missing was a high-end CCTV surveillance system she had installed after last year’s theft.When she contacted her old sources, she was told that such ‘abductions’ were inevitable, and she had better pay up. Refusing to buckle under pressure, she approached police with recordings of the conversations she had with the abductors on phone. Police say Hada isn’t the only one whose cattle are being held to ransom these days. Unlike her, however, many of the victims quietly pay up rather than go to police. “Usually, the victims don’t turn up at the police station. The two groups strike a compromise. The matter is never reported,” Shajapur SP Pankaj Shrivastava said. Kotwali police have registered a case of trespass and theft and are investigating Hada’s complaint, he said.In Video: MP criminals take to buffalo kidnapping for making quick bucks"

CHENNAI: In a cat-and-mouse game in which the mouse seems to have outsmarted the cat, a gang on Tuesday allegedly kidnapped two women passengers, who were taken by air customs sleuths to a hospital to retrieve smuggled gold, in a car in Chromepet.According to sources, the women were suspected to have swallowed 30 capsules each stuffed with gold granules which may totally weigh more than a kg. The duo, who reappeared before the customs officials on Wednesday, claimed that a gang kidnapped them, took them to a private hospital, and removed the gold from them after giving them a stomach wash . They also claimed that they were not smugglers, but were only carriers of gold. The Pallavaram police have filed a case and are searching for the gang, while the customs officials are questioning the women to track down the kidnappers.Customs officials in their complaint said the women were abducted by the henchmen of smugglers as they were walking into the hospital. Police, however, said CCTV camera footage lifted from the scene did not show any such drama. The police have filed a case under charges of obstructing a government servant from performing duty.Police said the CCTV camera footage shows the customs officials and the women walking into the hospital, a car entering the campus, and the women getting into it. Customs officials said they tried to give chase, but the car sped away. The two women, identified as Teresa and Fathima, landed from Colombo on Tuesday. Air customs officials stopped them after they found something abnormal in the way they were walking with their bloated bellies. A body check in the screening room revealed that they were smuggling gold, and the women confessed that they had swallowed gold pellets.Based on the complaint of the customs officials, the Pallavaram police have registered a case under IPC Section 353 (punishment for the use of criminal force against a public servant to deter from serving the duty). An investigation officer said, “Customs are investigating smuggling; we are focusing on the case we have slapped on the suspects.”"

Trichy: An AIADMK functionary along with his gang kidnapped a woman professor in an ambulance with an intention to marry her but developed cold feet midway and left her on the outskirts of Trichy on Monday. The accused, Somu alias ‘Vanakkam’ Somu, 38, Rockfort zone treasurer of the party, and five others were yet to be arrested.They abducted professor Priyaranjini (name changed), 32, of North Street in Rockfort when she was on her way to college nearby in the morning. The gang pulled her into the ambulance when she was walking on North Andal street with a woman relative. When the relative and local people tried to catch the abductors, the vehicle sped away.As word reached her mother, she informed Fort police which in turn alerted all checkposts in the city and the outskirts to intercept the ambulance. However, the police team at the station was clueless about the direction in which the ambulance moved.While the search was on, they got information that the gang had dropped the professor near Thuvarankurichi on the Trichy-Madurai road and escaped. Subsequently, the police team reached there and talked to the shaken professor. Preliminary inquiry brought to light that Somu was married and had two children.However he developed a liking for Priyaranjini and wanted to marry her also. Somu met her mother in this regard and sought her daughter’s hand in marriage. But the woman not only turned down the proposal but also reprimanded him.Disappointed at this, he conspired with his accomplices to kidnap Priyaranjini. In order to avoid being caught, they arranged a private ambulance and had been waiting for an opportunity to kidnap her near Andal street for the past few days.Usually, Priyaranjini and her friend, a woman professor, would go to college on a moped . On Monday, since a tyre of the two-wheeler got punctured, she had to walk towards the college when she was abducted. Inspector Shanmugavel said that a case has been registered against Vanakkam Somu and five others and they were hot on their trail."

KOLHAPUR: The Ichalkaranji police have arrested four suspects for the alleged kidnap and rape of a 9-year-old girl. They were produced before the local court on Wednesday, and the court sent them to six-day police custody.The arrested men have been identified as Rohit Gajanan Jadhav, Sourav Makardhwaj Mane, Shubham Nitin Gokhale and Shakib Abdul Sheikh — all residents of Ichalkaranji, aged between 19 to 21 years.Srinivas Ghadage, the additional superintendent of police, Ichalkaranji division, said, “The incident took place early on Monday morning. The victim was bursting firecrackers outside her house at around 5 am when the four motorcycle-borne suspects approached her and kidnapped her. They took her at an abandoned place, raped her and fled.”According to police, passers-by spotted the girl crying, and then informed her parents. Her parents rushed to the spot, and after hearing her account, took her to Chhatrapati Pramila Raje (CPR) civil hospital. Her father later lodged a complaint with the Shivajinagar police station.“Immediately after we got the information, we launched a search operation for the suspects. Superintendent of Police Abhinav Deshmukh was in Ichalkaranji, and he waited here till the suspects were nabbed. Twelve teams were working under his guidance,” said Ghadage.“The CCTV cameras installed in the city, as a part of the safe city project, provided us with the clues. Some cameras spotted the gang. The footage helped identify the suspects' motorcycles and their trail. Informers also helped us in this case. Following the clues, we managed to catch them,” he said.“We have booked the suspects under several sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, kidnap and rape,” he said.“The victim is out of danger and is recovering,” he added.“Of the four suspects, three are criminals on police record and they were booked for crimes like theft and robbery in police stations in Ichalkaranji and vicinity,” said a senior police officer.Ichalkaranji was shocked by the incident and several delegations visited the police station and demanded speedy arrest of the suspect. After the arrests were made, people gathered in huge crowd outside the court and demanded stern action against the culprits. Heavy police force was stationed outside the court and the police station to avoid any untoward law and order incident."

MUMBAI: A special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act court on Wednesday gave three men a ten-year sentence for kidnapping and sodomizing a 14-year-old boy in 2013. Convicting Vicky Chindalia (27), Sunil Chindalia (27) and Deepak Chindalia (29) on charges of aggravated penetrative sexual assault , the court said that children are soft targets of sexual violence and are thus extremely vulnerable.The boy deposed in court that Vicky stopped him when he was on his way home from tuition class on December 10, 2013, and made lewd comments. Vicky threatened to beat him up, dragged him to a 'maidan' nearby, forced him to climb the gates and took him inside the watchman's cabin. He said Vicky then sexually assaulted him. Deepak arrived and sodomised him, after which Sunil came and took photographs of him. Sunil threatened to make the photos public if he did not return to the same spot every day. Sunil then sexually assaulted him, he said.The boy heard his brother calling for him, which prompted the three to ask him to hide. The boy ran out of there. His mother was at the gate of the maidan, and he narrated the incident to her. The boy's family then filed a police complaint. The trio was arrested on December 11, 2013 and granted bail in 2018.In a detailed copy of the judgment, the court quoted Nelson Mandela saying, ""Safety and security don't just happen, they are the result of collective consensus and public investment. We owe our children, the most vulnerable citizens in our society, a life free of violence and fear."" Keeping these principles in mind, and the impact of child sexual abuse which is devastating for survivors, it was of the view that the sentence would meet the ends of justice, the court said.The court directed the District Legal Aid Services to provide guidance to the parents of the boy."

BHOPAL: In a chilling reminder of the 12-hour hostage crisis of July 2018, a 22-year-old man drove all the way from Buldhana in Maharashtra to Bhopal — a distance of 450km — on Tuesday to abduct a 16-year-old girl he claims to be in love with. He stabbed her grandfather and maternal uncle, and assaulted her grandmother when they tried to save the teenager.The quick response of a Dial 100 team prevented it from getting worse. The accused, Shubham Sabkar, is in police custody, where he has so far refused to say anything apart from threatening to commit suicide. He had slit his wrists after the failed attempt to kidnap the schoolgirl, but was saved by police.It brought back memories of the crazed stalker from Mumbai, Rohit Singh, who barged into a former model’s home in Bhopal in July 2018, stabbed her in the neck and stonewalled police for 12 hours as she lay bleeding. It was sheer luck that she survived. He is still behind bars.While Singh had taken a train to Bhopal, Shubham drove 12 hours with a friend from Buldhana in Amravati district and showed up at the girl’s doorstep in Kolar on Tuesday. She was taken unawares when Shubham barged in, around 3.30pm, and started dragging her out. Hearing her screams, her grandfather came running and tried to grapple with him. Shubham allegedly pulled out a knife and stabbed him twice. As the elderly collapsed, his wife — the teen’s grandmother — stepped up although she is frail and ailing.Shubham allegedly pushed her to the floor and kept dragging the girl out. By sheer luck, her maternal uncle arrived and gave him a fight. In the scuffle, the girl broke free and ran back into the house. Enraged, Shubham stabbed him as well, and again lunged for the 16-year-old.By then, neighbours had come out and rushed to her aid. Someone had already dialled 100 and a patrol team responded within minutes. Seeing himself outnumbered, Shubham cut his left wrist. Duty officer ASI Asharam Marskole pounced on him and wrestled the knife from him.Police took him and the two men he had stabbed to hospital. SHO Kolar Anil Bajpai said that the man who had driven Shubham to Bhopal sped away on seeing the police. Patrol teams are out looking for him.The 16-year-old has told police that she only knew Shubham as a friend of her brother, and no more. Police have booked Shubham for abduction and assault with a knife."

PATNA: A 15-year-old girl from Jamui district was kidnapped and subsequently raped for three days by a boy from the same village. Her parents finally traced the girl to a place in neighbouring Lakhisarai district where she was allegedly confined and subjected to sexual exploitation.The victim, a Class IX student at a government school, was kidnapped while returning home from her school under Sikandara police station area in Jamui district on the Teacher’s Day on September 5. She was later taken to a place in Lakhisarai district and the boy, stated to be a minor, confined her in a room and raped the girl for three consecutive days.The victim’s father, a farmer, kept on running from pillar to post to get his minor daughter rescued from the clutches of her tormentor . “Finding no way out, I decided to take the help of some villagers to trace my daughter as the accused belonged to the same village,” the hapless father said.On Monday, the survivor’s family somehow traced the house near Lakhisarai railway station and recovered the girl safely. The tormentor, stated to be a minor, returned home late on Monday night, but he was arrested by the Sikandara police. He was later produced before the Juvenile Justice Board, which sent him to the child care centre (remand home).Sikandara SHO Raghvendra Kumar said on Tuesday that the accused has been arrested and booked under section 366 A of IPC and relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Exploitation (POCSO) Act, 2012. The victim was sent to Jamui sadar hospital for medical examination. “The medical report has confirmed the rape,” he said.The SHO said the girl’s statement was recorded in the court under Sections 161 and 164 of CrPC. “As the accused has already been arrested, the chargesheet against him will be submitted in the court soon. The police have enough evidence to get the offender punished by the court of law,” the SHO told this newspaper over phone on Tuesday.The police, however, claimed that the accused had love affair with the victim. The accused earlier studied with the rape survivor in a local government school. The victim’s family, however, dismissed the allegation that the girl had fallen in love with the accused. “The local police are trying to hush up the case by declaring the accused a minor, which is not the case,” the girl’s father alleged."

KATHARIYA VILLAGE (FARRUKHABAD): Subhash Batham, a murder convict who held a fake birthday party for his daughter in UP’s Farrukhabad and then held 25 children who were his “guests” hostage for several hours, was shot dead by police early on Friday morning.His wife, Ruby, who was allegedly an accomplice to the act, died in a hospital soon after after angry local residents pelted her with stones, lynching her. Police on Friday filed an FIR against 300 unknown people under section 302 (punishment for murder).Police, forensic teams and the bomb disposal squad (Moradabad) claimed they had recovered 145 crude bombs, including a cylinder bomb and a can bomb, along with wire, battery, tape, sutali (thread) that they said were used in a bomb hurled by Batham, injuring two dial 112 constables and SHO Mohammdabad.Twenty live cartridges, 11 used cartridges of a country-made pistol and a 315 bore rifle were recovered from his house, police said, along with the used cartridge of an AK-47. Some of the children who had been held hostage had, however, told TOI that they saw only a katta and another country made rifle with Batham.Police said Batham — who never attended school — acquired his ""bomb-making skills"" during a 12-year stint in jail after he was convicted of murder. The basement in which he held the children hostage doubled up as his laboratory where he painstakingly readied the crude bombs, cops added, suggesting he had been planning his act for a long time.But as far as his motives are concerned, there are different theories — anger at the residents for boycotting him for a long time for marrying a Dalit woman; allegedly being left out of government schemes and enmity against those who testified against him in court in the murder case.According to police, Batham had claimed on the night of the incident that the gram pradhan of Kathariya village and a local MLA had falsely implicated him in his uncle’s murder due to which he had ended up wasting his youth in prison. The gram pradhan, Harvir Singh, told TOI that he indeed testified in court against Batham and that’s why the man held enmity against him. “Batham murdered his uncle in 2001 after he had caught him stealing valuables from a neighbour’s house and scolded him. I was a witness in the case.”Commenting on a letter that Batham had written to authorities — demanding a house and toilet under government schemes — and which he handed to police on Thursday night, the gram pradhan said his demands were baseless. “He had written the letter for a house under the PM Awas Yojana and a toilet under Swachh Bharat Mission years ago.” The real motive, he insisted, was revenge against him and village residents.Bhojpur MLA Nagendra Singh — who was also the target of Batham’s fury — said that he didn’t know the man but had visited the spot to calm down the situation. “He wanted revenge as he was boycotted by the community for marrying a Dalit woman four years ago,” he said.Anil Kumar Mishra, SP (Farrukhabad), said, “The hostage situation could have been created to extort money as he demanded Rs 1 crore for each kid. He also wanted all criminal cases expunged against him.” Batham had five criminal cases going on against him in local courts.Whatever the motive, he was well prepared, claimed police. “The quantity of bombs was good enough to kill everyone in a radius of 50m if they went off at once,” said Farrukhabad special operation group in charge, Dinesh Kumar Gautam.Batham was shot even as the crowd of 300 pelted stones at their house. “As they were attacking the couple at the front door, we entered the house from the back. When he saw his wife being attacked, he grabbed his country-made rifle after which he was shot dead,” said Mishra.Some residents, however, alleged that policemen “encouraged local residents to pelt stones at the couple”. On Friday, the couple’s bodies were sent for autopsy, while their two-and-a-half-year-old daughter Kusum was handed over to child authorities."

KATHARIYA VILLAGE, FARRUKHABAD: When 25 children in UP’s Farrukhabad district entered Subhash Batham’s house on Thursday evening, apart from the missing confetti there was little indication that this wasn’t, in fact, a birthday party. They were welcomed by Batham’s wife into a 10 x 8 basement where several packets of snacks, biscuits, chocolates and milk were kept.The cold, mud floor was covered in mats for the kids to sit on. In the ensuing 10 hours in which the crisis unfolded, Batham and his wife reportedly took turns to check up on the kids, with the latter even serving them roti and sabzi.For these children in Kathariya village, most of whom were aged between one and 15, a birthday invite was as rare as it was alluring. Many hail from poor households, with their parents struggling to make ends meet. So when word spread around on Thursday afternoon that a party was to be held, they were eager to join the celebrations. Their parents too felt there was little reason to worry.Batham had a chequered past — he had spent 12 years in prison for killing his uncle — but he hadn’t displayed aggressive behaviour towards anyone in the village and as one villager said, “It had been years since that incident in 2001.” But within hours, as news came that Batham was armed and making demands to release the children, parents started assembling in front of the house, fearing the worst. Inside, the children were anxious but well-fed.A day later, many of the children TOI spoke to said they were still shocked with the turn of events but happy to be back home.The younger ones, however, showed little understanding that they had been at the centre of a raging drama that had everyone on tenterhooks. But most seemed to agree on one thing — their kidnapper was not out to harm them. “I don’t believe he (Batham) wanted to harm us. He warned us to keep quiet and said there would be consequences if we didn’t, but he didn’t hurt anyone,” said Anjali Kumari, the eldest among those who had been held hostage. Batham had a pistol and a rifle with him, said the children, but he never pointed it at them.On Friday, when TOI visited the spot, candy wrappers were strewn across the basement. Instead of a staircase, a ladder paved the way to the dingy space bereft of windows, with an LED bulb the only source of light. A metal door separated the basement from the rest of the house. It was this door that Anjali bolted shut after the children had been stuck in the room for hours and their patience started wearing thin. This cut off Batham’s access to the children and minimised their chances of getting caught in a crossfire. “After I locked the door, Subash uncle and his wife banged on the door several times, but I didn’t open it. Two hours later, we were rescued by police,” said Anjali.While initially scared, the children said they felt better once food was served. Arun Kumar, 10, said that the couple served everyone food and water. “We were given biscuit, chocolate, milk, water and some ate roti and sabzi. But when we wanted to pee, we were told to go in a corner and relieve ourselves,” added Soni Kumari, 12, who was confined along with two of her siblings. As there wasn’t much to do, some of the children went to sleep.When an infant wouldn’t stop crying, Batham decided to go outside to release her. That’s when Anjali shut the door from inside. The children didn’t have to wait long though. A couple of hours, later, police made their way to the building and shot Batham dead.Residents of the quiet village said they were still coming to terms with the incident that had shoved them into the limelight. But things could have turned out differently, said Babli Devi, whose house is next to Batham’s. “Three of my children were in there too. And I will always remember this traumatic night but would I have wanted them dead for it? I don’t think so. Perhaps, police could have caught Batham, instead of killing him.”A police officer said, “We negotiated with Batham for hours and went into the building to arrest him, but he brandished a gun. So we had to shoot.”In Video: Farrukhabad hostage drama: Unaware of trap children wanted to enjoy party"

FARRUKHABAD: Local residents claim there was a method to the madness of Subhash Batham , the man who heldwith police shooting him down and a mob lynching his wife.Villagers said the hostage-taking appeared to have been planned. Batham, who was out on bail for a year and a half in a 2001 murder case, had invited the children for his daughter's birthday party.Kanpur inspector general Mohit Agarwal, who led the police team in the rescue operation, said Batham had accumulated some weapons and country-made bombs and may have planned to blow up the house.The hostage drama started before 6 pm on Thursday and ended well past midnight.Batham apparently kept the children confined to the basement of his home till police and local residents barged in.As local people and policemen laid siege to the house in Kasaria village, the 40-year-old initially demanded that the cases against him be dropped.""Batham was demanding withdrawal of a murder case and we assured that we will talk about it. When we told him that he would be provided a government house, his wife Ruby shouted back, ‘give Rs 1 crore for each child and only then they will be released',"" Agarwal said.During the siege, Batham also sent out a letter addressed to the district magistrate, local people said.In the letter, he reportedly complained that he was not allowed to make use of government schemes for housing and building toilets at home. He also alleged that he was being troubled by the Special Operation Group of police.In 2001, he had allegedly stabbed another villager, Meghnad, to death in a dispute over a drain. He was also accused in three robbery cases.According to local people, Batham had sold off his four-bigha piece of land and had no regular income.Though they accepted the invitation to the birthday party for their children, the villagers described Batham as mentally unstable and claimed that people generally kept away from him.Around 1 am, police barged into Batham's house. Villagers claimed that they too went in around the same time.While Batham was shot dead by police, local people caught hold of his wife, thrashing her and pelting stones at her, police said.Superintendent of police Anil Kumar Misra said she was initially rushed to a local hospital and later referred to Lohia hospital. She succumbed to her injuries there.All children were rescued safely from the basement, police said.The 23 children are aged between six months and 15 years."

AURANGABAD: The families of serving police personnel, who had moved into the newly constructed flats on the premises of the city police commissionorate, have been facing erratic water supply.Now, many families are unwilling to continue living on the premises as they do not get regular water supply . They are forced to buy drinking water on a daily basis.The city police had built smart houses for the staff in multi-storey buildings. There are 10 apartment buildings on the premises and each of these buildings has 28 2BHK flats. The process of allotting the flats was initiated in September 2019.The storage capacity of the water tank is 5.60 lakh litre and as per the calculation of 1,000 litre/family, the water released by civic body is sufficient for only one day. Currently, there are about 500 families including those of constables, head constables, assistant sub-inspectors, police sub-inspectors and assistant police inspectors residing in these apartments.Residents said the water supply was normal for the first one month, but things changed drastically soon after. The civic officers ignored the pleas of the senior police officers. The families have been asked to use water judiciously and also store it.A resident of the B wing said, “We get water only once in five days. It is difficult for us. People want the police to be on duty for 24 hours, but don’t we deserve regular water supply at least.”She said that due to lack of water, they are struggling with their household work.A policeman, who is lives in one of the flats, said that for the past several days, he had to go to office without taking a bath.Residents unanimously said that they are being forced to purchase drinking water. “After getting stressed out on the field, we reach home only to face water woes,” said a head constable.The women members of the families gathered for a recent haldi-kunku event organised by the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters) Meena Makwana, and expressed their anger before the officer.When contacted, DCP Makwana first tried hushing up the matter by terming it to be an internal matter. Later, she expressed her helplessness in being able to address the issue.She told TOI, “After the water supply department engineers did not respond to our requests, the matter has been brought to the notice of the commissioner of police, who is personally following the matter up with the Aurangabad municipal commissioner.”The officer said the water supply department authorities have asked to adjust the lines of rest of the city, which too, on an average, gets water once in five days.An officer privy to the issue said that senior police officers including DCP headquarters is upset as the water supply engineer, who is in charge of the area did not bother to answer her phone calls."

NEW DELHI: “This institution is not hostage of government,” the Supreme Court said on Monday as it sought reply from the Centre on a plea seeking direction to authorities to allow migrant workers across the country to return home after conducting coronavirus tests.The top court's remark came after advocate Prashant Bhushan told the court that the government's view is being blindly considered without verifying it, while fundamental rights of people especially migrant workers are not being enforced.A bench of Justices N V Ramana, Sanjay Kishan Kaul and B R Gavai questioned Bhushan, appearing for petitioners Jagdeep S Chhokar, former director in-charge of IIM, Ahmedabad, and lawyer Gaurav Jain, and said as to why should the court hear him, if he does not have faith in the system.Bhushan said that this is an institution created by Constitution but the fundamental rights are being violated of these migrant workers and I am entitled to express by anguish.The bench told Bhushan, “You don't have faith in judiciary. This institution is not hostage of government.""Clarifying that he never said that he has no faith in this system, Bhushan added he could be wrong but similar opinion is expressed by some retired judges.The bench told him that he claims to be practising in the apex court for past 30 years and then he must know that some orders are favourable and some are not and therefore he should not say such things.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for Centre told Bhushan that he should not be under the impression that he is the only one who is concerned with enforcement of fundamental rights.He said the government is very much concerned with the issue and trying to provide all possible help to migrant workers.Bhushan said that if there was any objection with regard to his appearance as a lawyer in the case, then he was willing to withdraw from the matter and some other lawyer will appear.The bench said that it had never asked him to withdraw from the matter.Bhushan said the central government seems to have shut its eyes and should consider the distress situation faced by the migrant workers during the lockdown.He said that more than 90 per cent migrant workers have not received the ration or wages; they are in desperate situation and should be allowed to go to their native places.Mehta however said that these are incorrect reports and questioned the basis of the data given by the petitioners.He said the Centre is consulting states on the issue as to how many of migrant workers have to be transported, how many have to be given help and what kind of help.The bench told Mehta that it means that Centre is in consultation with states and is ready to examine the issue.Mehta replied that the government is examining everything but the ideas of petitioner are not required and urged the court to not keep the petition pending as there are already several pleas, which have similar prayers.Bhushan urged the court to allow inter-state transportation of migrant workers which was objected to by Mehta saying that it is for the government to look into all aspects keeping the larger interest of people in mind.The solicitor general requested the court to not issue notice and give directions on the plea as it would send wrong message and instead he would file a reply within two weeks.The bench said it is giving one week time to Centre to respond whether there is any proposal on allowing inter-state transportation of migrant workers.Meanwhile, the top court disposed of intervention applications filed by advocate Alakh Alok Srivastava on the issue of stopping inter-state migration of workers and said that it is the Central government to look into the issue.The top court said it is not the coordinating agency between the Centre and states, and the Union government has to take necessary action in this regard.Chhokar and Jain in their plea had said that in wake of the extension of the nationwide lockdown, the migrant workers who are among the worst affected category of people must be allowed to go back to their homes after being tested for Covid-19 It said that those migrant workers who test negative for Covid-19 must not be forcefully kept in shelters or away from their homes and families against their wishes.It said that although the national lockdown has been necessitated because of the unprecedented pandemic of Covid-19 and its imposition is much needed, it is submitted by the petitioners that the fundamental right of the migrant workers enshrined under Article 19(1)(d) (right to move freely throughout India) and Article 19(1)(e) of the Constitution (right to reside and settle in any part of India) cannot be suspended for an indefinite period.It said that these migrant workers cannot be forced to stay away from their families and living in unpredictable and arduous conditions, as the same is an unreasonable restriction beyond what is envisaged under Article 19(5) of the Constitution.The petition said that necessary transport services may be provided by the state governments in abundance so that the purpose of 'social distancing' is not defeated."

NEW DELHI: Following a surgery , 48-year-old Mohammed Umar was a ‘medical hostage’ for five days in Apollo Spectra Hospital in Kailash Colony . The hospital refused to let him leave till the bill was paid and continued to bill him for the period of his compelled admission.Umar’s family had made it clear to the hospital at the outset that they could not afford the surgery. The hospital assured them that it would arrange for approval from his insurance company and initially claimed it had got approval. But post-surgery, the management said the insurance company had declined payment, and so they would not let him leave till he paid up.A Delhi High Court order in April 2017 had said hospitals “cannot keep patient hostage” for unpaid bills.After a “bladder neck incision” surgery on August 11, Umar was to be discharged the next day. However, he was detained till August 16 when the insurance company’s payment approval came through. Meanwhile, the hospital continued to add Rs 1,000 per day for admission in the general ward.In response to queries from TOI, an Apollo Spectra spokesperson claimed the patient was not detained and that “at the time of scheduled discharge the insurance company wanted some clarification about the operation. They also wanted to visit the patient in hospital for physical verification. Since the patient was on catheter and not very literate, we took the opportunity of this period for better care of the catheter,” stated the spokesperson. Umar’s son Imran said this was a lie because the insurance agent had already visited them in the hospital on August 10 to verify documents, meet the doctor and take his father’s signature on documents.Umar, a security guard, had difficulty in passing urine. On Aug 7, he consulted a laparoscopic surgeon who asked him to come to Apollo Spectra Hospital where he operated. The family had already spent Rs 3,000 on investigations including an ultrasound, which revealed bladder outlet obstruction. When informed of the surgery’s cost, Imran told the surgeon they could not afford it. Imran also told him they had an insurance policy. “I repeatedly stressed that we had no money and the hospital staff and the doctor assured me that the surgery would be done only after approval from the insurance company,” said Imran.On August 10, he was told the approval had come through and Umar was admitted by evening. The surgery was done the next day and Imran was told his father would be discharged on August 12. However, on the 12th, which happened to be Eid, Imran was told the insurance company had declined payment and asked to clear the bill. When Imran called the surgeon for help, he said he was going abroad and there was nothing he could do. He asked Imran to talk to the insurance company. The hospital said the approval process was underway and refused to discharge Umar without payment.At around 10 pm on August 14, Umar and his wife were forced out of the general ward and made to sit at the reception. “They were told they could not sit around in the ward without paying the bill and were harassed and insulted,” said Imran. Imran rushed back to the hospital on hearing this. When the hospital staff continued to misbehave, he dialled 100. The policemen who arrived warned the hospital and ensured Umar was taken back to the ward. They advised the family to speak to “senior management” the next day.“But the next day was Independence Day and no seniors were available,” said Imran. He sought help from Malini Aisola of the Campaign for Dignified and Affordable Healthcare who reached the hospital on August 16 with a lawyer. She too was told the patient could not leave till the bill was settled. Finally, the approval came through. “We were told that we have to settle the food bills for August 15 and 16, which we did before we left,” said Imran.“The hospital was taking advantage of the family’s helplessness and perceived lack of power. In spite of repeatedly being told that detaining the patient was illegal, the hospital did not relent. Patients in such situations are often exploited with insurance company, doctors and hospitals allying against them,” said Aisola.Umar had sought a copy of his medical records — reports of investigations, doctors’ notes, operative notes and treatment chart. None of these have been given to the patient though he was charged Rs 400 for medical records. Umar had also asked for a detailed breakup of the Rs 61,000 bill for the surgery but this too was not provided. The hospital claimed in its response that in an insurance tie up it had a single line procedure approval inclusive of all charges and that this was given to the patient along with the discharge summary."

KABUL: Australian university professor Timothy Weeks , who was held captive for three years by the Taliban, arrived Thursday in Qatar in the Middle East to witness the signing of a peace deal between the US and Taliban.The Taliban maintain a political office in Qatar, where Washington 's peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad conducted negotiations over 17 months to come up with the deal being signed Saturday in the capital of Doha.The agreement will open the door for US troops to withdraw from Afghanistan and bring an end to 18 years of war.Weeks was met at the airport by Anas Haqqani, who was freed from an Afghan jail in exchange for Weeks' release as well as American Kevin King.The two men, both professors at the American University of Afghanistan, were kidnapped in the Afghan capital in 2016.

KATHARIYA VILLAGE (FARRUKHABAD): Subhash Batham, a murder convict who held a fake birthday party for his daughter in UP’s Farrukhabad and then held 25 children who were his “guests” hostage for several hours, was shot dead by police early on Friday morning. His wife, Ruby, who was allegedly an accomplice to the act, died in a hospital soon after after angry local residents pelted her with stones, lynching her. Police on Friday filed an FIR against 300 unknown people under Section 302 (murder).Police, forensic teams and the bomb disposal squad ( Moradabad ) claimed they had recovered 145 crude bombs, including a cylinder bomb and a can bomb, along with wire, battery, tape, sutali (thread) that they said were used in a bomb hurled by Batham during the night, injuring two constables.Twenty live cartridges, 11 used cartridges of a country made pistol and a .315 bore rifle were recovered from his house, police said, along with the used cartridge of an AK-47. Some of the children who had been held hostage had, however, told TOI that they saw only a katta and another country made rifle with Batham.Police said Batham — who never attended school — acquired his “bomb-making skills” during a 12-year stint in jail after he was convicted of murder. The basement in which he held the children hostage doubled up as his laboratory where he painstakingly readied the crude bombs, cops added, suggesting he had been planning his act for a long time.But as far as his motives are concerned, there are different theories — anger at the residents for boycotting him for a long time for marrying a Dalit woman, allegedly being left out of government schemes, and enmity against those who testified against him in court in the murder case.According to police, Batham had claimed on the night of the incident that the gram pradhan of Kathariya village and a local MLA had falsely implicated him in his uncle’s murder due to which he had ended up wasting his youth in prison. The gram pradhan, Harvir Singh, told TOI that he indeed testified in court against Batham and that’s why the man held enmity against him. “Batham murdered his uncle in 2001 after he had caught him stealing valuables from a neighbour’s house and scolded him. I was a witness in the case.”Commenting on a letter that Batham had written to authorities — demanding a house and toilet under government schemes — and which he handed to police on Thursday night, the gram pradhan said his demands were baseless. “He had written the letter for a house under the PM Awas Yojana and a toilet under the Swachh Bharat Mission years ago.” The real motive, he insisted, was revenge against him and village residents.Bhojpur MLA Nagendra Singh — who was also the target of Batham’s fury — said that he didn’t know the man but had visited the spot to defuse the situation. “He wanted revenge as he was boycotted by the community for marrying a Dalit woman four years ago,” he said.SP (Farrukhabad) Anil Kumar Mishra said, “The hostage situation could have been created to extort money as he demanded Rs 1 crore for each kid. He also wanted all criminal cases expunged against him.” Batham had five criminal cases going on against him in local courts.Whatever the motive, he was well-prepared, claimed police. “The quantity of bombs was good enough to kill everyone in a radius of 50 metres if they went off at once,” said Farrukhabad special operation group in charge Dinesh Kumar Gautam Batham was shot even as the crowd of 300 pelted stones at their house. “As they were attacking the couple at the front door, we entered the house from the back. When he saw his wife being attacked, he grabbed his country made rifle after which he was shot dead,” said Mishra.Some residents, however, alleged that policemen “encouraged local residents to pelt stones at the couple”. On Friday, the couple’s bodies were sent for autopsy, while their two and a half year old daughter Kusum was handed over to child authorities.In Video: UP Police rescue all 23 kids kept hostage in Farrukhabad, suspect shot down"

SANTINIKETAN: BJP Rajya Sabha member and writer Swapan Dasgupta was forcibly confined to an auditorium at Visva-Bharati in Santiniketan for almost five hours on Wednesday as students protesting against the new citizenship law stood outside, shouting slogans and refusing to let him leave.Dasgupta had vice-chancellor Bidyut Chakrabarty for company inside the auditorium, whose collapsible gate was locked from outside by the protesters.After his ordeal ended, Dasgupta tweeted: ""Drama ends in Visva-Bharati without the confrontation that some protesters desperately wanted.""The siege was reminiscent of the hostility Union minister Babul Supriyo had faced from students at Jadavpur University when he visited the campus for an event on September 19. But unlike Supriyo, who was allegedly manhandled, Dasgupta apparently didn't face any violence.""How does it feel to have a mob attack a peaceful meeting on CAA ...? This is what is happening to a meeting I am addressing at Visva Bharati now. Locked into room now with a howling mob outside, itching for confrontation,"" Dasgupta had tweeted from captivity after some students allegedly scaled a wall and shouted slogans through the windows.The gherao at Visva-Bharati started around 4.30pm and was lifted at 9.25pm, minutes after governor Jagdeep Dhankhar contacted DGP Virendra. ""Such anarchy and failure of law and order are worrisome,"" Dhankhar tweeted.During the protest against Supriyo at JU, the governor had rushed to the south Kolkata campus to escort him out of the campus. ""I had come on an invitation from the university to speak at a lecture series on CAA. This was not a political forum. If someone does this, it only reflects an attitude that goes against the principles of democratic thinking. I had expected the students to participate in the seminar and oppose CAA. It could have been a healthy discussion. Initially, the seminar was planned at Lipika auditorium. But later, the venue was shifted because I was told there were chances of confrontation. But we didn't want any confrontation,"" Dasgupta said.Somnath Sow, an SFI leader, accused vice-chancellor Chakrabarty of precipitating the stand-off. ""The VC organised the seminar on a day the entire country was protesting against CAA-NPR-NRC. He invited Swapan Dasgupta as the sole speaker at the seminar,"" he said.The protesters had assembled at the university's central office hours before the scheduled start of the seminar at 10.30am, locking the gates and hanging posters bearing slogans against PM Narendra Modi and CAA. At 2pm, they moved to the main entrance of the auditorium and blocked the gate before Dasgupta arrived to speak at 3pm. Sensing the mood, the university authorities shifted the venue to an auditorium on the Sriniketan campus, about a kilometre away.The protesters came to know about the venue change 45 minutes later and reached there at 4.30pm. Around 6pm, Visva-Bharati officials tried to persuade the students to disperse, but they wouldn't listen.Suchitra Bhattacharya, a professor in the department of economics and politics, said the situation could have been avoided. ""We had urged the VC to shift the seminar to a different date and invite a panel of speakers instead of just one. The VC didn't pay heed to our request. He only invited Dasgupta.""With the stir continuing into the night, Trinamool functionaries started sending feelers to the Visva-Bharati protesters that being a central university, the CISF was in charge of its security. ""While the VC didn't call CISF to clear the protesters, there was a chance of disturbance and confrontation from the outside,"" a Trinamool leader said.BJP national secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya said in a video message: ""Our Rajya Sabha member Swapan Dasgupta is being held up at Visva-Bharati for hours. Police haven't taken steps as yet. If anything happens to the MP, things will get out of control."""

The couple says the hospital barred them from leaving until they make the payment.Austin said she asked if they could work out a payment plan once they were back in the US, but her request was denied.They claim the hospital locked the doors, a supervisor became physical in restricting them from leaving, and a threat was made to call the police if the couple tried to leave.In an interview from his hospital room, Johnson told he was going through 'hell'.He describes his situation: ""I very much so am a hostage"". His fiancee added: ""It's been a nightmare. We just want to come home.""Austin said that they reached out to the US Embassy in Mexico to no avail.Their families later started a GoFundMe page, but it hardly reached the amount they need to cover the medical bill. Perry apparently caught a wind of the couple's situation and offered to pay it himself.According to source, the 50-year-old comedian/writer/director called up the hospital and gave them his credit card info to cover the tab, but the hospital requested that he wires the money, which he already did.The payment is expected to be accepted by Monday, and Johnson is scheduled to be discharged on Tuesday.There were concerns that Johnson would have to be flown back in a medevac plane, and Perry was prepared to cover the travel expense too. However, it turns out that he will be well enough to fly back in commercial flight."

WASHINGTON: The US on Tuesday welcomed the release of two hostages by the Taliban in Afghanistan , describing it a hopeful sign for efforts to end the decades-long conflict in the country.American Kevin King and Australian Timothy Weeks, both professors at the American University in Kabul, were kidnapped at gunpoint in August 2016. Both men were successfully recovered on Tuesday and are currently receiving medical care and other support from the United States Government.""Both men were successfully recovered this morning, are in the care of the US military, and will soon be reunited with their loved ones,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said.""We pray for the full recovery of both men, who endured significant hardship during their captivity, and wish them well as they reunite with their loved ones in the near future,” White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said.In a statement, Pompeo said the Taliban have indicated that the release of the two professors is intended as a goodwill gesture, which the United States welcomes.""Additionally, we welcome the Taliban's impending release of 10 Afghan prisoners, and the Afghan government's release of 3 Taliban prisoners. We see these developments as hopeful signs that the Afghan war, a terrible and costly conflict that has lasted 40 years, may soon conclude through a political settlement,"" Pompeo said.Both Pompeo and the White House commended Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and the Afghan government for working to strengthen and reform Afghanistan's security forces.""During the past two years, President Ghani extended an offer to talk to the Taliban without preconditions. He also called for a ceasefire during the Muslim holiday of Eid-ul-Fitr in 2018, which the Taliban reciprocated. The public's grateful reaction to that interruption in the violence dramatically illustrated their overwhelming desire for peace,” he said."

AGRA: Four days after a murder convict was shot dead by police to rescue 25 children, a man who tried to mediate during the nine-hour-long stand-off claimed on Tuesday that the abductor wanted punishment for two policemen who “tortured him” in custody in a theft case and sought “sexual favours” from his wife in lieu of his release.When contacted, senior district police officials rejected the charges, but assured a probe into the allegation and the role of the two policemen. Subhash Batham was shot dead on Friday while his wife died hours later on way to hospital after being attacked by locals in Farrukhabad ’s Kathariya village. Batham had organised a birthday party for his daughter and then held 25 children hostage on Thursday.On Tuesday, when TOI contacted Anupam Dubey alias Balloo, who was shot at by Batham while trying to negotiate peace, said: “During my interaction with Batham, he accused two Farrukhabad police constables of torturing him in custody. He also alleged that the policemen had also asked for sexual favours from his wife in lieu of his release in a theft case.”Dubey was approached by Bhojpur MLA Nagendra Singh to talk to Batham during the stand-off. “Everyone present there heard Batham but no one did anything. The entire drama was set up to attract administration’s attention to punish those two policemen,” said Dubey.Additional superintendent of police Tribhuwan Singh said, “Batham planned the entire situation for months to extort money. He demanded Rs 1 crore for each child taken hostage. He constructed a basement in his house months ago and also gathered explosives to target policemen.”"

MEERUT: A three-member team for administering polio drops was allegedly thrashed and held hostage after local residents mistook them for the National Population Register (NPR) data collection team. The incident occurred at Lisari Gate locality on Saturday. However, two of them, including a staff nurse, managed to free themselves and complained to police.Lisari Gate station officer Prashant Kapil said, “We have received the complaint from the medical team and we are in the process of filing an FIR against the culprits for stopping public servants from performing their duty. This is not the first time that such an incident has happened in the area.”According to one of victims Kabir Ahmad Khan, who is an officer of the immunization programme, “The incident occurred in Lakhipura locality of Lisari Gate area where a family opposed the administration of polio drops. As per rule, we have to enter the name of the non-consenting parents in the tally (yellow) register. The moment we asked their names, there was a strong protest and within no time, we were surrounded by a mob. We tried to explain them the purpose of our visit. We even showed them the vaccine box and our IDs, but they didn't listen to us and even manhandled one of our team members. They tore away the register and the local women even held hostage a woman staffer in our team. Later, senior staff along with the WHO field monitors also reached the spot and again tried to explain things to them.”Khan said, “The NPR-NRC anxiety among them is obviously the main issue because one of the youths in the mob even told people not to reveal any details to us because he suspected we were the NPR data collectors . Ever since this issue came up, we have been facing very tough resistance from the local residents. But this time, they turned violent.”"

I informed my senior officials and went to the police station with a colleague in the police jeep.At the police station, I was shown a bill and the police station in-charge asked me to waive off the bill, instructing his subordinates not to let me go. On verification, it was found that the bill had already been waived in the past.

SRIGANGANAGAR/BIKANER: Locusts have damaged crops across an area of at least 3.6 lakh hectares in 10 districts as western Rajasthan continues to reel under the longest and the worst attack of the pest in 60 years.Swirling swarms of the deadly grasshoppers have eaten up 75% of standing crops in the hardest-hit Sriganganagar district, according to assessments by officials and farmers. The other nine affected districts are Hanumangarh, Bikaner, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Jodhpur, Jalore, Sirohi, Nagaur and Churu.The first attacks were reported in May last year, when lakhs of pink locusts flying in from southern Pakistan damaged the kharif crop (July-Sept) in the 10 districts. Now, a major wave of fresh attacks have hit the rabi crop (October-March), leaving farmers devastated.Locals in 60 villages of Sriganganagar and Bikaner visited by TOI said the latest attacks began a fortnight ago.Many farmers said the current attack is the biggest ever seen in the region.Among the crops in the line of attack are wheat, gram, mustard, cumin and taramira (arugula). “Locusts are not eating the entire plant but are chewing the flowers, thereby damaging the crop,” said Shyam Somra of 20KYD village in Bikaner district.“Rajasthan witnessed first locust attack in May 2019 and since then, everyone — including the agriculture department, Locust Control Organisation (LCO) and others — has been merely spraying pesticides. This is the biggest-ever attack. Can’t they find out why the attack is still unstoppable and uncontrollable? If breeding is happening in Pakistan, the state administration should urge the Union government to talk to their Pakistani counterparts to control it,” said Subash Sehgal of Kisan Sangarsh Samiti.K L Gurjar, deputy director at LCO-Jodhpur, has been surveying the damage in villages of Sriganganagar and Bikaner districts. “I think the menace is under control in the state, except for Sriganganagar and Jaisalmer districts. A good monsoon, greenery and moisture have been the reasons behind the excessive presence of locusts this year. We have ample pesticides and are checking their movement to control them while they are settled in non-farming areas,” Gurjar told TOI. Farmers alleged that for the last eight months, the state government had neither completed girdawari (cross assessment report), nor had it taken any effective measures to check the swarms of locusts coming at regular intervals.“I have 75 bighas of land and ever since we witnessed fresh locust attack a fortnight ago, we have been spraying pesticides, playing loud music and doing everything to scare away these devils. Government authorities are merely coming and clicking pictures with their mobile phones,” said Soha Lal Bishnoi, a farmer of 12KND village in Sriganganagar.“Almost 1 lakh hectares in Sriganganagar and nearly 2.6-lakh ha in the remaining nine districts have been affected by locust attacks. We have written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and urged his intervention in expediting the relief process. We demand a compensation of Rs 20,000 per acre to each farmer,” said Sehgal."

SRINAGAR: A four-member medical team tasked with screening a ‘Peer Baba’ (self-styled godman) in Sheikhpora of central Kashmir’s Budgam district was held hostage by his kin on Saturday. During a rescue operation, four cops sustained injuries as the godman’s followers pelted stones on them. The accused Peer Baba and his family members were detained.Block medical officer of Chadoora subdistrict hospital, Dr Shafakat Rasool , had deputed the team to screen the Peer Baba in Sheikhpora’s Wathoora village after receiving information from residents of other villages that his followers would visit him regularly violating social distancing norms amid the nationwide lockdown in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. She was also informed that the godman’s son had travel history.“As soon as our medical team reached the village and entered the godman’s house to examine him, the latter’s family members held the four hostages and even hurled abuses at one of our women doctors who was part of the team. The medical staff called us for help and we immediately alerted police who rushed to their rescue,” Dr Shafakat said.When policemen reached the village to launch a rescue operation, they were chased by the Peer Baba’s followers who, in a bid to deter the exercise, pelted stones on the rescue party. In the ensuing melee, four cops sustained injuries even as the medical team was rescued timely, a police officer said. Chadoora Police detained the godman and his family members and booked them under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) of the IPC.“It is equally encouraging that residents of other villages informed the hospital about the violation of the standard operating procedure and the travel history of the accused’s son,” Dr Shafakat added."

ISLAMABAD: A Pakistani court on Thursday overturned the death sentence of Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh , the British-born terrorist who had been convicted of the 2002 kidnapping and killing of American journalist Daniel Pearl and, before that, spent time in an Indian jail till he was bartered for the hostages of the 1999 Kandahar hijacking.The Sindh high court converted Sheikh’s death penalty into a seven-year jail term and acquitted his three accomplices – Fahad Naseem, Salman Saqib and Sheikh Adil – who had been sentenced to life imprisonment by a trial court.Since Sheikh has been in prison for the past 18 years, his seven-year sentence will be counted from the time he was jailed. ""Omar has already spent 18 years in jail, 11 years more than the punishment given to him. His release orders will be issued soon and he will be out in a few days,"" Khwaja Naveed Ahmed, Sheikh’s counsel, told TOI.In 2002, an anti-terrorism court at Hyderabad in Sindh province had handed the death sentence to Sheikh, a close associate of Jaish-e-Muhammad founder Maulana Masood Azhar , and life term to his accomplices in the abduction and murder of Pearl. The four convicts challenged the decision in the high court. At a hearing last month, the court reserved its judgment on the appeals that were pending before it for the past 18 years.Pearl, who was the South Asia bureau chief of The Wall Street Journal, went missing in January 2002 from the southern port city of Karachi. The US authorities received video footage of his beheading at the American consulate in Karachi. His body was later found in a militant hideout in the port city.Prosecutors said Pearl walked into Sheikh’s trap after being promised an interview with a cleric linked to militancy. Sheikh’s association with jihadist activity dated back to the early 1990s. In 1994, he had been arrested in Delhi for allegedly kidnapping four westerners, including three Britons and an American, from Kashmir.In 1999, while he was still serving a prison sentence, an Indian Airlines plane was hijacked from Kathmandu to Kandahar in Afghanistan. In exchange for the 155 hostages on the plane, Sheikh was freed from jail along with Massod Azhar and Mushtaq Zargar, a Kashmiri militant.Before coming to India to fight for Kashmiri Muslims, Sheikh had been involved in jihadist activity in Bosnia. Born in a conservative London-based Muslim family in 1973, he had dropped out of an undergraduate course in statistics at the London School of Economics to go to Bosnia."

NEW DELHI: An 80-year-old woman and her daughter were drugged, gagged, manhandled and held hostage at gunpoint in their Sarita Vihar house by their newly employed domestic help and two men who then ransacked the house of cash and jewellery worth several lakhs. Later, the two fell unconscious and had to be hospitalised.The daughter, an employee of a private firm, said she hired the help on August 31, two days before the incident, through a placement agency to take care of her mother who had undergone a knee replacement surgery. “Though the girl was initially rejected by us, the agency insisted we keep her for trial for three days, claiming she was an excellent worker,” the daughter told TOI.Police were yet to arrest anyone though the incident had taken place a week ago.TOI is withholding the identity of the mother and daughter as they have requested anonymity for their own security.Sharing the ordeal, the daughter told that on September 2, soon after having lunch prepared by the domestic help, she and her mother went to rest in their room. However, she was woken up by some noise. She saw the help ransacking the house along with the two men, who were armed with a khukri and a pistol. The three attacked her and asked her where the valuables were, warning her she would otherwise be shot.After this, one of the robbers stood guard with a gun while the others went to all the bedrooms, ransacked the entire house and took away all valuables. They also took away the DVR of CCTV cameras installed in the house.“It was only after they had left that I was somehow able to dial 100. By the time police arrived, we were both unconscious from the effects of the sedative which was mixed in the lunch,” the daughter said, adding that she also suffered injuries on her head. The blood reports from hospital also indicated the presence of drugs, police said.In Video: 80-year-old, daughter held hostage, robbed in Delhi's Sarita Vihar"

AMBALA: A number of videos of Indians, purportedly of illegal immigrants wanting to unlawfully cross over to the United States through the Mexico border, have emerged in which they are seen being tortured by unidentified men and forced at gunpoint to ask their families to transfer money. In the videos with TOI, three Indian men, seen locked up in a room, are heard speaking in Hindi with a Haryanvi accent.Two Spanish-speaking men, with their faces covered, are seen assaulting them at gunpoint. Holding a sword-like sharp weapon on their necks, the men are heard asking the Indians to tell their parents to send money as soon as possible. “Money, money… Last warning,” they shout at the Indians.The identities of these Indians have yet not been established and any information about their whereabouts is also unknown. In one of the videos, an Indian youth is heard saying, “Mom and dad, give them money or they will kill us. I beg in front of you, please give them the amount of money they are demanding. They are demanding $10,000 and give them the same.” On October 18, 311 Indians were deported from Mexico after the US government tightened its rules and asked Mexican authorities to thwart illegal entry into the US.These videos have been obtained from several of those who were among the 311 Indians to be deported from Mexico. “The donkers (agents) abroad had tortured them mentally and physically,” one of the deportees said. Requesting anonymity, he told TOI, “The agents in India promised to settle me and my brother in the US for Rs 30 lakh.We paid Rs 25.50 lakh in advance and they took us on a journey towards the US. They took us through aerial route from New Delhi to Quito in Ecuador and then we were made to travel through illegal passage via Tulcan, Turbo, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua Honduras , Guatemala, and Mexico. “In Turbo, Colombia , we were locked in a room and taken on gunpoint and forced to ask our parents to pay the remaining amount of Rs 4.5 lakh to their associated agents in India. My parents went to the house of that agent and paid the remaining amount.”"

COLVA: Chief officer of Margao Municipal Council (MMC) Siddivinayak Naik has lodged a police complaint against Ashraf Pandiyal and others for wrongfully restraining him in his cabin for two hours and obstructing him from carrying out his lawful duties.However, Margao police inspector (PI) Sachin Narvekar said the case is yet to be registered.On Tuesday morning, 40-odd Gandhi market traders led by Rajendra Azgaonkar called on chairperson Babita Prabhudessai and Naik to urge them to immediately resolve their pending issues, including that of vendors selling fruits and vegetables from vehicles which hampers local vendors’ business.The traders told Prabhudessai and Naik that it was earlier decided that other vendors could do business in the Gandhi market till 7.30am, but due to lack of monitoring on the part of the MMC these outside vendors conducted their business in the Gandhi market and also on the old station road, which was causing them losses.They demand that the illegal activity of outside vendors carrying on business at the market beyond the agreed time be stopped.The delegation also brought to the notice of the chief officer that after 9am water supply to toilets in the Gandhi market is stopped, inconveniencing vendors who want to use the toilet facilities. There should be continuous water supply at the market, the delegation told Naik and Prabhudessai.Members of the association also told Naik that some vendors are yet to receive power connections and that the matter be rectified. They cited the resolution adopted in 2001 by the council stating that all vendors would be given power connections.Naik told the traders that the resolution did not have legal weightage as the market committee had adopted the resolution and not the council. He said he would refer the matter to the Directorate of Municipal Administration.Aggrieved by the reply the traders returned to Naiks’ cabin at 6pm and demanded that he issue NOCs to the rest of the vendors for power supply.One of the traders Ashraf Pandiyal told reporters that they had proof that Naik has issued NOCs to four traders earlier and was now changing his stand.Naik denied having issued any NOCs.He said that issuing NOCs based on the market committee’s resolution is ‘ultra vires’ as that resolution has to be endorsed by the standing committee and then ratified by the council resolution and that only then NOCs can be issued."

PATIALA: A day after they held an additional deputy commissioner (ADC) hostage in his office after a controversy broke out over distribution of sewing machines to the needy, nearly 50 sarpanches of the Congress from Mansa reached the New Moti Bagh residence of chief minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday to meet Patiala MP Preneet Kaur.The sarpanches had confined ADC (development) to his office on Friday, after they alleged that the authorities were favouring people associated with MLA Nazar Singh Manshahia, who defeceted from AAP to Congress before Lok Sabha polls, in the distribution of sewing machine macghines. They claimed that names of beneficiaries whose list they had handed over to authorities had not been included in the list.The ADC was freed after intervention by an SP-rank official, who later gave a written complaint to Mansa police chief. Employees of the panchayat department went on a strike after the incident. Led by Mansa District Congress Comittee president Manoj Bala, the Congress sarpanches claimed in their meeting with the MP that Mansa deputy commissioner, ADC and panchayat officers were indulging in corruption and ignoring local Congress leaders.Bala said they officials were acting at the behest of Akali leaders and issues being raised by Congress leaders were being overlooked. She said some local officials were indulging in corruption and demanded that they be transferred out of Mansa. She told TOI that Preneet gave them a patient hearing to them and assured them she would take up the matter with chief minister Amarinder Singh.Mansa administration on Friday organized an event to distribute sewing machines and rickshaws to poor SC families under the Centre’s Special Assistance Scheme where Manshahia was the chief guest. The sarpanches and other local leaders got upset when they noticed that “those associated with Manshahia were being given priority” in the distribution of machines.They accused the ADC (development) of “step-motherly” treatment. They also brought the matter to the notice of Bala, who reached the spot. She asked the officials to address the grievances of the Congress sarpanches, but later she ended up arguing with them. It led to sloganeering at the event and the event turned into chaos. As the protesting Congress workers were raising slogans, the ADC (D) went to his office, where the sarpanches held him hostage.Later, SP Kuldeep Singh Sohi and DSP Baljinder Singh Pannu rushed to the spot and persuaded the protesters to lift the dharna."

BHOPAL: It was a crisis that Bhopal hadn’t dreamed of — and one that its police perhaps weren’t prepared for.Police did succeed in getting the woman out alive from the clutches of a crazed gunman, thanks to the negotiating skills of SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha, but residents of the colony, who had a ringside view of the incident, feel it was allowed to drag on far too long. The woman could have bled to death during the long-drawn negotiations, they pointed out.For starters, police shouldn’t have allowed Rohit Singh to videochat with reporters, said former DG Arun Gurtu. It only ended up feeding his hunger for attention and he milked the crisis as long as he wanted, asking police to shoo away media when he had nothing more to say, and then wanting them back when he missed the limelight.Police should have used jammers, isolated him and carried out the negotiation without media attention, the retired cop said. “They should have involved psychiatrists to negotiate with the hostage-taker. Who would have been held responsible if she had bled to death,” asked Gurtu.Took it slow to ensure girl’s safety: PolicePolice allowed Rohit the upper hand by fulfilling all his demands. Eventually he had his way, ending the drama when he said he would.SP Lodha said their priority was to get the girl out safe. And he succeeded. Residents, whose lives came to a standstill because of the 12-hour showdown, wondered why the SP didn’t arrive earlier and take charge of the situation as he did.Businesswoman Pratiksha Mishra, a resident of the society, said: “Police unnecessarily delayed the matter. If they take so long to tackle an amateur, how will they handle a terrorist?” Swati Joshi, a resident of the same locality, said that her children were locked in the flat because of the media frenzy.Misrod police started on the right note. They arrived quietly and parked their vehicles discreetly so as not to draw attention. But it all went downhill when the hostage taker started video-chatting.A few residents, who had a close-up view of the drama, pointed out some moments when police could have barged into the room and nabbed Rohit. “Instead, police allowed the hostage taker to put up a show. He enjoyed the popularity,” said a resident. The best opportunity was when SI G S Rajput showed great courage to grab Rohit’s pistol. If a few more cops had joined in, the crisis would have been over, said a resident.Specialized units like SDRF and policemen clad in bulletproof vests arrived not until 5pm. SP Lodha said police handled the situation tactically. “He had a pistol and could have harmed the girl. I and other officers counselled him and waited for him to calm down. Police took him into confidence to ensure her safety,” he said."

BHOPAL: “Ma, Rohit has got into the house!” This scream, from a terrified MTech grad and actress, early Friday morning was the start of a 12-hour hostage crisis that Bhopalis had only ever seen on TV.A crazed youth — armed with a pistol, knife and scissors — allegedly stabbed the woman and then locked themselves in her bedroom. As she lay bleeding for hours, Rohit Singh aka Regal indulged in video chats with reporters and police, went live on Facebook with grisly images of the injured girl, demanding they be “shared maximum”, and kept police dancing to his music.Late at night, it turned out that he had plotted it after watching a movie the woman had acted in, say police.Like Bollywood script — the industry he claims to work for — he played his moves and dragged out the crisis exactly as long as he wanted, giving himself up a little after 7pm.The hostage was rescued and admitted to hospital. She gave a statement to police, saying she was threatened at gunpoint. “I had no option but to agree to marry him. But I don’t want to,” she told police.And in an example of how police messed up the entire operation, SP-south Rahul Kumar Lodha told reporters after the rescue: “They are in love and want to marry. There’s nothing wrong in that. They are adults. But the process he (Rohit) used is wrong.” This was after she had been rescued and he didn’t have to play-act to Rohit as earlier.Police allowed Rohit the upper hand by fulfilling all his demands. Eventually he had his way, ending the drama when he said he would. SP Lodha said their priority was to get the girl out safe. And he succeeded. Residents, whose lives came to a standstill because of the 12-hour showdown, wondered why the SP didn’t arrive earlier and take charge of the situation as he did.Businesswoman Pratiksha Mishra, a resident of the society, said: “Police unnecessarily delayed the matter.

Later the four withdrew Rs 1 lakh from his account.They also snatched his wallet containing Rs 15,000, mobile phone charger, earphone, and new clothes and some fruits he had bought, before dumping him near a school in Vijay Nagar in the early hours of Monday.Santosh Kumar Jha, his younger brother, told TOI that Manish was returning from Patna on Sunday. “Seemanchal Express was supposed to reach Ghaziabad around 9.30 pm but it was delayed by three hours. After getting down from the train, he took a cab from outside, but missed noticing a person sitting inside,” he said.“As soon as he boarded the cab, the driver stepped on the gas pedal. Within no time, the person sitting next to the driver pointed a gun at him. A little later, two other persons boarded the vehicle and made my brother sit in the middle. They had guns and knives and started beating my brother. He was forced to part with his debit cards and the passwords. They mainly hit him on his hands and knees,” Santosh added.The ordeal continued for over three hours. Around 3.30am, Manish was thrown out of the vehicle near Jindal Public School. In a badly bruised condition, he sought help from a passerby who told him to wait for the police patrolling vehicle. After covering a considerable distance on foot, Manish finally spotted a police patrolling bike and narrated the crime to cops.Based on his complaint, an FIR under IPC 392 (robbery) was lodged at Vijay Nagar police station.SP (city) Shlok Kumar said teams have been formed to investigate the case. “Noida police have also been informed as money was withdrawn from Noida ATMs as well,” he said.Similar crimes were reported in Ghaziabad in March this year too. A 30-year-old dentist was robbed by four persons in an auto-rickshaw, including the vehicle driver, while she was returning from her clinic in Vaishali. She was thrashed and kept inside the moving vehicle for around 45 minutes. They had gagged her mouth after blindfolding her and tying her hands and legs with ropes."

Their mortal remains were exhumed and sent to Iraq's capital Baghdad for DNA sample verification ""Yesterday, we got information that DNA samples of 38 people have matched and DNA of the 39th person has matched 70 percent,"" she said.In July last year, Swaraj firmly said in Parliament that she would not declare the 39 Indians dead without concrete proof or evidence.""It is a sin to declare a person dead without concrete evidence. I will not do this sin,"" Swaraj said in a statement in the Lok Sabha in 2017.Now, with the deaths confirmed, Swaraj said the Indians' mortal remains will be brought back to India by Union minister of state for external affairs, VK Singh.""General VK Singh will go to Iraq to bring back mortal remains of Indians killed in Iraq. The plane carrying mortal remains will first go to Amritsar, then to Patna and then to Kolkata,"" the minister added.Most of the 39 killed were from Punjab and were working on projects near Mosul when they were kidnapped during their evacuation.Swaraj today also informed the House that the story of Harjit Masih, who managed to escape from ISIS, was a lie.

AGRA: Four days after a murder convict was shot dead by police during an encounter to rescue 25 children, a man who tried to mediate during the 9-hour long stand-off claimed on Tuesday that the abductor wanted punishment for two policemen who “tortured him” in custody in a theft case and asked “sexual favour” from his wife in lieu of his release.When contacted, senior district police officials rejected the charges, but assured a probe into the allegation and into the role of the two policemen.The accused, Subhash Batham , was shot dead early on Friday while his wife died hours later on the way to hospital after being brutally attacked by locals in Farrukhabad ’s Kathariya village. Batham organised a birthday party for his daughter and then held 25 children who were his “guests” hostage on Thursday.On Tuesday, when TOI contacted Anupam Dubey alias Balloo , who was shot at and injured by Batham while trying to negotiate peace, said, “During my one-hour interaction with Batham, he accused two police constables of Farrukhabad of torturing him in custody. He also alleged that the policemen also asked sexual favours from his wife in lieu of his release in a theft case.”A contractual driver of UP roadways, Dubey was approached by Bhojpur MLA Nagendra Singh to talk to Batham during the stand-off.“Everyone present there heard Batham, but no one did anything. The entire drama was set up to attract administration’s attention in order to punish those two policemen,” said Dubey.When asked why he was shot by Batham, Anupam said, “I don’t think he wanted to shoot me.”Additional superintendent of police, Farrukhabad, Tribhuwan Singh said, “Batham planned this entire hostage situation for many months to extort money. He demanded Rs 1 crore for each child taken hostage. He constructed basement in his house several months ago and also gathered heavy explosive material to target policemen.”“We will look into the harassment allegation and question the policemen whose names have come up,” he added.In Video: Farrukhabad abduction drama: Kidnapper accused 2 cops of seeking sexual favours from his wife, says mediator"

GURUGRAM: A cash collection van of a Delhi-based private company was robbed of Rs 17 lakh by three armed assailants, after taking the driver hostage at gunpoint in Sector 29 market on Monday.According to the police, the cash van belongs to Radiant Cash Management Services that has its office in Jhandewalan in New Delhi. The company works as a cash collecting agent that helps establishments get their money deposited to the bank count by paying a fee to the company.On Monday, the cashier of the company along with Dinesh Bharti — the driver — were on the duty of collecting money from different clients. “After collecting cash from Dwarka and Najafgarh, we had reached the Sector 29 market in Gurugram to collect cash from Croma Centre. The cashier had gone inside and I was waiting in the van that was parked on the roadside. Suddenly three men arrived in a car and held me hostage at gunpoint. They snatched the cash bag from the van and fled,” Dinesh told police.A PCR call was made and a team from Sector 29 police station immediately reached the spot and started scanning the CCTV footage of the area to identify the accused.“Maybe the accused were following the van from some distance and attacked the driver after the cashier went inside the market. Role of an insider cannot be ruled out as the entire episode appears to be a well-planned one. We are recording the statement of the two to understand the sequence of events,” said a senior officer adding that there was no security guard in the van and cash bag too was not kept inside any enclosed area.Police spokesperson Subhash Boken said on the basis of the complaint a case has been registered at Sector 29 police station."

KATHARIYA VILLAGE( FARRUKHABAD): When 25 children in UP’s Farrukhabad district entered Subhash Batham ’s house on Thursday evening, apart from the missing confetti there was little indication that this wasn’t, in fact, a birthday party. They were welcomed by Batham’s wife into a 10 x 8 basement where several packets of snacks, biscuits, chocolates and milk were kept. The cold, mud floor was covered in mats for the kids to sit on. In the ensuing 10 hours in which the crisis unfolded, Batham and his wife reportedly took turns to check up on the kids, with the latter even serving them roti and sabzi.For these children in Kathariya village, most of whom were aged between one and 15, a birthday invite was as rare as it was alluring. Many hail from poor households, with their parents struggling to make ends meet. So when word spread around on Thursday afternoon that a party was to be held, they were eager to join the celebrations. Their parents too felt there was little reason to worry.Batham had a chequered past — he had spent 12 years in prison for killing his uncle — but he hadn’t displayed aggressive behaviour towards anyone in the village and as one villager said, ""It had been years since that incident in 2001."" But within hours, as news came that Batham was armed and making demands to release the children, parents started assembling in front of the house, fearing the worst. Inside, the children were anxious but well-fed.A day later, many of the children TOI spoke to said they were still shocked with the turn of events but happy to be back home. The younger ones, however, showed little understanding that they had been at the centre of a raging drama that had everyone on tenterhooks. But most seemed to agree on one thing — their kidnapper was not out to harm them. ""I don’t believe he (Batham) wanted to harm us. He warned us to keep quiet and said there would be consequences if we didn’t, but he didn’t hurt anyone,"" said Anjali Kumari , the eldest among those who had been held hostage. Batham had a pistol and a rifle with him, said the children, but he never pointed it at them.On Friday, when TOI visited the spot, candy wrappers were strewn across the basement. Instead of a staircase, a ladder paved the way to the dingy space bereft of windows, with an LED bulb the only source of light. A metal door separated the basement from the rest of the house. It was this door that Anjali bolted shut after the children had been stuck in the room for hours and their patience started wearing thin. This cut off Batham’s access to the children and minimised their chances of getting caught in a crossfire. ""After I locked the door, Subash uncle and his wife banged on the door several times, but I didn’t open it. Two hours later, we were rescued by police,” said Anjali.While initially scared, the children said they felt better once food was served. Arun Kumar , 10, said that the couple served everyone food and water. “We were given biscuit, chocolate, milk, water and some ate roti and sabzi. But when we wanted to pee, we were told to go in a corner and relieve ourselves,” added Soni Kumari, 12, who was confined along with two of her siblings. As there wasn’t much to do, some of the children went to sleep.When an infant wouldn’t stop crying, Batham decided to go outside to release her. That’s when Anjali shut the door from inside. The children didn’t have to wait long though. A couple of hours, later, police made their way to the building and shot Batham dead.Residents of the quiet village said they were still coming to terms with the incident that had shoved them into the limelight. But things could have turned out differently, said Babli Devi, whose house is next to Batham’s. ""Three of my children were in there too. And I will always remember this traumatic night but would I have wanted them dead for it? I don’t think so. Perhaps, police could have caught Batham, instead of killing him.""A police officer said, ""We negotiated with Batham for hours and went into the building to arrest him, but he brandished a gun. So we had to shoot.""The couple have been booked under sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement). Batham has also been booked under the Arms Act."

MYSURU: The incident of a 15-year-old schoolgirl being held hostage and raped by five different men for over five months in the city has sent shockwaves across the district.The girl was forcefully taken away by a moneylender on January 7 as the girl’s mother failed to repay a loan . Five people, including the moneylender Padhma, have been booked under various sections of IPC and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (Pocso).A police constable, who is friend of Padhma, too, was allegedly involved in the crime. But he has not been named in the FIR. An IPC section (whoever being a police officer commits rape ), however, has been included in the FIR and a probe is under way.Police commissioner K T Balakrishna told TOI that two people have been arrested and search is on for other accused.“The incident has left the family in a state of shock with the survivor ’s father attempting suicide after learning about the experience his daughter had to undergo at the hands of the moneylender and her friends. The family is feeling threatened,” a child activist claimed.On the other side, the incident has also exposed the practice of lending money at high rates of interest that is going on unabated. Sources claimed that the girl’s mother had taken Rs 3 lakh from Padhma, her friend, to fend for her treatment on weekly interest. As the family failed to pay the money back, Padhma forcefully took away her daughter, a class IX student.The girl was rescued with the help of Odanadi Seva Samsthe on June 6 and an FIR was filed on June 10.The other accused in the case are Prasanna, Vinodh, a lecturer, Ravi and Vicky.Odanadi Seva Samsthe director L Parashuram told TOI that the girl’s mother had approached them and subsequently they met senior police officers seeking help. “We were kept away from the rescue operation by Kuvempunagar police who rescued the girl and sent her with parents. A day later the girl’s family again approached us following which we took them to the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), a quasi-judicial body, which took cognizance of the case and handed over the girl’s custody to us,” he said.The same day police took the survivor from Odanadi for a medical test and then to the judge for recording statements. After the procedures were completed, police didn’t bring back the girl to Odanadi. Officials claimed that the girl expressed her wish of going with her parents before the judge and she was again sent with her mother.Parashuram said the jurisdictional police did not follow procedures and threw the laws governing children and rape survivors to wind. “We have explained the development to CWC and are awaiting their directive,” he added.CWC chairperson Kamala H T said, “We have sent the girl to Odanadi, but the childcare and protection institution has written to us about the developments. The case will be taken up for hearing on Friday.”"

BIJNOR: Residents of Bijnor ’s Naiwala village held forest officials hostage on Sunday, demanding security for themselves and their livestock after a leopard killed and partially devoured a colt there. For some time, a stray leopard has been prowling around in the area, posing a threat to several villages but forest department authorities has made no efforts to catch it, they claimed. The villagers said they could not go on living in constant fear while forest department did nothing to protect them.According to villagers, on the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday, a leopard entered human inhabited area and killed a colt tied up for the night in a shed on the fringes of Naiwala village under Heempur police station area.On Sunday, its owner discovered the carcass and informed police. According to the Liyaqat Ali , “I have some horses, including a colt. They were tied in the yard on the outskirts of the village. I found its partially devoured carcass on Sunday. Earlier. I had spotted a leopard in the area.”As news spread, angry villagers gathered at the spot. They staged a protest against forest department and alleged that they had informed the forest authorities about the presence of a leopard in the area but they did nothing to catch it.After being informed about the colt’s killing, a forest team reached the spot. But enraged villagers took them hostage and held them captive for hours. They demanded that the leopard be caught and released into the forest area. In summer, most villagers sleep in the open and with a leopard prowling about, the situation can prove to be dangerous, especially as these leopards are known to lift children.The forest authorities were set free only after they assured the villagers that they would set up a cage in the area to catch the leopard.Confirming that the colt was killed by the leopard, Bijnor divisional forest officer M Semmaran said, “The colt’s post-mortem revealed that it was eaten by a leopard. There is a provision that if we set up a cage, we have to take permission from the higher authorities. The procedure is underway and cage will be set up soon. We have convinced villagers that it will not attack the human being. But they should take precautions. When a leopard does not get its natural prey, it moves towards populated area in search of small prey like dogs, goats, calves, colts, sheep and poultry.”"

BHOPAL: An eerie silence grips you in the fifth-floor flat that was the scene of so much agony and turmoil only a week ago when a crazed stalker took a model hostage at gunpoint, stabbed her in the neck and let her bleed for 12 hours as he played games with police.The survivor still carries stitches and bruises from her ordeal, but is determined not to give in. Giving details of the ‘longest day’ for the first time, she told TOI on Saturday that the hostage-taker, Rohit Singh, kept beating her brutally all through the 12-hour crisis and would hiss in her ears that she wouldn’t get out of the room alive. Showing a bite mark on her arm, she said: “After resisting a few times, I realized it was better to play submissive. I was bleeding from the neck wound and feared I would bleed to death.”“But I am alive. I am strong and I will not let this kill my dreams. He only wanted cheap popularity. He was insisting that he would open the door only if a Bollywood celebrity comes,” she added.Her parents, however, are still shaken. The room where the hostage crisis played out has not been cleaned. Every knock on the door sends shivers down their spines. The parents, who had never seen a police station or courtroom before this, are living in terror. “We saw such things only in movies. Now, I feel terrified simply walking through the parking lot. Every now and then, it feels as if Rohit is hiding behind a car and will pounce on me,” said her mother.Rohit is now in jail custody and her parents have sought police protection, fearing that he will come after them once he is released. Recalling his arrest in February this year for threatening the family, the survivor’s mother said: “That time, someone calling herself his sister pleaded with us to spare him. Look, he came back with more dangerous intentions.”They fear every stranger, say the parents. “Yesterday, I went to court to record my statement. When I was waiting outside the court, a man kept glaring at me. I felt terrified as I feared he is an accomplice of Rohit,” she said, adding that the incident has shattered the family. “I was trying to find a match for my son, who works in Mumbai but now have forgotten about that. My younger daughter was planning to take admission in MBA but she has almost cancelled the plan,” she said.The survivor’s father said, “It has changed our lives. Many of our friends and relatives look at us differently now. We will have to try harder for the marriage of our children. My hands shake when I write something. What is the guarantee that Rohit will not come after us again? He should be jailed for life.”What hurts the survivor more than the bruises on her body is the reaction of people around her. “People think that I became a victim because I was into modelling in Mumbai,” she said. Police, court and media are doing their job, but what about the security of my family, she asked. “Will anyone tell us how he entered my flat? How can we stop him from breaking in again?” she said."

BHOPAL: Hostage taker Rohit Singh , who allegedly stabbed a model and held her confined in her bedroom for 12 hours in Bhopal on Friday, got a taste of public ‘justice’.Cops paraded Rohit in public in Misrod on Saturday, and egged on people to whack him. Archana Sapre, a resident of the township where the rescued hostage lives, told TOI that police had informed them about the parade in advance. It was SP-south R K Lodha, who ordered that Rohit be paraded in public “to send a message”.Residents, mostly women, lined up on the road with sticks, sandals and black paint. Rohit was brought in and the crowd was allowed to have a go at him.The hostage taker, who claims to work as an assistant casting director in Bollywood, was unfazed. Showing just how dangerous he can be, he grabbed sub-inspector Rajni Chouhan’s hand — despite being hemmed in by cops — squeezed it hard and wouldn’t let go. It took two cops to prise his fingers off her.Meanwhile, residents beat him with sandals, shoes and sticks. They were upset that they were not allowed to blacken his face. Sapre rues that the jostling of reporters and camerapersons did not give them enough room to assault him.While this mob justice was playing out, the hostage lay in ICU, an oxygen mask covering her face. She is lucky to be alive because the scissors stab wound in her neck was 2 inches deep. The carotid artery is only about 2cm under the skin, which means the blades missed it by millimetres.She bled for 12 hours from this wound and another stab to the thigh — again missing the femoral artery and major blood vessels — as police dragged on the negotiations.She has been given three blood transfusions and still has an alarmingly low haemoglobin count of 6 gm/dl because of excessive blood loss, say sources in the medical staff treating her.“Rohit had taken us hostage in our own home a few months ago. He was emboldened to repeat the offence because he wasn’t dealt with strictly then. We do not feel safe and don’t know if he will leave us alone now. He might attack us again. I feel he should rot in jail for life,” said the model’s mother.ASP (Zone-II) Dinesh Kaushal, told TOI that she described him as a “psycho”. According to her, he broke into the house when her father had gone out for his morning walk, said Kaushal. “At gunpoint, he kept pressuring her to marry him and sign the stamp paper provided by police. When she resisted, he stabbed her with scissors. She decided to play submissive because she knew that he would shoot her if she fought him,” the ASP said."

She told reporters that she wanted him to be given the death penalty. ""Rohit should be hanged,"" she told reporters.""Initially, he did not bother me. He started troubling me in Mumbai - asking me to marry him - since November. Yesterday, he forced me to sign a stamp paper stating that I will marry him. I don't want to marry him. Send him to jail or he will kill me,"" she said.Inspector Chouse said Singh had inflicted injuries on the neck of the woman with scissors.Singh has told police that he would have shot her dead had she not promised to marry him and then would have committed suicide, Chouse said.""A firearm with one bullet and the pair of scissors have been recovered from him,"" Ghouse said.The hostage crisis ended at around 7pm lst evening after police managed to convince Singh to release the woman on the promise that he would not be harmed, according to police.Chouse said police, perched on a hydraulic ladder, succeeded in convincing him after a face-to-face talk through a window.Singh had entered the woman's home during the morning hours when her father had stepped outside to buy milk. Later, he took her inside a room and bolted it from inside, police said.He then recorded a video and sent it to a TV journalist, saying the woman's family were opposed to their marriage.

PANAJI: The Congress on Saturday accused the management of a on-shore casino in North Goa of holding three employees hostage for five days following a discrepancy of Rs 1.8 crore in the casino’s accounts.“The three employees were taken hostage, beaten up and deprived of food for five days,” Congress MLA Nilkanth Halarnkar told reporters on Saturday.“We want an enquiry by the home ministry into this inhuman act,” Halarnkar said. “How can anyone lock employees in a room for five days, beat them up and deprive them of food, holding them hostage?” Halarnkar added that he decided to help one of the victims, Chandan Pant, a Nepali national whose case was brought to his notice by a city lawyer.The three were kept hostage from December 16 to 20 in the casino, before they were rescued by the police.Coerced by cops not to lodge complaint: Casino employeePant, who was also present for the press conference, explained how they were kept hostage for five days, even as he was on leave — he had gone home to Nepal — when the discrepancy in accounts happened. Pant also said his documents were not released by the casino management, making it difficult for him to find work elsewhere.“Our question is why was no FIR filed against the casino that took these boys hostage?” Halarnkar asked. “This is despite the fact that a police team had to rescue the three persons from the custody of the casino.”Pant, in his complaint to the DGP, said that after being rescued by the police team, he had been coerced by the police not to file a complaint against the casino management."

NEW DELHI: IL&FS Transportation Network Limited ( ITNL ), a part of the beleaguered IL&FS Group, on Monday said four of its employees who were held hostage for three months by workers in Ethiopia have returned home.The firm managed to “secure” their safe return after paying severance pay of four months to workers who were involved with road projects being executed by ITNL, through its subsidiary Elsamex SA. But at least one employee, Chandra Sekhar, is still in Ethiopia as the authorities have barred him from leaving the country till IL&FS clears statutory dues.The employee is currently out on bail with no certainty on when the group will clear the dues, enabling his return to India. Since mid-2018, under instructions of ITNL, several Indian employees working in its project companies had returned to India.

FAIZABAD: Violence erupted at Faizabad divisional jail, following clashes between two groups of inmates on Saturday. Crisis deepened when jail guards were held hostage by inmates, who laid siege to the prison compound and demanded action against those who triggered violence.Agitated jail inmates threatened to blow up LPG cylinders inside the mess, forcing police and PAC jawans to exercise caution while trying to restore order. Senior officials were forced to use drone cameras to take stock of the situation. The situation was brought under control after senior administrative officials reached the site to supervise police action and convinced inmates to call off their protest.Sparks flew when some inmates recently shifted from Azamgarh Prison were spotted using a mobile phone by prison guard, Bhola, who informed the jail superintendent. Enraged over this, the new inmates thrashed Bhola. When other prisoners rushed to his rescue, they too were attacked. The situation worsened when other inmates created ruckus, demanding action against those who attacked the guard and held them hostage.The jail administration’s attempt to bring additional reinforcements failed as inmates took over the jail mess and threatened to blow up the kitchen to keep security forces at bay. CCTV cameras were also damaged. Authorities used drone cameras to identify strategic entry points inside the campus and then used force to counter the rampaging prisoners.It took authorities almost 6 hours to gain access into the prison and rescue inmates held hostage and rush them to the district hospital for treatment as they were injured. Faizabad district magistrate Anil Kumar Pathak said, a magisterial inquiry has been ordered into the incident and action will be initiated against those responsible for violence, once the probe report is received."

Pune: Four armed intruders on Wednesday morning held Mumbai-based cotton trader Hanskumar Khimji (79), his sister-in-law Hema Chheda (63) and domestic helps hostage at gunpoint for over three hours in his bungalow in an isolated bylane off Apte Road in the Deccan Gymkhana area. They robbed cash and valuables worth Rs 5.70 lakh.The intruders moved into the ground-plus-one bungalow around 9.30am. When Khimji told them that he did not have much cash and valuables in the bungalow, one of the intruders left with the trader’s driver to his Mumbai office in Chheda’s car to collect Rs 1 crore.For over three hours, the remaining three criminals moved around in Khimji’s bungalow after tying up the caretaker and domestic help. They pushed Khimji and Chheda into one of the rooms on the upper floor of the bungalow.At one point around 1.30pm, all three criminals had moved out of the upper room. Chheda displayed alacrity to immediately bolt the door from the inside and raise an alarm. Panicked at her cries, the criminals ran out of the bungalow towards hotel Ramee Grand and from there fled towards Jangli Maharaj road.The fourth culprit, who had by then reached Kurla in Mumbai in the car with Khimji’s driver, received an alert from his aides. He got down from the car and fled.Chheda later lodged a complaint with the Deccan Gymkhana police, who registered an offence under sections 392 (robbery), 384 (extortion), 386 (extortion by putting a person in fear of death or grievous hurt) and 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Indian Arms Act.When TOI visited the bungalow, Chheda’s son, who did not reveal his first name, said, “The criminals ran away from the bungalow thanks to the presence of mind shown by my mother. They have robbed some valuables. No one was hurt.”Khimji occasionally visits the bungalow, “Saroj Sadan”. “It is an old structure and the owner wanted to sell it off,” senior inspector Bhaskar Jadhav of the Deccan Gymkhana police said.“Khimji, Chheda, driver Shivaji Medage (50), caretaker Anant Khale (45) and a domestic help were in the bungalow on Wednesday morning when the doorbell rang. When Khale opened the door, the four men barged inside, pushed him down and tied his hands. Brandishing a firearm and sharp weapons, they threatened Khimji and the others of dire consequences. They tied up Medage and the maid with tape and locked them with Khale in one of the rooms. They pushed Khimji and Chheda into another room and asked them to hand over their valuables,” Jadhav said.When Khimji told them that he did not have much cash and valuables in the bungalow, one of the criminals left with the driver to the trader’s Mumbai office to collect Rs 1 crore. The criminals told Khimji and Chheda that three of them would remain in the bungalow till the driver returned with the money.Two criminals searched Khimji’s cupboards and took gold and diamond ornaments worth Rs 5.70 lakh. Their third accomplice sat in the room where Khimji and Chheda were kept hostage. “They were constantly in touch with their fourth accomplice travelling to Mumbai. They moved around the bungalow smoking,” Jadhav said.“While the criminals were inside, some interested buyers had come to Khimji’s bungalow. When they rang the bell, the trio did not respond initially. As the bell was constantly ringing, one of them went down and had a talk with one of them at the door,” Jadhav said.When the criminal in Khimji’s room went out to talk with the others around 1.30pm, Chheda locked the door from inside, ran towards the window and started calling out to the neighbours in the adjacent bungalow and residents of a building nearby. The criminals panicked and fled with a bag containing the booty.Jadhav said the car driver and the fourth criminal had reached Kurla by then. “The driver later told us that the criminal told him to stop the car around 1.30pm and fled,” he said."

SHAHJAHANPUR: In another embarrassment to UP Police, two head constables were arrested on Tuesday for allegedly stopping a businessman on the road on the pretext of checking his car and holding him and his driver hostage in the vehicle for hours for ransom. The duo had received information that the businessman was carrying Rs 50 lakh in his car and were lying in wait for him on Tilhar road in Shahjahanpur. The businessman managed to contact his partner, who informed police and the hostages were rescued.Both accused policemen were immediately suspended, arrested and booked for extortion and fraud. Both were sent to jail after they were presented before the chief judicial magistrate on Tuesday.Prem Prakash, additional director general of police, Bareilly zone, told TOI, “They (head constables) have been booked under relevant IPC sections. SP, Shahjahanpur has orally informed me about the incident and I am waiting for a written report in this matter. Stern action will be taken.”According to sources, Gyanendra Pandey, a businessman based in Uttarakhand’s Kashipur town was on way to Hardoi district in his car along with driver, Prashant Kumar, on Monday, when the two head constables flagged the vehicle to stop in Tilhar area of Shahjahanpur district . Pandey was carrying Rs 50 lakh with him for purchasing paddy from a local dealer in Hardoi.What Pandey did not know was that the two policemen — head constable Mahendra Singh, who was posted at Tilhar police station, and Satyadev, a former member of the crime branch team who was recently transferred to reserve lines after a complaint -- had prior information that he was carrying Rs 50 lakh and were lying in wait for him.Satyadev allegedly introduced himself as sub-inspector Abhishek Kumar from the income-tax department to Pandey, “inspected” his car and “seized” the cash. Thereafter, one of the policemen took charge of the car and told Pandey that the cash would be submitted at the income-tax office where he would have to reveal the source of the money. But instead of taking the businessman and driver to the I-T office, the duo drove towards Jalalabad. Later, they demanded more money.Meanwhile, Pandey sensed that both men were trying to dupe him and so he requested them to allow him to make a phone call to his partner. Pandey somehow managed to convey his situation to his partner and asked him to contact police for help.This matter was brought to the attention of inspector general of police, Bareilly range and all the police stations in Shahjahanpur were alerted. A massive manhunt was launched.

BENGALURU: The case of JD(S) legislator K Narayana Gowda allegedly being “held hostage” in Mumbai and being prevented from meeting anyone, including his family members, figured in the legislative assembly on Tuesday.Raising the issue during the debate on the audio clip, JD(S) legislator KM Shivalingegowda said after learning that Gowda was ill, his family members had gone to Mumbai to meet him. But, he claimed, the people holding the MLA captive did not allow them to meet him“This is where we have reached,” Shivalingegowda said. “MLAs are being held captive and purchased in an attempt to grab power.”Without naming the BJP , he took the saffron party to task for trying to bribe ruling coalition MLAs to get them to resign in a bid to topple the government. “There is an urgent need for a law that prevents MLAs from resigning their assembly membership before the end of their tenure. Only this can stop MLAs being lured through inducements,” Shivalingegowda said.CN Balakrishna, also of the JD(S), expressed concern over Gowda’s safety. “He represents a constituency that borders mine and I know him very well. He has been held hostage in Maharashtra,” Balakrishna claimed.BJP members took serious exception to JD(S) legislators raising the issue instead of taking action against those who have kept their MLA captive. “You are part of the government and you are free to conduct an inquiry if your MLA is really being held hostage by anyone,” BJP MLA Basavaraj Bommai said. “It is not right on your part to play the victim card.”"

The two men went to a nearby village and called for help. They arranged a JCB and got the cars removed,” he claimed.Later, they drove to Ropar, where the accused again withdrew Rs 15,000 from an ATM and started driving towards Nawanshahr. A little while later, they withdrew Rs 20,000 from another ATM booth, Inderjit alleged. At around 5.30 am, they stopped at a dhaba for food and reached Kapurthala by 7am, Inderjit alleged. “They booked a room at a hotel and after resting for some time, they went to JBT Mall and did shopping of Rs 15,000 by using my credit card of the victim,” Inderjit alleged.On Sunday afternoon, the accused dropped Inderjit near Banga town after giving him Rs 400 for travelling back home. Inderjit said the kidnappers also took away his mobile phone. He borrowed a phone from a stranger and called up his brother Jatinder Singh.Jatinder told police that he had received an email from the bank mentioning about the shopping at the mall in Kapurthala.Police registered a case of kidnapping and extortion at Kharar police station."

BARASAT: A four-year-old girl, along with her 27-year-old mother, was forced to walk back her Barasat home after bandh supporters attacked the school van that the mother-daughter duo had boarded to reach school. They thought it won’t be right to travel by train either and decided to return home on foot.Four-year-old Sumaiya Khatun and her mother Amina Begum spent more than 20 minutes fearing for their lives while remaining cooped up in a corner of the school van while bandh supporters damaged its looking glass, severely beat up the driver and tried to deflate its tyres at Barasat’s Champadali crossing around 7am. Sumaiya, a kindergarten student at Delhi Public Secondary School, and her mother, a non-teaching staffer of the same institution, board the van from this location every day to reach the campus at Barasat’s Moina. But Tuesday’s violence in front of their eyes forced a traumatised Sumaiya to return home with her mother on foot.Witnesses said van driver Nayeem Ali (34), who took up this job two years ago, pleaded with the bandh supporters to let him go. But, Ali was dragged out and beaten up by bandh enforcers who relented only after the driver promised he would abandon his trip and not pick up any more students. After Sumaiya and her mother got off, Ali drove the empty bus to school before returning to his home at Barasat’s Sunripukur locality. At home, his six-year-old son Syed Ali and 11-year-old daughter Sumaiya Parveen were fearing the worst after seeing television footage of their father being beaten up. The duo later also abandoned their plans of going to their respective schools.The West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights (WBCPCR) has taken cognizance of the matter. A show-cause notice is being sent to Sujan Chakrabarty and other office bearers of CPM, a source said.Jayanta Mondal, the chief security guard of the school, however, said, “I attended my duty at the school and heard about the attack on our van.” Abhijit Banerjee , ASP, North 24 Parganas, said, “A case has been registered and we have already arrested 10 bandh supporters involved in the attack.”"

Iranian national Parvin Ghelichi arrived in Pune from Tehran in May. Her boyfriend Dhanraj Morarji (circled) told the police she was his wife, even as a visibly battered Ghelichi looked on

The Pune Police free student who was confined, beaten up by her boyfriend, the son of lateDhanraj Morarji, the son of textile tycoon Arvind Morarji and half-brother of actorturned politician Naghma, was arrested early Monday for assaulting his live-in partner, who is an Iranian national.The complainant, Parvin Ghelichi, told the police that Morarji kept her confined in his apartment in Koregaon Park, Pune, for over a month, and would beat her up on the flimsiest of pretexts. The Pune Police rescued 30-year-old Ghelichi from the flat in an operation lasting many hours of the night intervening between Sunday and Monday.Morarji has been booked under the Indian Penal Code sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 342 (wrongful confinement), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means), 370 (buying or disposing of any person as a slave), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 506 (criminal intimidation).The police have managed to retrieve Ghelichi’s passport, mobile phone, and other documents. Throughout the police operation, Morarji kept insisting that Naghma was his sister.Ghelichi told the police that she had come to Pune to pursue a course in computer software. She managed to alert a friend about her ordeal with a desperate message on Instagram. Her friend in turn got in touch with Mirror, whose reporter witnessed her rescue by the Koregaon Park police at the upscaleAs she ran out of the house and into the arms of her friend, amid Morarji’s violent protestations, the bruised and battered student broke down, narrating the story of the entire nightmare.Ghelichi, who is from Tehran, arrived in Pune in May this year to pursue a two-year diploma in computer tech. During recording a statement with the police, she said that she met Morarji through a common friend in the first week of November. After a few meetings, a romance began budding, and soon, Ghelichi moved into Morarji’s apartment.“He was really nice to me initially. He kept on showering me with affection and I really loved him for making me feel special,” Ghelichi told the police. Rapidly thereafter, things went downhill between the couple.She said that Morarji began to beat her up often over the pettiest issues. “He once fought with a friend and got very riled up. Before I knew what he was doing, he started punching and kicking me. I just couldn’t wrap my head around what was happening.”“He would assault me for no rhyme or reason at least a couple of times a week. Each time he beat me up, the next morning, he would wake up and express regret for his actions. Even though I wanted to escape, I couldn’t — all my documents and passport were locked away with him. Every night, he kept dogs he had made ferocious right outside the bedroom, to ensure I did not step out without him,” Ghelichi revealed. There were just a few moments that Morarji gave Ghelichi her phone back in the last few weeks, but he always went through all her texts. “Even when I would message my mother, I had to show him the phone first” she claimed. This torment lasted for well over a month. Finally, by December 22, Ghelichi couldn’t take it anymore. “He took me out for dinner with one of his cronies against my will. Iwent to use the washroom. As soon as I came out, he slapped me hard and I started bleeding. Once we got home, he thrashed me all over again,” she wept. Luckily for her, Morarji stepped out of the house that very night — seizing the opportunity, she gathered enough courage to grab her phone and send out a desperate message for help to a friend, who is also from Tehran. “I used Instagram to send this message — Iknew he would go through my phone and multiple apps once more. But he was not very good with Instagram,” she told cops. Her friend got in touch with the Mirror team. Within hours, a rescue was planned by a team of Koregaon Park cops, who reached the society around 12.15 am. Morarji’s flat is on the third floor, and his entrance covered by closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras. When he opened the door, police told him that they had received a complaint about a woman being kept forcefully in the house. While he was not even ready to let the police see Ghelichi, after an argument of 15 minutes or so, two female constables managed to get her out. Throughout, Morarji continued shouting at the cops, claiming Ghelichi is his wife.After an hour or so of arguments, cops finally took the woman away to the police station. Police inspector (crime) Ganesh Mane of Koregaon Park Police Station said, “Morarji was arrested and produced in court, which remanded him in police custody for two days. Investigations are on.”"

KOZHIKODE: Maoists have denied that they have taken hostage migrants workers at the construction site of a resort in Meppadi in Wayanad and claimed that they only warned against the construction of the resort inside the forest.Sources in the CPI (Maoist) said they had warned against the construction of the resort earlier too. They said the work on Emerald resort was stopped and all workers had returned after they issued the warning. The Maoists allege that it could be the police who sent the migrant labourers or they could be police agents.Three migrant workers were stopped and questioned by an armed Maoist group at around 6pm on Thursday. Police said the workers came across four Maoists who were carrying arms. The workers tried to take photographs of the Maoists using a mobile phone.One worker fled the scene and informed the police. Others were let off by the Maoists one by one.After they returned, police took them to the camp to get the details of the Maoists. A police team and the members of the Thunderbolts have begun search operation for the Maoists in the forest.Police believe the Maoists who stopped the workers were Vikram Gowda, Soman, Santhosh and Unnimaya. They said the Maoists have intensified their activities in Wayanad and Kozhikode districts in the recent months.They suspect that B G Krishnamoothy, the Maoist leader from Karnataka , has been leading the rebels after the killing of Kuppu Devaraj in a police firing in Nilambur in 2015.The Maoists had attacked a resort in Thirunelli in 2014 to mark the 10th anniversary of the formation of the PLGA. They had also threatened to take strong action against the resort mafia."

Decamp with 18 watches, a– booty worth Rs 4.5 lakhAs if muggings on the road were not scary enough, a man living in an apartment complex in HBR Layout was robbed right inside his flat, which has a security system and CCTVs in place, on Monday.A group of three goons got past the security of the apartment carrying lethal weapons and threatened a private firm manager at knife point, robbed him of his gold chains, wrist watches, a camera and perfume bottles, all together, a booty worth Rs 4.5 lakh.According to the complaint filed by John (name changed on request), a resident of Sai Suma apartment in HBR Layout, he was alone at home when there was a knock on the door. He opened the door and a man asked him for drinking water. As John went to the kitchen to get water, three men managed to enter the house. One of the men flashed a knife at John. “Another man took a knife kept on my dining table and kept it on my throat. I asked them to take what they want and not harm me. They took two gold chains that I was wearing. Two of the men went up to a cupboard in the guest room and took 18 wrist watches, perfume bottles, and a brand new DSLR camera,” he told Bangalore Mirror.There was another knock on the door. This time, John was sure his wife was coming home from work. “I requested the miscreants to let her be. One of the men followed me holding the knife to my back, while I opened the door just a bit and asked my wife to go to the terrace as I was talking to my friends about our property. She went up to the terrace,” he said.They then asked for a ring he was wearing, but John told them they would have to kill him to take the ring as it was a gift from his mother.The miscreants wanted his mobile and laptop, but John told them it belongs to his office and that they couldn’t use it or sell it as all devices would be blocked. “They took Rs 1,500 from my wallet and left the house.”After this, he called his wife and sister and alerted the police about the robbery. The private firm employee asked the security guard how he could have allowed people without questioning their whereabouts.Hennur police have checked footage from the CCTV camera installed on the ground floor. The footage shows the three men walking inside, signing on the ledger with the guard. The guard is seen busy playing with a child. The camera installed at an adjacent commercial complex, shows the trio came on a bike, which they parked there.Police also found that the miscreants had visited the apartment on May 25 and June 18 and all the times they had given the name as Ziad.On Monday they went there by 5.20 pm, but entered the timing as 6.35 pm and exit time as 6.40 pm, but the guard did not check. “We have formed a team to nab the miscreants,” an officer said.

Chandrapur: Naxalites set 16 vehicles on fire engaged in road construction work in Etapalli tehsil of Gadchiroli district on Friday night. The workers deployed for the work too were held hostage for the entire night, sources said. The incident came to light on Saturday morning.Maoists in Dandakaranya area observe People Liberation Guerrilla Army ( PLGA) week every year between December 2 and 8 and execute many violent attacks during the period.This year, the rebels took the security forces gearing up to counter PLGA week by surprise by carrying out massive arson a day before.Sources said the road construction work was underway on Wattepalli Gattepali road at a site close to Halewra village in Etapalli tehsil. A large group of Naxalites came to the site during late night hours and rounded up all the labourers camping there.They then took out diesel from the vehicles and set 10 JCB machines, 5 tractors and a pick-up van at the site on fire. Sources said that Naxalites stayed on the spot as the vehicles burned to ashes. The workers remained hostage at gunpoint till Maoists left.Security forces rushed to the spot after the incident was reported in the morning. Combing operations have been launched in the area in search of the Naxalites.In December 2016, Maoists had set on fire around 80 vehicles near Surjagarh hillock in one of the largest arsons in the history of the Maoists affected district.Speculations are rife that the tactics could be the outcome of change in leadership after Nambala Keshav Rao alias Basavraju took over the reins of the banned CPI (Maoist) in the country.Basavraj is learnt to be an aggressive leader and has been responsible for major attacks on security forces in rebel-dominated areas.Maoists in Gadchiroli were on the backfoot after security forces killed around 40 Naxalites in Gadchiroli in April this year. Friday’s arson could be an attempt to bounce back under the new leadership, sources said."

""Here (the) situation is very tense. May not be able to contact after one or two days... Local security hired by company are armed. They are with locals only."" It's an anguished cry for help from Neeraj Raghuvanshi, one of the seven employees of IL&FS Transportation Network Ltd held hostage by unpaid workers in Ethiopia Raghuvanshi, who TOI managed to contact, has been surviving on a diet of rice and potato for the last six days, with little help from his company. His colleagues, C Chandra Sekhar and KP Singh, who have managed to stay free in Addis Ababa, said the situation was very grim and they feared water supply would be snapped in the next few days. The seven employees are under ""house arrest"" and are not being allowed to venture out of their rooms, said one of their colleagues.Raghuvanshi, Sekhar and Singh are part of a group of 15 employees of a joint venture between IL&FS Transportation Networks and Spanish company Elsamex that is engaged in road construction.They are now facing the consequences of the mismanagement of former IL&FS chief Ravi Parthsarathy and his ousted team of executives. The Indian expats themselves have not been paid salaries for months, with some of the dues dating back to April.With funds drying up, the Ethiopian Roads Authority has terminated the contracts and there is a fear that the joint venture may leave behind unpaid dues.IL&FS Transportation Network was unable to pay salary to its 500-600 local staff in October and the dues for November, too, have piled up. The demand is for an immediate payment of around $300,000. ""But the problem will not stop there. Under local laws, the company has to offer severance packages for six months and there are unpaid dues of vendors,"" Chandra Sekhar, the country coordinator for ITNL Elsamex JV told TOI.What has compounded the problem is that even Ethiopian authorities are worried that the company may not clear its dues, creating distress in the African country as the local employees are very poor and depend solely on their salaries for survival.While the problem has been building up, the IL&FS management has refused to provide any help, alleged some of the employees taken hostage. IL&FS refused to comment on the hostage crisis, with a company executive saying that the issue was being handled by the external affairs ministry."

NEW DELHI: The external affairs ministry is investigating claims by expatriates in Ethiopia who say they are being held hostage by local staff that haven’t been paid after the financier Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd began defaulting on $12.6 billion in debt.Seven Indian workers from the shadow lender, which rocked financial markets after it began missing debt payments earlier this year, have been detained since November 25 at three sites in Ethiopia’s Oromia and Amhara states by unpaid local staff, according to an emailed letter from the employees.They said the possible termination of some road projects being built by Indian and Spanish joint ventures may have triggered local employees to panic. The workers said police and officials are taking the side of locals against the expatriate staff and that they were caught in the “middle of corporate disagreements, blame games and bureaucratic issues.”Oromia’s police commissioner general, Alemayehu Ejigu, the state’s deputy spokesman Deressa Terefe, and Amhara state’s spokesman Nigusu Tillahun didn’t immediately respond to two calls and two text messages.An official at the Indian embassy in the capital Addis Ababa said it was “closely following up with local Ethiopian authorities and IL&FS management to resolve the issue,” while a separate official in the foreign ministry in New Delhi confirmed they were looking into the matter. A spokesman for IL&FS declined to comment.“Concerns of project termination and absence of senior management from project camps might have triggered panic in local employees and led them to believe confining expat employees might force the organization to pay their salaries,” the employees wrote in a letter addressed to the Indian and Spanish ambassadors, as well as a number of Ethiopian ministries and the local World Bank representative.The son of detained IL&FS employee Sukhvinder Singh Khokher said his father has been in touch with the Indian embassy and there are efforts underway to try and get the local Ethiopian staff paid.""The local Ethiopian workers shut the gates and the local policeman support them,"" Satinder Pal Singh Khokher, who works for the Aditya Birla Group in Gujarat according to LinkedIn, said in an interview. “I have tweeted my concern to the Prime Minister of India.""According to the employees’ letter, management cited restrictions imposed by the Reserve Bank of India for its inability to send funds. IL&FS had defaulted on paying both taxes and local employee pensions for nine months, the letter said. Ethiopian Revenue Ministry spokesman Addis Yirga and Attorney General Office spokesman Zinabu Tunu said by phone they couldn’t comment on the employees’ concerns expressed in the letter.“We tried to reason with local employees and tried to assure that salaries will be paid in due course and restricting expat colleagues will not result in what they are trying to achieve.” the employees said in the letter.The detention of IL&FS employees in Ethiopia, who were reported to be working on road construction projects for joint ventures between IL&FS Transportation Networks Ltd and Spanish firms Elsamex SA and Ecoasfalt SA, illustrates the sprawling nature and global reach of the beleaguered infrastructure lender. The firm hasn’t stopped missing debt payments even after the Indian government fired the lender’s board and tapped well-known Indian banker Uday Kotak to help lead the firm’s recovery as the company reeled under $12.6 billion of debt.Representatives of Elsamex SA and Ecoasfalt SA in Spain were not immediately able to comment when contacted on their office numbers on Thursday.Several men identifying themselves as IL&FS employees in Ethiopia, who didn’t respond to requests for comment, have been tweeting Indian politicians asking for help.“We 7 employee from #ILFS are hostages by local labor/staff at in Ethiopia from last 4 days coz of nonpayment of creditors and local salaries,” Neeraj Raghuwanshi said in a tweet on November 27, in which he tagged Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “#ILFS denied to send fund from India. Kindly save us. Day2day situation worsening.”Raghuwanshi posted a screen grab of an email he wrote pleading for help, mentioning IL&FS’s local partner, the Ethiopian Roads Authority. He said the Authority would not take any action to help the detained employees before local staff were paid.Ethiopian Roads Authority director general Habtamu Tegegne didn’t immediately respond to two calls to his office phone. The Spanish ambassador to Ethiopia, Borja Montesino Martínez del Cerro, didn’t immediately respond to two emails seeking comment."

MUMBAI: After a month-long stir on the campus, the TISS administration filed an “incident report” to inform police about the disruption and to prevent loss of documents and damage to property. Students on the campus claimed the institute falsely accused them of vandalizing the registrar’s office, including breaking of CCTV facilities and other fixtures. A representation from the students said police entered the campus around 11.30am on Monday for a routine investigation.“We assured police that we did not indulge in any vandalizing acts and the allegation against us was baseless as the protest has remained non-violent since the beginning,” said a student.“This is perceived as an act of extreme moral deficit of the TISS administration. Instead of addressing our demands they have resorted to false narratives and intimidation tactics through the interference of police,” said the protesting students in a statement. They added that the students have gained higher resolve to continue the peaceful blockage of the administration block until the authorities agree to a ‘sincere’ meeting with the student body.TISS authorities claimed the students encroached upon the registrar’s office on March 23 and held a senior professor hostage till the wee hours of March 24.“The administrative wing of the institute is inaccessible to staff members. Keeping in mind the continuous disruptive tactics used by students, the institute filed the incident report. This is a preventive action initiated by the administration for the authorities to take note of the incidents and registered after nearly a month-long stir by a section of students. In view of the incident report, only one police officer visited the institute to take stock of the situation,” said the institute’s official statement. “It was an effort to prevent loss to property in the administrative office. We appeal to students not to disrupt normal functioning of the institute and desist from acts of vandalism,” it added. tnn"

NEW DELHI: Not all attempts to rescue Indian hostages abroad have ended on a sad note, unlike what happened with the 39 Indian labourers.Two high-profile cases, both in Iraq, were the release and repatriation of Indian truckers in 2004 and that of 46 Kerala nurses around the same time the 39 Indian workers were abducted.The nurses were kidnapped from a hospital in the Iraqi city of Tikrit. While foreign minister Sushma Swaraj contacted foreign ministers of almost every Gulf country to secure their release, a few Kerala businessmen are also said to have played a key role in convincing IS to free them.Similarly, three Indian truckers were abducted by anti-US fighters while on their way to Iraq from Kuwait in 2004. The then Manmohan Singh government managed to get them released after protracted negotiations headed by then junior foreign minister E Ahameds. It helped that the kidnappers were not anti-India.In another high-profile case, Father Tom Uzhunnalil of Kerala was released from Yemen with help from Oman in September 2017. Oman helped India secure his release after a request from the Vatican.In July 2016, Judith D’Souza, an Indian NGO worker who was abducted from Kabul in Afghanistan , was rescued."

NEW DELHI: Forget Turkey and Argentina . The rupee ’s real bugbear is the price of oil.India’s currency had its worst month in three years in August as crude rallied on speculation sanctions on Iran will shrink global supplies. The crude import bill for the world’s fastest-growing oil user surged 76 per cent in July from a year earlier to $10.2 billion. That pushed up the trade deficit to $18 billion, the most in five years.“Dollar demand for crude heading into Iran sanctions is not helping with rupee pressures,” said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in Singapore. “Demand for dollars is large, lumpy, and has been on an upward trend given the confluence of rising oil prices and actual demand pick-up for oil.”The rupee is Asia’s worst-performing currency this year, sliding 11 per cent and setting a string of record lows, most recently 71.96 per dollar on Wednesday. The pace of the decline has analysts scrambling to revise forecasts, with Mizuho changing its year-end estimate to 70.50 from an earlier prediction of 68.80.Brent, the benchmark of half the world’s oil including India’s, has jumped by more than 70 per cent from a low set in the middle of last year. The commodity is currently trading at $77.09 per barrel, a whisker below a three-year high of $80.50 reached in May.Rising oil prices will probably see India’s current-account deficit widen to 2.6 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) this financial year, from 1.5 per cent a year earlier, according to Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.“With the rupee having reached our year-end forecast of 71.5, the question is how much lower it can go,” head of research Khoon Goh and strategist Rini Sen wrote in a note on Wednesday. “The currency is still on the expensive side” and current fair value is around 73 per dollar, which suggests it will weaken further, they said.The rupee’s recent slide may have been exacerbated by month-end factors related to oil purchases, according to Commerzbank AG.“Last week, there were reports of strong month-end dollar demand, which may have accentuated the rupee’s decline,” analyst Charlie Lay wrote in a research note published Monday. Commerzbank is in the process of revising its rupee forecast and will probably lower it, he said.Weakness in the rupee has fueled speculation the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) may revisit a policy employed in 2013 of opening a foreign-exchange swap window to meet the entire daily dollar requirements of the nation’s oil-marketing companies.The RBI using this route will immediately remove about $600 million a day of demand from the foreign-exchange market, according to a note from Kotak Mahindra Bank. It will help reduce currency volatility but also push down reserves, it said.For now, state-owned refiners Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation and Hindustan Oil Corporation aren’t worried about central bank interference. The RBI hasn’t asked them to defer or stagger their dollar purchases for oil payments, an Indian Oil official familiar with the matter said last month.In Video: Petrol and diesel prices hit fresh high; no excise duty cut in offing"

Ludhiana: High drama was witnessed during a demolition drive in various areas under Zone C, when a building inspector of MC was held hostage by encroachers on Wednesday evening. The MC team from Zone C had gone for demolition of illegal shops, and one of the shop owners interrupted the drive and held the building inspector hostage The MC staff demolished around 32 under-construction and already constructed shops in different areas like Daba Road, Giaspura, and Lohara. The officials were dismantling shops in Krishna Colony, when one of the owners, Rajnish Tiwari, held the building inspector hostage and started indulging in an argument with him over the demolition of his shops. All arguments by the building inspector to make him understand that the commercial activity could not be carried out in the area — and the norms were not being fulfilled, due to which the commercial building plan could not be approved — failed to pacify him. The inspector was made to sit there on the site, and was not allowed to move along with machinery and other staff. The owners and other locals indulged in an argument with him, while asking the inspector to compensate for their loss.The assistant town planner of Zone C, Kuldip Mangat, said there was no building plan approval to these shops, and when they demolished the shops, some locals created a ruckus. He said the owner of these shops was not aware of the building bylaws, and moreover, he was objecting to the action by MC, saying the department had damaged their properties and caused a loss, for which they should be compensated. He said it was only when he reached the site and convinced the people, that the building inspector was released."

BHAGALPUR: Angry over non-functioning air conditioner (AC), passengers of the Delhi-bound 12367 UP Vikramshila Express, forcibly stopped the train for nearly half an hour at the Bhagalpur railway station by pulling the chain several times, on Sunday.Irate passengers also held the station superintendent (SS), Onkar Prasad, hostage on running train after he came to inquire about the delay in train’s departure at the platform. The GRP and the RPF finally rescued the SS at Sultanganj, nearly 30 km from Bhagalpur.Meanwhile, amidst ruckus the train moved ahead on its journey to Delhi (Anand Vihar terminal). Panic gripped railway authorities following the incident and soon the GRP and RPF were informed by local railway personnel besides higher authorities. Soon senior railway officers sent a technician on-board and got the AC repaired by the time the train reached Sultanganj.Prasad said, “We are inquiring the coach maintenance department and the people responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of coaches.”When asked whether the railways would be initiating legal action against the passengers, the SS said senior railway officials are aware of the situation and legal action would be taken as per the directives. Meanwhile, the railway passengers’ association has demanded an open public inquiry so that innocent passengers are not harassed. “The railways should be held responsible for poor maintenance of the coaches. One can only imagine how passengers would have suffered in the closed AC coach without an air conditioner."

Ghaziabad: Two armed robbers broke into the house of a BSNL engineer in Ghaziabad on Wednesday. The incident took place at the two-storey house of Upendra Teotia in Govindpuram at around 2 pm and the masked robbers allegedly took the owner’s grandson hostage.The men allegedly entered the ground floor of the house posing as courier delivery boys. Teotia (56), a junior engineer, was in his office in Raj Nagar at the time of the incident and his two sons were out for work.The robbers allegedly threatened Teotia’s younger daughter-in-law Beenu(32) who lives on the ground floor.“The men entered and knocked on the door of the ground floor. Beenu opened the wooden door when the men said they had arrived to deliver a courier. The men forced open the wire mesh door by kicking against it as soon as she opened the wooden door. They picked up my grandson and held a knife to his neck. They threatened to slit his throat if Beenu did not hand over valuables kept inside the house. They took her inside one of the rooms and forced her to hand over all the jewelry she was wearing. The men also forced her to open an almirah and searched inside for valuables,” said Teotia. Beenu shouted for help after the men left following which Teotia’s older daughter-in-law rushed downstairs.On the basis of a complaint lodged by Teotia’s family, Ghaziabad police registered an FIR under IPC section 392 (loot) in Kavi Nagar police station against unidentified persons.“We are scanning CCTV footage of the area.

AGRA: Suresh Kumar , 56, owner of the house in Etah ’s Yadavnagar area where a former havaldar with the 1871 Rocket regiment of the artillery, Avadesh Yadav , held six people, including Kumar and his daughter, hostage at gunpoint, can’t get over those 20 nerve-shattering hours. One of the first things Kumar did after their ordeal came to an end was to lodge an FIR against his tenant, who was on Wednesday booked under IPC sections 307 (attempt to murder), 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement).“I’ll never forget those 20 hours. It was terrifying and chaotic. On Monday afternoon, Yadav forced us upstairs at gunpoint and locked us up. He said that the enemy had surrounded us and it was time to retaliate. We tried to calm him down, but he did not listen to us,"" Kumar said, recalling events of the day before.After his retirement in January 2014, Yadav’s family had been living in Kumar's two-storey house as tenants. Though he worked in Delhi, he often visited his wife and children there. ""The whole family was always very polite and humble. I don’t know how such a peaceful man suddenly turned into a maniac,” Kumar told TOI on Wednesday.Kumar owns two houses — one in Jodhpura village where he lives with his wife and another in Yadavnagar where his two children, 20-year-old Poonam and 8-year-old Sachin, share the premises with Yadav's family. “It is a two-storey building. The ground floor is occupied by my children, the first floor by the Yadav family and the second one by another family, which was not present in the house on Monday. I have already sent my children to my other house and have asked the Yadav family to look for another place on rent,” Kumar said.On Monday, Kumar had come to his Yadavnagar house to check on his children. “Thankfully, Sachin was still in school. I and my daughter were about to have lunch when I heard gunshots. When I looked up, I saw Yadav holding his .315 bore rifle which was aimed at me. He locked every door in the house. He made his father, wife, two children, me and my daughter sit on the staircase and didn’t let us move. He ordered us to stay quiet.”The hostage situation had ended after a SWAT team aided by 60 policemen from Etah eventually managed to enter the house and restrain Yadav, who has now been sent to jail."

rabies

I was coming out of the house. A dog jumped on my bike and bit my leg. The dog refused to leave my leg. Due to the impact, I fell off the bike. Fortunately, my head was safe Manohar, cook for 10 years at a house in the society

Following their complaints, our team went to the society and vaccinated the dogs. As per guidelines, we have to leave dogs back in the area. We can keep stray dogs under observation only if they show symptoms of rabies. ” Pratap Rathod, superintendent of Cattle Nuisance Control Department

For over two weeks now, septuagenarian Dipti Shah has been in self-imposed house arrest of sorts. As far as possible, she avoids going out of her residence. Reason: stray dog menace. She is not alone. Occupants of each of the 75 houses in Tulsi Row House inarea share her fear. Their fears are not unfounded.A fortnight ago, Shah had to leave forby an early morning flight when she was bitten by a dog. ""Just after I stepped out of my house to get into the car, a dog came running from nowhere and bit me hard even before I could register anything. I had to rush to the doctor and my travel plans fell flat,"" reveals Shah. Ever since, she is reluctant to step out, especially if she is alone.Residents claim that at least 10 people have been bitten by stray dogs since December last year. Repeated requests to thehave fallen on deaf ears. Such is the terror that even domestic helps, newspaper and vegetable vendors and cooks refuse to enter the society, they say.Revealing his ordeal, Anant Vaidya (65) says, ""I was going out with my wife when a bunch of dogs attacked me. My wife used her presence of mind and shooed them away."" He avers that the menace affects their society more as majority of the residents are senior citizens.Recalling another incident of dog bite which also became a huge embarrassment, he said that one of the guests at a wedding ceremony in the society was attacked. ""He was the son-in-law of the family. They were to go on a leisure trip to, but had to cancel the trip because of the incident,"" says Vaidya. He claims he had made several complaints to AMC about this menace but nothing happened about it. ""Being senior citizens, we would love to take a stroll in the society and outside. We could do that six months ago, but now we don't dare to walk around anymore. We also do not allow children to play in the society,"" he adds.Manoharsinh Rathod, a cook at one of the houses in the society for last 10 years, had a narrow escape when he was chased by a dog. ""After finishing my work on May 25, I was coming out of the house. A dog jumped on my bike and bit my leg. The dog refused to leave my leg. Due to the impact, I fell off the bike. Fortunately, my head was safe,"" he said. While he has resumed work at other places, he has refused to go back to this society, at least for now.AMC officials said that they can hardly do anything about it. Confirming receipt of the complaint, Pratap Rathod, superintendent of Cattle Nuisance Control Department (CNCD) of AMC, said, ""Following their complaints, our team went to the society and vaccinated the dogs. As per guidelines, we have to leave dogs back in the area we pick them from. We can keep stray dogs under observation only if they show symptoms of. In this case, we did not observe any such symptom and so we left them back in the area.""The number of dog bites in the city has seen an increase over the years. In 2015, AMC registered 50,209 cases of dog bite.The number rose to 52,639 in 2016 and to 56,180 in 2017. In the first four months of 2018, as many as 22,593 cases were reported."

CHANDIGARG: Smog kept air and train passengers on tenterhooks for the fourth consecutive day on Friday. While 12 trains and nine flights arrived late at Chandigarh, timings of 10 flights from Chandigarh International Airport had to be rescheduled due to poor visibility.Kalka Shatabdi Express was once again late by around three hours. The train arrived at Chandigarh at 1.55pm against the scheduled arrival time of 11.05am.Unchahaar Express running between Lucknow and Chandigarh reached the city beautiful after a delay of over 13 hours. Kalka Mail, Lucknow-Chandigarh Express and Bandra-Chandigarh Express reached six, three and five hours late, respectively.The officials at Chandigarh Railway Station said the long distance trains have been running late for the past three days. The dense smog in Delhi has been delaying all the trains, added an official.Out of nine flights which arrived late at the airport, seven flights were from Delhi. The other two flights were from Mumbai, said the spokesperson of Chandigarh International Airport Limited (CHIAL).The officials said that bad weather conditions prevailing since the onset of winters have reduced the visibility and Delhi is the worst affected.The poor visibility at Chandigarh airport also delayed the departure of 10 flights out of which six were Delhi-bound flights. GoAir, Jet Airways , Vistara flights saw late departure by 10 minutes to 54 minutes, said the spokesperson.Bad weather has been giving hiccups to the airline operators at Chandigarh as the Airport Authority of India is yet to upgrade the CAT-ILS (Instruments Landing System) at the airport.Delay in installation of CAT-ILS at the airport adds up to the delayed flight operations. The Airport Authority of India has extended the Notam (notice to airmen) till February 27, after the instrument landing system (ILS) installed on the runway developed a problem last week. Notam disallows aircraft to land with visibility below 2,400m, said an official.Timings go off trackFlight From Delay Spice Jet Delhi 30 minutesJet Airways Delhi 35 minutesSpice Jet Delhi 28 minutesJet Airways Delhi 60 minutesIndigo Delhi 22 minutesJet Airways Mumbai 35 minutesAir India Delhi 10 minutesJet Airways/KLM Mumbai 50 minutesJet Airways Delhi 15 minutesTrain Scheduled arrival DelayKalka Mail (12311) 3 am 6:04 hoursJaipur-CHD (19717) 4:55 am 0:42 hoursBarmer Exp (14888) 5:10 am 2:41 hoursIndore-Chandigarh 6:45 am 0:54 hoursUnchahaar Exp (14217) 9:25 am 13:31 hoursAmritsar Exp (12242) 9:25 am 0:52 hoursSadhbhavna Exp (12231) 10:10 am 3:13 hoursHimalayan Queen 10:25 am 1:30 hoursKalka Shatabdi (12011) 11:05 am 2:50 hoursLucknow Exp (15011) 3 pm 2:41 hoursPashchim Exp (23255) 3:57 pm 1:26 hoursBandra-Chandigarh 4:20 pm 5:08 hours"

HYDERABAD: A series of fatal accidents reported in the recent past has yet again turned the spotlight on Hyderabad's unruly traffic situation that, road users fear, is only getting worse by the day . Enraged by the frequency of violations, residents say how a sizeable population of the city's motorists not only pay little heed to traffic rules but also have no fear of the law.Be it over speeding, particu larly during late hours of the day , jumping lanes without the use of indicators, drink and cellphone driving or not using safety gears (helmet, seatbelt etc), motorists in the city are spotted resorting to all forms of violation, the traffic personnel's routine checks and challans notwithstanding.Hyderabad figures among the top 10 cities in India that record the highest number of road accidents every year, comes as no surprise. According to the Accidents India Report of 2016, the year saw as many as 3,000 (approx.) road accidents being reported from the city .“Driving through most parts of Hyderabad is a nightmare. Motorists have no respect for traffic signals or the cops posted at these junctions. They do not even care about other motorists on the road. I have lived in multiple cities and nowhere have I seen such rash drivers who have no sense of lane driving or speed limits,“ said a Prateek Prakash , a banker who moved to the city three years ago.The Madhapur resident added: “And it isn't just cabs and buses that violate norms, even those driving private cars, many of them top-end brands, behave much the same way .“Experts working in the area of road safety , couldn't agree more. Venting their angst against those resorting to such unruliness on the roads, they said how such occurrences show Hyderabad ­ aspiring to be a world-class city ­ in very poor light. “This is supposed to be a cosmopolitan city . But unless the people of the city realise that such attitude is unacceptable and must be amended, it is going to be difficult for Hyderabad to progress,“ said KRM Hari, assistant city planner, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC).And it isn't the busy and congested stretches of the city alone that report rampant traffic violations. Even pockets with sufficient carriageway ­ including the expressways and ring road ­ are ridden with the same menace.“The Paradise Junction in Secunderabad is particularly horrifying. Almost every day I feel insecure while driving through this junction that has cars coming in from all directions,“ said Alpa Gupta , a TATA projects employee.Stressing the need for a change in attitude of commuters, traffic policemen say that it is the only way to address the situation. “We need to adopt defensive driving techniques and be aware of the pockets in the city where the traffic flow is generally heavy . Citizens have to be more proactive to ensure that the rate of accidents is curtailed,“ said A V Ranganath , deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Hyderabad."

WASHINGTON: Pakistan is virtually holding an American diplomat hostage after preventing him from boarding a US military plane sent to bring him out of Islamabad, where he is sequestered at the US Embassy while the two sides are locked in a dispute over his diplomatic status and immunity issues.Fraying ties between once-close allies saw a few more threads snap this weekend after what appeared to be a failed American rescue mission aimed at airlifting Col Joseph Emanuel Hall, a defence attaché at the US Embassy in Islamabad. Hall is accused of running a red light on April 7 while driving an SUV and knocking over a Pakistani national on a motorcycle, killing him.When Hall’s credentials describe him as a diplomat, thus implying he enjoys immunity, Pakistan is contesting it even as the issue has become mired in local courts. At the very least, if Washington cannot waive the diplomatic immunity to enable him to be prosecuted in Pakistan, Islamabad wants a commitment that he will be tried in the US courts after he returns to America.However, hardline elements in Pakistan are insisting that he be prosecuted in Pakistan. On Saturday, the Trump administration appeared to have won a reprieve from the more moderate elements in Pakistan who are keen to repair the damage the dispute has caused, and a C-130 military transport plane was sent from Bagram Air Force Base in Afghanistan to the Nur Khan Air Base in Chaklala outside Rawalpindi , to extricate Col Hall.But word of the mission was leaked to the Pakistani media, and the jihadi press ran amuck with wall-to-wall coverage of what was virtually a rescue effort. When Col Hall reached the airbase with eight people from the U.S Embassy accompanying him, he was refused permission to board the aircraft, ostensibly under instructions from hardline elements of the Pakistan establishment. The aircraft eventually returned to Bagram.Both sides have declined to comment on the matter, but the Dawn newspaper reported on Sunday, under the headline ''US diplomat’s bid to fly out of Pakistan foiled,'' that the Islamabad high court had a day earlier turned down a petition by the victim Ateeq Baig’s father seeking a direction for the government to put the diplomat’s name on the Exit Control List. Noting that Hall enjoyed diplomatic immunity, the court, however, asked the government to decide within two weeks whether or not Col Hall should be placed on the Exit Control List.Col.Hall’s credentials, widely reproduced in the media, shows his diplomatic credentials are set to expire on May 31, 2018. The effort seems to be to keep him in Pakistan till that time.The latest spat comes amid deteriorating ties between the two countries, with both sides restricting the movement of each other’s diplomats in their respective capitals, and the Trump administration seemingly determined to punish Pakistan for its terrorist infractions.Earlier in the week, Islamabad made a song and dance about the UN Al-Qaida/ISIL Sanctions Committee not approving Pakistan’s proposal to list Umer Khalid Khorasani, aka Abdul Wali, the leader of Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, ostensibly because of US objection, although Pakistan itself continues to shield terrorists such as Hafiz Saeed and Masood Azhar."

DHAKA: Armed militants killed 20 civilians after taking them hostage in a Bangladesh cafe overnight and many of the victims were hacked to death, an army spokesman said on Saturday.""We've recovered 20 bodies. Most them had been brutally hacked to death with sharp weapons,"" Brigadier General Nayeem Ashfaq Chowdhury told reporters in Dhaka, without giving the nationality of the victims.All 20 civilians who were killed in the attack on Dhaka cafe were foreigners, Reuters reported quoting Bangladesh army officials.were also rescued at the end of the siege in an upmarket neighbourhood of the capital Dhaka, including three foreigners.""Three of those who were rescued were foreigners, including one Japanese and two Sri Lankans,"" said the spokesman.Officials had earlier said thatand one was captured alive when security forces stormed the cafe on Saturday morning while two police officers were slain in a firefight that erupted at the beginning of the siege on Friday night.The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors jihadis activity online. A news agency affiliated with the Islamic Group claimed that 24 people had been killed and 40 wounded, including foreigners, according to SITE. The figures could not be independently confirmed.Police said the gunmen attacked the Holey Artisan restaurant in the Gulshan district of Dhaka, popular with expatriates, in an assault that began around 9pm local time on Friday. The assailants exchanged sporadic gunfire with police outside for several hours after the attack.The hostage crisis marks an escalation from a recent spate of murders claimed by Islamic State and al-Qaida on liberals, gays, foreigners and religious minorities, and could deal a major blow to the country's vital $25 billion garment sector.The restaurant assault also comes after Bangladesh hanged an Islamist party leader, Motiur Rahman Nizami, on May 11 for genocide and other crimes committed during a 1971 war of independence from Pakistan. That has drawn an angry reaction and some scattered violence from supporters. Nizami, 73, was a former legislator and minister during opposition leader Khaleda Zia's last term as prime minister.Last year, several Western retailers temporarily halted visits to Dhaka following the killing of two foreigners.Earlier on Friday, awas hacked to death at a temple in Jhinaidah district, 300km (188 miles) southwest of Dhaka.Both Islamic State and al Qaeda have claimed responsibility for many of the killings, although local authorities say no operational links exist between Bangladeshi militants and international jihadi networks.Bangladesh security officials say two local militant groups, Ansar-al-Islam and Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen, are behind the violence. Ansar pledges allegiance to al-Qaida, while Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen claims it represents Islamic State.""The bottom line is Bangladesh has plenty of local, often unaffiliated, militants and radicals happy to stage attacks in ISIS 's name,"" said Michael Kugelman, South Asia associate at The Wilson Centre in Washington DC, using an acronym commonly used for Islamic State.Islamic State had claimed more attacks in Bangladesh than in Pakistan or Afghanistan, he said.In Video: 20 killed in Dhaka cafe attack, 13 rescued"

Ferozepur: A field officer of Punjab Agriculture Development Bank (PADB) was allegedly taken hostage by nearly 300 farmers on Saturday, when he had gone to Mehma village, 22km from here, to recover installments from cultivators who had defaulted on farm debts.The field officer, Peeyush Bansal, was released a few hours later, after police intervened and assured the farmers of the bank not sending any more officials to recover overdue loan amounts.On the basis of a complaint submitted by PADB manager Ved Parkash, a case was registered against Mehma-based farmer Harnek Singh, who allegedly led the mob, and several unidentified people at Lakho Ke Behram police station on Sunday, according to SHO Ashok Kumar, the investigating officer of the case.The cop confirmed that no arrest had been made so far. The SHO said they could not take any action against the mob because just getting Bansal out of the hostage situation was difficult. “We could not have made any arrests at that time. People were angry, and police action at such a time could have led to a law-and-order situation,” he said.The farmers have said the bank official was insensitive and used “indecent language”, and this angered them so much that they took him hostage. Farmers from the village claimed that the government had asked bank employees not to go to houses of farmers for forcibly recovering loans, but they had not stopped visiting them.The case has been registered under sections 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions) and 342 (wrongful confinement) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).In his statement to the police, the bank manager said Harnek Singh had already been booked by the police for detaining bank officials by locking a bank from inside at Guru Har Sahai in January. However, no arrest was made in that case too."

NEW DELHI: The IL&FS hostage crisis in Ethiopia appeared far from over despite the distressed group on Monday transferring money to pay one month’s salary. The Indian expats held hostage were not released as the local workers are demanding that IL&FS Transportation Network Ltd-Elsamex clear dues for two months — October and November.Sources told TOI the company is in contact with local authorities and Ethiopian police to arrange for a safe passage for its Indian employees who are under house arrest in their camps, while IL&FS arranges for more funds to settle the salary dues.At least five Indian expats working for two road projects in Ethiopia have now been captive for over a week as ITNL and Elsamex have failed to clear salary and other statutory payments for several months. The Indian expats also have unpaid salary claims since July with some of the arrears dating back to April.An IL&FS spokesperson declined to comment.Sources, however, said that efforts have been mounted to arrange funds at a war footing. On Friday, Exim Bank of India asked Commercial Bank of Ethiopia to come to the rescue of IL&FS.“Exim Bank is agreeable to permit the withdrawal from the accounts, after they are adequately funded, towards meeting immediate pressing dues, that is, payment of salary, statutory and local dues in Ethiopia,” Exim Bank deputy managing director Debasish Mallick told TOI.Exim Bank had invoked guarantee amount $31.7 million and guarantee commission of over $285,000 due to the problems at the IL&FS Group, which have led to a series of repayment defaults. But the amount in the bank account was not sufficient with just around $230,000 at the end of November."

MANILA: Muslim militants have threatened to kill three more hostages in their jungle base in the southern Philippines more than a week after beheading a Canadian man when their multimillion dollar ransom demands were not met.In a video circulated on Tuesday by the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors jihadi websites, the captives from Canada, Norway and the Philippines pleaded for the Canadian and Philippine governments to heed the Abu Sayyaf militants' demand.Six heavily armed Abu Sayyaf jihadists stood behind the hostages, who were made to sit in a clearing and spoke briefly before a camera. A black flag hang in the backdrop of banana trees and lush foliage.Norwegian hostage Kjartan Sekkingstad said that if the kidnappers' demand was not met, ""we will be executed like our friend John.""The militants beheaded John Ridsdel on April 25 in the southern Philippine province of Sulu, an impoverished Muslim province in the south of the largely Roman Catholic country, after they failed to get a ransom of 300 million pesos ($6.3 million).Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned the killing but vowed not to give in to the kidnappers' ransom demands. Following the beheading, the Philippine military launched an offensive, which security officials believe have killed more than a dozen gunmen so far.Canadian captive Robert Hall asked the Philippine government to ""please stop shooting at us and trying to kill us. They're gonna do a good job at that."" He asked his government to heed the militants' demand.Holding back tears, Filipino Marites Flor asked several officials and prominent Philippine personalities, including local presidential candidates, for help ""because we want to be freed alive.""A masked militant warned Canada and the Philippines that the three remaining hostages would be killed ""if you procrastinate once again.""It was the first time, the three captives were shown in a video after Ridsdel's killing.The four were seized from a marina on southern Samal Island and taken by boat to Sulu, where Abu Sayyaf gunmen continue to hold several captives, including a Dutch bird watcher who was kidnapped more than three years ago, and eight Indonesian and Malaysian crewmen who were snatched recently from three tugboats.The militants freed 10 Indonesian tugboat crewmen a few days ago reportedly in exchange for ransom.The United States and the Philippines have separately blacklisted the Abu Sayyaf for kidnappings for ransom, beheadings and bombings. The brutal group emerged in the early 1990s as an extremist offshoot of a decades-long Muslim separatist rebellion in the south."

BHOPAL: A trigger-happy husband allegedly took a student and guard hostage at gunpoint in a school in MP’s Bhind because his wife refused to drop her class and leave with him. He fired shots in the air as he walked out of campus, threatening a massacre, witnesses have told police.The shooter, Kishan Shakya , is on the run with a .315 rifle and, by the looks of it, plenty of ammunition. He, too, is a teacher. Guns — even gunfire — are an everyday sight for the people of Bhind, a district in Chambal region with the largest number of licensed firearms (22,800), but the school shooting rattled them as well.Police said Kishan and his wife Aradhna Verma have a strained relationship and are living separately for the last few months. On Saturday, Kishan landed up at Gata Middle School, where Aradhna teaches. It was 11am and the school was holding an exam. Aradhna was in a classroom when she saw her husband barge in, armed with a rifle and shouting for her. She tried to run but he grabbed her and demanded that she come with him, say police.Aradhna refused and fled to the teachers’ room where she locked herself in. Furious, Kishan allegedly tried to go after her but guard Nathuram Bothom blocked him, only to have the rifle barrel poking his chest. A Class IX student, Jaiveer Gurjar, bravely came forward to defend his teacher and told Kishan point-blank to “stop terrorizing the school”.In reply, Kishan allegedly placed the barrel on his chest and told him to step aside. The guard and student stood their ground. Frustrated, Kishan allegedly fired a few shots in the air and walked out, warning that he would return and “kill everyone”.“I was in the classroom when he stormed in, grabbed my wrist and tried to drag me along. I resisted and rushed into another room and bolted it from inside. He created a scene outside the room and took the guard and a student at gunpoint,” his wife Anuradha told mediapersons. Jaiveer said: “He was trying to take our teacher forcefully. When I objected and reminded him that it was a school, he pointed his gun at me.”Mehgaon police station in-charge Narendra Tripathi said that a case has been registered against Kishan on the basis of the statements of his wife, the guard and student. “It seems that there are differences between the husband and wife. We are investigating it and hope to nab him,” Tripathi told TOI.When the news spread in the region, some parents approached the school authorities and said that they won’t send their kids until security arrangements are made."

AGRA: Police initiatives to curb crime in the city are being challenged by the criminals, as a group of armed robbers barged inside a local businessman home and held him and his mother hostage at gunpoint before making away with valuables and cash over Rs 3 lakh.The incident took place in Bombay Market (M S Complex) area of Jagdispura on Sikandra-Bodla Road at around afternoon.Manoj Sharma, who lives on the second floor of M S complex along with his mother, said, “On Monday, a couple of men came to our apartment for a permission to set up ‘ bhandara ’ in front of our building. The same men along with two others barged inside our home and robbed us. In the confrontation, one of the robbers suffered bullet injury after his pistol misfired, but all the four managed to run away.”“They locked us in the bathroom and took away Rs 1.5 lakh cash, four gold rings, one chain and other items,” said Sharma.According to superintendent of police Agra city Kunwar Anupam Singh, “It was a pre-planned robbery. The robbers had recced the victim’s apartment and surrounding area. They knew that currently only two people live in the apartment and the victim is a businessman who owns the complex as well.”“Police have cordoned off the area and teams are working to nab the accused. It is very much possible the robbers may visit any private clinic or hospital for first aid, as one of them have suffered bullet injury. As soon any lead is received, we will act accordingly,” he said.Last year, 278 home break-in and 129 loot incidents were reported, including at least three cases of armed robbers attacking family members to rob them in their home."

AGRA: As a havaldar with the 1871 Rocket regiment of the Artillery, Avadesh Yadav 's job was to provide cover fire to the infantry. In the 20 hours that he held his wife Meena, daughter Priya, son Ankul, wife Meena and father Ramadin hostage at gun point along with two members of his landlord's family in Etah, those images must have played on his mind. He kept saying, ""Dushmano ne gher liya...piche haato...mein cover fire deta hoon (Enemies have surrounded us, step back, I will give cover fire)"". And then he would fire a round.The long, frightening night for the family of Yadav and his landlord at Yadavnagar, Etah (UP), that began on Monday came to an end on Tuesday after a SWAT team quickly scrambled together by the administration and aided by 60 policemen slithered down the terrace and apprehended him. The security personnel had refrained from taking more drastic action against the former soldier as he was trained and armed with a 315 bore rifle from which he had fired 11 shots.Priya, 18, and Ankul, 15, meanwhile established contact with cops outside, who told them to try and somehow hide their father's gun. The moment they did that, the SWAT team that had already made its way to the terrace came down and pinned him to the ground.After a preliminary investigation, police said Yadav, who retired in January 2014 from Nasirabad, seemed to have ""lost his mental balance that may have been triggered by something"". Sanjay Kumar, deputy superintendent of police, Etah, told TOI: “On Monday, at around 2.30 pm, Awadesh Yadav held hostage six persons, including his family members and landlord, at gunpoint. He fired shots (in the air) after which personnel from five police stations, fire brigade and a SWAT team were roped it. We tried to persuade Yadav, but he refused to listen. It took 60 cops to capture him and end the drama.”Kumar added,“Yadav, who was working with Bharat Petroleum in Delhi, seemed to be mentally unstable so we had to rule out offensive measures. That was also because six innocent people were being held hostage by him. We finally managed to contact his two teenage children and asked them to hide his rifle. Once the kids confirmed to us that they had successfully done that, our teams barged in from the roof and later the ground floor. We were ready with grill cutters and all men entered the house at one go.”On the condition of anonymity, an immediate neighbour of Yadav said, “Yadav came to Etah on Sunday evening by bus as his family followed him in a car. Yadav had fired shots in his Delhi residence too. On Monday afternoon, he suddenly picked up his gun and fired again. Before anyone could understand anything, he took his family and landlord hostage. The family is in trauma.”Station officer of Kotwali Nagar police station Pankaj Kumar Mishra said, “On Saturday, too, Yadav had fired in his rented home (in Delhi). He was working for Bharat Petroleum at their Dwarka office. His landlord panicked and called for the ex-Armyman's family in Etah to fetch him from Delhi. While heading home, Yadav took his gun along and boarded a UP roadways bus. He believed his family would kill him.”Kamlesh Yadav, the younger brother of Awadesh, said, “Nearly a decade ago, a similar incident had forced us to take him to hospital, but after brief a period of medication he was normal. However, he would often say that enemies have surrounded us and we need to retaliate.”A military source said, “Since Awadesh retired nearly four years ago, we don’t know about his medical record during service in the Army.”"

BHUBANESWAR: With cash in short supply, a group of villagers in Kalahandi district decided to take matters into their own hands.Villagers in Kasibahal on Saturday took sarpanch Balabhadra Patel hostage, demanding kerosene in exchange of paddy. The villagers freed him after a five-hour drama and only after getting assurance from block development officer ( BDO ) Raghunath Mundary that he would facilitate the sale of paddy so that the villagers could buy kerosene.Reports claimed the villagers had gone to the local panchayat demanding that they be given kerosene in exchange of paddy since they don't have money to buy it. They are mostly labourers who don't have their own farmland. They get paid in cash and a portion of the paddy they help harvest in the agricultural fields of big landlords. Since money has been a problem this time, landlords have been unable to hand them cash and the marginal farmers had to settle for paddy instead.In Kasibahal 98 per cent of the people depend on farming. The panchayat comes under Koksara block, where there are three ATMs, including one operated by the State Bank of India. Kasibahal village is about 20 km from the block headquarters, and is serviced by only one ATM.""As landlords too are struggling to arrange funds, they have been unable to give cash to the marginal farmers. Moreover, the ATMs too have been unable to meet the requirement otherwise the villagers would have had some cash to buy essential items like kerosene,"" Mundary told TOI.The villagers demanded that they be given kerosene in exchange of paddy. But the panchayat doesn't indulge in barter system. Enraged, the villagers then took the sarpanch hostage.""We have never given kerosene by taking paddy in return. This is against the rule,"" said the BDO adding he has discussed the issue with the Primary Agricultural Credit Society (Pacs), which buys paddy from farmers on minimum support price (MSP) fixed by the government, since marginal farmers are not registered to sell their paddy in PACS mandis."

LUCKNOW: Infuriated over continuous disruption of proceedings of the state assembly by protesting members of the Samajwadi Party for the second consecutive day on Friday, an agitated chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi warned them for holding the House hostage and pleaded Speaker Hridaya Narain Dixit to take serious note of it.Yogi said the Opposition is running away from the House as they fear that their scandals and corruption in their regime would get exposed. “Why this behaviour when they all decided at the all-party meeting to let the House function smoothly,” asked Yogi.Earlier, amidst slogan shouting and uproarious scenes despite repeated reminders from the chair and parliament affairs minister Suresh Khanna to keep calm, SP MLAs led by Ram Govind Chaudhary and Azam Khan demanded withdrawal of the increase in power tariff and refused to retreat leading to adjournment of house till Monday.The first two days of the winter Assembly session have been consigned to pandemonium with SP and Congress MLAs running into the Well of the House.On the first day of the Assembly on Thursday Yogi left the House amidst display of banners slogan shouting by the Opposition, after having failed to address the House.On Friday, as portests broke out again, Yogi mounted an attack on them by warning that this is not the way to run the House. “How can just a handful od 47 members (of the Samajwadi Party) hijack the entire functioning. This is denial of democratic rights of others and issues related to people. I would request the Speaker to take note of it seriously,” the CM said.“When the government is ready to face any question from the Opposition and give replies, why are they running away from a debate? Are they Afraid of their scams getting exposed?” he asked.Yogi said the Opposition is unnecessarily blowing the issue of power tariff increase out of proportion as the state government is providing cheapest electricity with increased supply hours.Later, in an informal interaction with mediapersons, Yogi said the Samajwadi Party led-Opposition was indulging in slogan shouting and raising the power tariff issue merely to hog headlines."

NEW DELHI: When the white Indica drew near their white Swift Dzire, the two men holding a scared Delhi University student hostage inside got out to get their hands on the ransom they had demanded. For half an hour that Thursday night, Mohammad Rafee and Akash, fearing a police trap, had got the Indica to follow them from the original ransom drop spot at Shastri Nagar to a lonely park in Bhajanpura. When the door of the Indica opened, out stepped a child, or so it seemed. As the two parties eyed each other warily, the young hostage loosened himself from his abductors’ grip, and before they could react, gun shots rang out.On the other side, Ayisha Falaq, 33, trembled, her .32 bore pistol still hot in her hand. The national-level shooter-cum-coach had shot one of the men on his waist, the other in his foot. She had instinctively pulled out the licensed gun she habitually carried in her purse and shot at the men who had held her 21-year-old brother-in-law Asif hostage for five hours. “When we got the ransom call, Ayisha was afraid, but insisted that it would be she who would hand over the money to Asif’s abductors,” Falaq Sher Alam, Ayisha’s husband, told TOI on Saturday.Recalling the frantic moment, Ayisha said, “Asif was shocked to see me shooting at the men. He immediately ran towards me and held me tight. He was shivering with fear, and so was I.” Police, who had been following Ayisha and her husband, swooped in and collared the injured Rafee and Akash before they could hobble their way to the Dzire.The cops have seized the pistol from Ayisha. “Investigation is in progress to establish whether Ayisha fired the shots in self-defence to save Asif’s life. If it is so, she will be protected under the law,” said Ravindra Yadav, joint commissioner (Eastern Range).Asif had been taken hostage by the two men earlier that night. A student of Delhi University by day, Asif earned some pocket money by driving a cab after classes. On Thursday night, he got a booking in Daryaganj and left his home at Minto Road to pick up Rafee and Akash. Halfway, they asked him to take a different route and he protested, but they brusquely told him to shut up.“I immediately stopped the car and refused to go ahead from that point,” said the 21-year-old. One of the men shoved him to the front passenger seat and threatened to kill him. “The men laughed in an evil manner and asked me to enjoy the last moments of my life,” said Asif, still shivering at the memory.At Bhopra border, the men stopped the car and took Asif’s wallet, only to find it held just Rs 150. Angered that their efforts had yielded so little, Rafee and Akash beat the youngster and forced him to make a ransom call to his family.“Around 1 am we received a call from Asif’s phone,” remembered Ayisha. “Someone asked us to reach Shastri Park in an hour with Rs 25,000 if we wanted to see Asif alive.” Family members first thought Asif was playing a prank on them. But the seriousness of the situation quickly sank in and they immediately called the police control room.“The cops asked us to go to Shastri Park with the money. They said they would deploy plainclothes men at the designated spot,” said Alam. When Ayisha and her husband reached there, the kidnappers suspected the presence of cops and drove away. Alam tailed the car, and was, in turn, discreetly followed by the cops.Police were on the spot almost as soon as Ayisha had shot the goons. “Officer Anant Mittal, an IPS trainee, and his team arrived when the shooting was taking place,” said Joint CP Yadav. “The two men tried to escape despite being injured, but they were nabbed.” Senior police officers applauded the bravery of the woman shooter in rescuing her relative.In Video: Delhi: Woman shoots abductors, rescues hostage"

KOLKATA: A cave-in in the western flank of Diamond Harbour Road in Thakupukur around 6am on Thursday led to a massive snarl on the vital north-south corridor. A retinue of engineers and police personnel swung into action to salvage the situation. The road was already distressed due the construction of the Joka-BBD Bag Metro corridor.Currently, both-way traffic is directed along the western flank of the road as the eastern flank being concretized. More than 20sqft area of the road sunk in around 5ft deep on the 90ft flank, leaving only one lane left for the movement of vehicles. Even after the cops diverted the office-bound vehicles around James Long Sarani the snarl lasted the entire day.Prima facie it seems the cave-in might be a result of the subsidence of sand after the laying the sewage line under the Kolkata Environment Improvement project. “A void might have been created due to water leakage. We are trying ascertain the exact cause and come up with a remedy,” said an engineer.Jitesh Roy of Dakshinpara, whose house is not far from the spot, left his home in panic till the KMC engineers assured him of no further possibility of cave-in. “I feared the house would collapse with us inside,” said Roy. A KMC engineer said the cave-in might progress southwards. “We have taken all precautionary measures.”Local councillor Ghanashree Bag said the collapse may be due to improper landfill."

A top Indian diplomat's five-year-old son was briefly held hostage in Durban after armed robbers invaded his official residence on Thursday. Official sources here confirmed the incident but said no physical harm was caused to anyone.India has officially taken up the issue of security for its diplomats with the South African government.According to agency reports, the family of India's consul-general in Durban, Shashank Vikram , members of his domestic staff and a visiting teacher were held up at their residence on Innes Road. Among them were two children, aged five and 10. ""They are OK but they were obviously traumatised,"" said consul S K Pandey. ""Nobody suffered physical harm,"" he said.A domestic worker's cellphone, which was robbed, could provide clues to the incident of the robbery in the home of India's consul-general in Durban, the Independent Online reported.""A catastrophic lapse in security for such a high-profile diplomatic family is now being investigated at the highest levels after the consul general's official residence, India House, in Morningside, was breached for the first time in its long history, and seemingly so easily,"" it said in its report.The robbers reportedly gained entry by derailing the entrance gate, a strategy used often in a spate of brazen robberies recently in affluent suburbs north of Durban.In response to queries on the armed intrusion, MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said, ""Ensuring the safety and security of Indian diplomats/officials posted abroad and their families is a matter of highest priority for us. In the context of the incident, we have taken up the matter with the relevant authorities, and investigations are currently ongoing. We expect that the intruders will be arrested soon. External affairs minister has spoken to the consul general and inquired about the well-being of his family.""Following the incident, India reminded South Africa of its duty to protect diplomatic staff and property, under the Vienna Convention. ""Durban is home to us and we are very comfortable here. We never expected that such a thing would transpire. That is why I think it has come as a very rude shock. This is the first time India House has been intruded like this,"" Vikram was quoted as saying by Independent Online.""They took my youngest son hostage and also beat up my staff and they showed their guns to my wife,"" he said. ""We are still trying to come to terms about what has happened,"" he said further as he expressed hope that Indian diplomats and India House would be provided adequate security.In Video: On cam: Indian diplomat's residence in Durban robbed, son held hostage"

So when the team of doctors visited us, we held them hostage until senior health authorities came here and listened to our grievances.”The team of doctors remained were released only after the additional chief medical officer reached the village and pacified the locals.Situated 20 km away from Meerut, Kastla village has a total population of 5,000 and villagers say there is hardly any house which does not have a dengue patient. A family of 25 persons drawn from three generations claimed that everybody in their house was suffering from dengue.The village head, Gajendra Nagar, said, “I was myself admitted to a private hospital when I had dengue. At least 50 people have died here due to dengue in the last two months and over 400 persons are suffering from the disease. But not even a single health official visited us.”Additional chief medical officer Sanjay Jodha, who rushed to the village to procure the release of doctors, told TOI, “We inspected the village hospital which was found to be deplorable. I have transferred the medical officer and suspended the pharmacist for being absent from his work for a long time.

Even those two are not confirmed.”Chief medical officer Ramesh Chandra said, “An inquiry has been set up to find out the truth. If any such death is confirmed, necessary action will be taken against the concerned authorities.”"

WASHINGTON: The Trump administration has dramatically ramped up drone strikes on Pakistan in the past week after the rescue of a Canadian-American couple and their three children, purportedly with Islamabad’s help. High-intensity and frequent strikes -- of the kind not seen since 2010, when they averaged two a week -- have resumed, amid signs that things are not all hunky-dory between the two countries despite both sides talking nice on the rescue issue.Half a dozen drone strikes have rained missiles in Pakistan’s Kurram Agency following the rather shady “rescue” of the Canadian-American couple by the Pakistani military, which initially claimed that they were freed after a firefight with Taliban when they were being transported across the Pak-Afghan border. The “rescue” was reportedly based on US intelligence inputs, resulting in the interception of the vehicle on the Pakistani side of the border, and culminating in a clash in which all the hostage-takers were conveniently either reported killed or escaped.But the Trump administration embarrassed Islamabad by publicly calling out Pakistan’s lies, with both Vice President Mike Pence and CIA Director Mike Pompeo saying the couple (and their three children) was being held in Pakistan, and not Afghanistan. “The Vice President thanked (Pakistan’s Prime Minister) Abbasi for his government's assistance in recovering US and Canadian hostages that were being held captive by the Haqqani Taliban Network in the tribal areas of Pakistan,” a White House readout of Pence’s call to the Pakistani leader said.There was no mention of Afghanistan or their crossing the border into Pakistan, and CIA director Mike Pompeo, too, confirmed the hostages were being held inside Pakistan, while demanding that Pakistan deny safe havens to the Taliban.There was also an ominous note in the Pence readout. “Vice President Pence noted this effort as an important development in Pakistan's support to the US strategy against terrorism in the region, but highlighted that cooperation against militant groups must be continued and sustained,” it said. “Just as he did during the meeting the two had in New York last month, the Vice President again discussed ways that Pakistan could work with the United States and others to bolster stability and security for all in South Asia.”The US media had expressed skepticism about the rescue story dished out by the Pakistani military, given its long and close ties with the Haqqani network, which is alleged to have kept the Canadian-American couple hostage for more than five years. One explanation for their “rescue” soon after the return from U.S of Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Khwaja Asif was the ultimate he received in Washington, following up on the blunt warning issued by the President and his senior advisors that the time had come for punitive action against Islamabad.A panicked Pakistani establishment appears to have decided not to push its luck while engineering the “rescue” of the hostages, including three infant and toddler children, much to the delight of a Trump administration that has had little success to boast of. Trump then publicly thanked tweeting: “Starting to develop a much better relationship with Pakistan and its leaders. I want to thank them for their cooperation on many fronts.”The tweet sent alarms among regional experts, most of them deeply skeptical of Pakistan’s anti-terrorism credentials, with questions of how little it would take for the U.S President to over-turn a new Afghan policy that has been arrived at after much deliberation.But in the week since the rescue, Pakistan has been battered by Drone strikes, even as its foreign minister Khwaja Asif has maintained that the strikes are in indeterminate territory since the borders with Afghanistan are poorly demarcated in the Kurram region.These are the first drone strikes by the Trump administration after such attacks by unmanned aircraft reached a peak in 2010 (122 strikes) under the Obama administration and gradually petered out with 70 (in 2011), 48 (2012), 26 (2013), 22 (2014), 10 (2015) and 3 (2016).The sudden resumption this past week with six strikes comes after both President Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned Pakistan that it is best to end its support for terrorist groups in its own interest. Tillerson is scheduled to drop by in Islamabad later this month before visiting New Delhi."

WASHINGTON: CIA chief Mike Pompeo has said a US-Canadian couple kidnapped by terrorists in Afghanistan had been held for five years inside Pakistan before being freed, contradicting the Pakistan Army's claim that the hostages were rescued shortly after entering the country from Afghanistan.""The couple had been held for five years inside Pakistan,"" Pompeo yesterday said during a wide-ranging discussion at the Foundation for Defence of Democracies, a Washington-based thinktank.His remarks contradicts the Pakistan Army which had said in a statement that the hostages ""were captured by terrorists from Afghanistan during 2012 and kept as hostages there.""Caitlan Coleman, an American citizen, and her husband Joshua Boyle , a Canadian citizen, were kidnapped in 2012 in Afghanistan while on a backpacking trip.Coleman, 31, was pregnant at the time of abduction. All of the couple's three children were born in captivity.The Pakistan Army statement issued on October 12 did not identify the group which had held the family captive, but the US leadership have blamed Haqqani Network as the perpetrators.After the recovery of hostages, the Pakistan military officials emphasised the importance of co-operation and intelligence sharing by Washington.""The success underscores the importance of timely intelligence sharing and Pakistan's continued commitment towards fighting this menace through cooperation between two forces against a common enemy,"" the Army statement said.The operation came at a time when Pakistan is trying to rebuild bilateral ties frayed after President Donald Trump accused the country of sheltering terror groups.Trump, in August, had accused Pakistan of harbouring ""agents of chaos and terror"" and the ""very enemy US forces have fighting in Afghanistan"" for the past 17 years.Last week, Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif had said his country was ready for a joint operation with the US to destroy the Haqqani Network if it provides evidence about the presence of safe havens of the dreaded terror outfit in Pakistan.The Haqqani network has carried out a number of kidnappings and attacks against US interests in Afghanistan. The group is also blamed for several deadly attacks against Indian interests in Afghanistan, including the 2008 bombing of the Indian mission in Kabul that killed 58 people.US officials believe Pakistan's spy agency ISI maintains close ties with the Haqqani Network and provides safe havens to its top leadership.""I think history would indicate that the high expectations for the Pakistanis' willingness to help us in the fight against radical Islamic terrorism should be set at a very low level,"" the CIA chief said.President Trump has ""made it very clear that we are going to do everything we can to bring the Taliban to the negotiation table. To do that, you cannot have a safe haven in Pakistan. The intelligence is very clear,"" he warned.Pompeo said ""to achieve the objective that the president has set forth in Afghanistan, the capacity of terrorists to cross along the Afghan border and freely hide in Pakistan is prohibited in our capacity to deliver that and so mission is to ensure that safe haven does not exist""."

WASHINGTON: US President Barack Obama has appointed a diplomat to the newly created post of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs which will analyse and find effective remedies to hostage issues. Jim O'Brien , a seasoned diplomat, was appointed as the First Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs after government's comprehensive hostage policy review which was completed earlier this summer.""That review recognised the need for fully coordinated action across US agencies in responding to hostage situations and to the military, diplomatic, legal, and humanitarian issues that such situations generate,"" Secretary of State John Kerry said.Kerry said that O'Brien is exactly the right person for a job that demands a high level of diplomatic experience and the ability to analyse and find effective remedies to complex problems.""In his new position, Jim will be focused on one over riding goal: using diplomacy to secure the safe return of Americans held hostage overseas,"" Kerry added.To that end, he will be in close contact with the families of American hostages, meet with foreign leaders in support of our hostage recovery efforts, advise on options to enhance those efforts, participate in strategy meetings with other senior US policymakers, and represent the US internationally on hostage-related issues.The new Special Presidential Envoy will work closely with the inter agency Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell that was also created as a result of the hostage policy review.O'Brien is currently vice chair of the Albright Stonebridge Group, a global strategy and business advisory firm.Previously, he served as Special Presidential Envoy for the Balkans in the late 1990s, helping to chart a path out of the military and political strife that divided the region.He also served as Deputy Director of the State Department's Office of Policy Planning and as a senior adviser to UN Ambassador and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.He helped to formulate the 1995 Dayton Accords, which ended the war in Bosnia; and guided US support for the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, which helped bring to justice persons responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity."

A husband-wife's day long scuffle took violent proportions when the man held a knife to his daughter's throat as a threatening gesture .The girls, who sustained minor injuries , were immediately rushed to the hospital. Their mother took the matter in her own hands and filed a complaint against her husband at the MIDC Bhosari police station on Friday.On February 17, Vijay Vayal (33) and his wife, Sheetal (28) entered into a spat, which the neighbours informed were occurring quite regularly and over different issues. On Friday afternoon, the couple's argument left a bitter Vijay writhing in anger for the entire day.Around 8.30 pm, he threatened to slit his daughters' throats before Sheetal, in a bid to tell her that “she cannot have her way in a dispute“.The yelling continued for a while, where he reportedly asked her to mend her ways.Sheetal and Vijay have been married for seven years now. What seemed to be a blissful marriage initially, turned sour over half a decade. The couple, who resides in Indrayni Nagar, Bhosari, owns a laundromat business.Their first daughter, Sharvari, was born a year after a marriage. Five years later, Sheetal gave birth to their second daughter, Sai.Over the span of time, the neighbours said that the marriage was falling apart. When the cops questioned them, they were told that Sheetal and Vijay would end up having a big quarrel every month over impending money issues or differences over minor things.However, they added that the attempt to injure the girls had occurred for the first time. The Vayal family claimed that Vijay loved his daughters.The cops reached the spot as soon as the complaint was registered. “We arrested Vijay from his home. Currently, he seems to be in a state of shock for holding a knife against his daughters' throat. He will be in the police custody for next four days,“ said Hemant Kokni, police sub-inspector of MIDC Bhosari.He added that Vijay's family has told the Bhosari police (and the act itself is proof enough, feel cops), that there is a possibility that he did this in a fit of rage. “We have been told that he has had temperamental issues for a while now,“ Kokani said.Vijay has been charged for attempt to murder and intent to provoke breach of the peace under sections 307 and 504 of the Indian Penal Code. Sharvari and Sai are currently recovering and will get discharged from the hospital soon."

The landlords usually pay in the shape of paddy and cash also. But this time because of cash crunch , they were paid only the paddy for the labour they lent.Kasibahal is one of the largest panchayats having 98 per cent people dependent on farming. The panchayat comes under Koksara block, where there are three ATMs including the one of SBI. The Kasibahal village is about 20 km from the block headquarters, where there is one ATM.""Since the big landlords for whom the marginal farmers work don’t have enough cash as the ATMs are not able to meet the requirement. Otherwise, the villagers would have some cash at least for buying essential item like kerosene,"" Mundary told TOI.He said the panchayat doesn’t provide kerosene in lieu of paddy. “We have never given kerosene by taking anything in kind. This is against the rule,"" said the BDO adding he has discussed with Primary Agricultural Credit Society (Pacs), which buys paddy from the farmers on minimum support price (MSP) fixed by the government. But, the villagers, who held the sarpanch hostage , are not registered as to sell their paddy in Pacs’ mandi."

NEW DELHI: A day before the start of the monsoon session of Parliament, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi launched a scathing attack on the Modi government, saying the country could not be hostage to those “who wish to impose upon it a narrow-minded, divisive and communal vision"". Addressing a meeting of MPs from several opposition parties on the eve of the presidential poll , Sonia said the election represented “a conflict of disparate values” and the battle should be fought hard.Admitting that the ruling BJP-led alliance had an edge in the presidential and vice-presidential poll, Sonia appealed for a conscience vote. “In these contests, the numbers may be against us. But the battle must be fought and fought hard. We cannot and must not let India be hostage to those who wish to impose upon it a narrow-minded, divisive and communal vision,” she said.“This election represents a clash of ideas, a conflict of disparate values. The election demands a vote of conscience to preserve the India that the Mahatma and that illustrious generation of freedom fighters, joined by thousands upon thousands of ordinary men and women, fought for,” she added. The opposition’s presidential candidate Meira Kumar and vice-presidential candidate Gopalkrishna Gandhi were present at the meeting.JD(U), which supports the NDA candidate for the presidential poll, was not present. The vice-presidential poll will be on August 5. Both elections take place through secret ballot and electors are not bound by any whip.“Our meeting marks not only our coming together to protect and preserve our pluralistic democracy, but also our shared vision for our nation.What is at stake is our future, and the values we cherish and must uphold especially at this time of grave disquiet.” Stressing that parliamentarians must have confidence in the values they believe in, she said, “We must stand more aware than ever of who we are, what we fought for in our Independence struggle and what future we want for ourselves.“The presence of so many of you from so many different parties to support our distinguished candidates confirms that the fight for an inclusive, tolerant and pluralistic India is being truly waged. It is a fight we will never give up.”In Video: Prez poll a fight against narrow-minded communal vision: Sonia Gandhi"

When she opened the door, she found two persons who introduced themselves as cops from Ladowal police station.The complainant said since there was a case against her husband at Ladowal police station, she allowed them inside. They asked for a glass of water, and while she was going towards the kitchen, the duo pounced on her and threw a rope around her neck, due to which she fell down.One of them pointed a pistol at her head and asked her to sit down with her face towards the wall. He also held a big knife in another hand and brushed it against her neck. His accomplice in the meantime, broke the locks of almirahs in three rooms and store and collected gold jewellery weighing around 15 tolas and worth Rs1.5 lakhs.The complainant said one of them even asked his accomplice to kill her, but she somehow managed to save her life by giving them two gold bangles and earrings, while begging for her life. The accused then fled after locking her inside a room. Police said it was later when Bhupinder Singh — nephew of Dharam Singh came to meet her uncle for some work that he found his aunt locked in the house.He informed his uncle, following which a complaint was lodged with the Ladowal police station. Gurdev Kaur said there was jewellery in the house as the marriage of her son Karamvir Singh Saini, who runs a garment store in the area, was scheduled after ten days, and the family was on a shopping spree.SHO Ravinderpal Singh said cops had got CCTV footage of the area, and were scanning it.

An Indian Catholic priest missing since a suspected Islamic State (IS) attack last Friday on a care home in Aden, Yemen, is reportedly being held captive by the assailants. An Indian nun was among 16 people killed in the strike on the Missionaries of Charityrun establishment, while another is reportedly missing.External affairs minister Sushma Swaraj announced on Saturday that Father Tom Uzhunnalil, a native of Kottayam who lived at the home, had been abducted. He had arrived there from an unsafe place in Yemen for refuge.“Our camp office in (Yemen’s neighbour) Djibouti is trying to ascertain the whereabouts of Father Tom Uzhunnalil so that we can secure his release,” Swaraj added in a Twitter post. India shut down its mission in Yemen after evacuating most of its citizens last year.According to local reports, the 56-year-old priest was handcuffed before being driven away to an undisclosed destination. Kerala CM Oommen Chandy said there were no clues about Uzhunnalil’s whereabouts. “She (Swaraj) expressed doubts about the efficacy of the government there, but has assured that the Centre will do its best,” he added. Chandy was also quoted as saying that Swaraj had mentioned an Indian nurse being missing since the attack.Yemeni authorities have blamed IS for the attack. “We are aware that no group has claimed the attack... but information points to... Daesh (an Arabic acronym for IS),” said a security official."

HARIDWAR: Swami Ramanand Puri, a prominent seer from Haridwar who went missing a couple of months ago and resurfaced some days ago, has alleged that he was “kidnapped and held hostage by his own people.”Alleging that there is a threat to his life, the seer met senior police officials in Dehradun on Sunday and requested that security be provided to him since he feared for his life. Puri was head of the Mansa DeviTemple Trust which administers the famous Mansa Devi temple in Haridwar. However, sometime back, another seer Ravindra Puri , a mahant of the Niranjani akhara took over the chairmanship of the trust as well as the control of Ramanand Institute of Management and Pharmacy which had been set up by RamanandPuri.In a press conference in Dehradun, Ramanand alleged that Ravindra Puri had kept him as a hostage and forcibly occupied the posts to gain control of the properties of the trust and the institute. “The total worth of the properties of the institute and the temple trust is around Rs100 crore, for which the conspiracy against me has been hatched,” he alleged.Providing details of his ‘captivity’, the seer alleged that he was kept confined in his ashram by RavindraPuri from September last year onwards. “In November, I was shifted to an ashram in Allahabad and my mobile phones were taken away and I was not allowed to interact with anyone,” he said. He added that “in March this year, one of my disciples, Surendra Kumar (who is the MLA of Manda in Allahabad) somehow managed to take me out of the ashram and bring me to Delhi.” “It was in Delhi that I learnt I had been removed from the posts I held at the ashram, trust and institute on the basis of my forged letters of resignation.”After Ramanand Puri’s allegations, a few other ascetics came out in his support. “Ravindra Puri has not acted alone in hatching the conspiracy against Ramanand. He has acted in connivance with the Akhil BharatiyaAkhara Parishad in this matter,” said Brahmarishi Kush Muni, an ascetic from Allahabad.TOI made several attempts to reach Ravindra Puri for his comments but he remained unavailable."

However, the agitating tribals and dalits alleged that the police officials were harassing them in the name of the theft of wood, though three of their colony members were arrested in the case.The colony members including women and children first blocked the vehicle of the forest officials in the mroning, and encircled the officials when they stepped out the of the vehicle. The forest officials said the colony members did not cause any hurt to them. The agitating group released the forest officials i n the afternoon after the police officials from Peechi station held talks with their leaders and the forest officials.According the DFO George Mathew, the forest officials had received complaints saying that some trees in the compounds of the residents in the colony, forming part of the forest areas were cut and removed. He said it was not clear how many trees were cut, but the visit was to collect such details.However the Vasu , leader of the agitating tribals and dalits clarified that they were not opposed to any investigations and booking of the accused involved in the wood theft. ""We want those culpable must be punished. In fact we ourselves had spotted three people in our colony and the police had arrested them. We had cooperated with the forest officials when they came to the colony on seven occasions earlier for investigation. Now they are coming repeatedly to harass us, and want to lay the blame on us for all the illegal activities happening here’’ he said.``Everyone knows that transporting of wood from the forest areas cannot happen without the connivance of the forest officials. So we have told them further raids can be conducted by the forest officials only if the police are accompanying them,’’ Vasu said. The DFO denied the charges that the forest officials are harassing the residents in the colonies. ``We are just searching in their compounds to locate whether any evidences like remains of wood trunks are there in the compounds. We are not even entering their houses,’’ he said. The DFO said the forest officials would go to the colonies along with the police."

GURUGRAM: More than a week after two men kidnapped an insurance executive at gunpoint on Sohna Road and robbed him of Rs 1,95,000, the accused were arrested in Iffco Chowk on Friday night.The 32-year-old employee of AIG Insurance, Samarth Kohli, was rescued by police on May 23 from Pali in Rajasthan, a day after the abduction, as cops tracked the location of the ATMs where robbers forced Samarth to withdraw money. The accused were produced in a city court on Saturday and have been sent on a three-day police remand.Identified as Rahul Yadav and Jitender Joshi, the two men have also been involved in cricket betting and gambling over the last few months, said police. While Jitender is a school dropout, Rahul pursued BEd after finishing his graduation; however, both of them are unemployed.On May 22, Samarth was held hostage by the accused when he stopped his Honda City on Sohna Road around 10pm. Police said the robber-duo had lost a lot of money in gambling, and they were planning a heist to pay off the debts. The duo got into an argument with Samarth on the pretext of getting injured by the old car lights that Samarth dumped after halting the car. He was then thrashed, kidnapped at gunpoint and forced to withdraw money from his different ATM cards during the 15-hour ordeal.“They not only thrashed him but continued to use his ATM cards for withdrawal of cash,” said Deepak Saharan, DCP (east) told TOI.After Samarth was kidnapped, his brother, Dhruv, informed the police about the SMSes of ATM transactions on the mobile that he had left back at home.While several transactions were carried out in Gurgaon from ATMs in Sector 14 and Sector 49, an SMS gave details about payment of Rs 2,360 made at a petrol pump in Rewari. Police confirmed that Samarth had been kidnapped by recovering CCTV footage from the petrol pump. Samarth was rescued 15 hours later from Pali in Rajasthan, about 500km from Gurgaon, where the accused left him and fled.The case, registered at Sadar police station under section 365 (kidnap) of the IPC, was handed over to crime unit, Palam Vihar. On Friday night, the crime unit team headed by inspector Sajjan Singh Dalal finally nabbed the duo after receiving a tip-off.Police said most of the amount has been recovered; however, the weapon which was used to threaten and kidnap Samarth has not been found yet."

KOLKATA: Three employees of an NGO were held captive at a local club in Tollygunge till late into Friday by family members of an 18-year-old boy who had gone with the NGO to attend a training programme at Delhi but had died after he had allegedly opened the door of an air conditioned compartment of Rajdhani Express and fell off the train The death took place on Tuesday morning, while the train was travelling Past Etawah in Uttar Pradesh around 7.30am. According to a senior official of the NGO - Kolkata Hope Foundation - Roshan Kumar Singh, had complained of feeling suffocated and opened the door to have some fresh air, when he lost balance and fell on the tracks. Roshan was a first year student of South City College who had got 91 percent marks in Higher Secondary this year.The NGO official informed his family over phone about his death and after post mortem examination was done, his body was brought back to Kolkata in a coffin and handed over to his parents on Wednesday. His funeral was completed the same night. On Friday, the NGO officials had gone there to get some signature on documents that the Government Railway Police at Uttar Pradesh had asked the NGO to get done by the boy's parents when they held them captive.Police had tried to rescue them and although they succeeded in rescuing a woman, two others -- a middle aged woman and a man in his late 30 were still held captive inside a local club as local residents of Chandra Mondal Lane in Mudiali agitated before the police demanding a thorough explanation of how the boy died and demanded arrest of the NGO director.""An accident case has been initiated by the GRP at Uttar Pradesh. Our employees were not at fault. The boy had fell down by himself. It is a tragic incident to which several other train passengers are witness to,"" said Geeta Venkadakrishnan, the NGO director.The boy's mother, Devanti Devi Singh however refused to believe it was just an accident. ""The NGO authorities never took our permission before taking my son to Delhi. They did not explain how he died and left his dead body in a coffin outside our house and had left. I think my son was either killed or he died because of their negligence. A thorough investigation in this case should be done,"" she said.The NGO, Kolkata Hope Foundation runs a free coaching institute for slum dwellers at the Tollygunge Police Station under the project Nabadisha. According to the NGO authorities, Roshan used to take coaching here from a very early age and was one of the brighter students. ""So he was selected for the training.

GURUGRAM: A 32-year-old insurance executive from Delhi was kidnapped by two armed men in Gurugram on Monday night and held hostage in his car overnight as he was driven from one ATM to another to withdraw as much cash as possible before being rescued by police from Rajgarh in Rajasthan , nearly 200km away, on Tuesday afternoon.Samarth Kohli’s 15-hour ordeal began at Subhash Chowk late on Monday when he was driving home to Tilak Nagar in Delhi. Kohli, an employee of AIG Insurance whose office is in Sector 48, had stopped around 10pm near Subhash Chowk to throw out old car headlights, which he had recently got replaced, from the boot of his silver-coloured Honda City, when two men with guns appeared and held him hostage. They forced him to lie down between the front and back rows of his car, and drove off, Kohli told police.The abductors stopped at various locations, forced Kohli to provide pin numbers of his three ATM cards, and made several withdrawals from his accounts. Luckily, the withdrawal SMS alerts were being sent to a number being used by Kohli’s sister-in-law, which the kidnappers were unaware of.On Monday morning, Samarth’s brother Dhruv filed a complaint at Sadar police station, about his brother not returning home, while multiple withdrawals were being made from his account, including a credit card payment at a petrol pump in Sector 14. Dhruv also said there were three withdrawals of Rs 10,000 each, and one of Rs 5,000 from an ATM in Universal Tower. One more withdrawal was made at Jaipur, raising suspicion Kohli had been abducted.A case was registered under Section 365 (kidnapping) of IPC. Police soon confirmed the abduction by checking CCTV footage from the petrol pump. A police team was immediately dispatched to Rajasthan. “We narrowed down their route with the help of locations of ATMs they withdrew from, which indicated they were moving along the Jaipur-Ajmer highway. We immediately got in touch with the Jaipur IG and the Ajmer SP, and had barricades set up along the route,” said ACP (Sadar) Anil Yadav, who headed the rescue operation.At around 8am, the kidnappers got Kohli to call his family to inform them he was safe. By this time, they had withdrawn around Rs 1.5 lakh from Kohli’s account. The kidnappers went past a few barricades near Beawar on the highway, but were finally signalled to stop near Rajgarh in Rajasthan around 1pm. The kidnappers drove through the barricade, stopped meters ahead and ran away on foot, leaving Kohli and the car.“We have some strong leads on the kidnappers, who have been identified. One of them is from Rajasthan, the other from Haryana,” added Yadav..(With inputs from Sanjay Yadav)"

Greater Noida: Three officials of Noida Power Company Limited ( NPCL ) were allegedly held hostage for over four hours by villagers of Luksar village in Echotech 1, Greater Noida, on Thursday.NPCL officials had on Thursday morning held a camp for the collection of dues in the village as part of an ongoing drive.While the villagers claimed the charges levied on them were arbitrary, the NPCL officials claimed that some villagers were indulging in power theft . The villagers have threatened to stage a sit-in outside the NPCL office in Greater Noida in the coming days if their grivances were not heard.Sandeep Kumar, a resident, said he had shut down the meter at his residence before moving out of town on July 29, 2016, and even handed over the meter to NPCL, and yet the family has been billed the fixed charge of Rs 288 and user charge of Rs 1,307 every month since then.“We don’t understand how we are being charged when there is no meter in our house,” Kumar said.Similarly, another resident., Rajpal Singh, had shut down and surrendered his meter 10 years ago when he sold his house and shifted to another place. He is still being billed a pending amount of Rs 4,000.Agitated over the lack of a response from NPCL, some residents of the village held the three NPCL officials hostage from 10am to 2.30pm. According to the villagers, the village is only getting about six hours of power supply at night. However, Sarnath Ganguly, general manager (Operations), NPCL, told TOI that when Rajesh Mishra, NPCL assistant manager, went to Luksar village with two junior staff members to hold a camp for dues collection many cases of power theft came to light.“Four-five residents lost their cool in the heat of the moment and detained the officials. As a result, the dues collection camp’s mission failed,” Ganguly said, adding that it was not true that power was supplied to the village only for six hours. “We are supplying power for 14 hours to the village and neighbouring areas,” Ganguly said."

KOLKATA: From Kidderpore to Raigunj, the campus scene looks like an action-packed crime thriller. For elite institutions like Presidency University and Jadavpur University , it is liberty unlimited. Caught between extremes, the silent majority of the students do not know what to do.Bengal has witnessed many upheavals in educational institutions since the Naxal days. The context and issues may have changed, with the recent ones failing to establish a social connect, but the vacuum has encouraged the ruling party and the libertines to act as they wish.Parents are getting jittery and so are sections of students. But this voice of silence is going unheard in the power game. Like realtors breaking up the city into syndicate zones, the ruling politicians are concentrating on college campuses to establish party hegemony. This belies what Mamata Banerjee had promised before coming to power.The Mamata government decimated the erstwhile college governing bodies, senates, syndicates and executive councils -the democratic structures in education institutions - claiming they had become wings of the Left Front to exercise control. What it did instead was pack the units with their own men and plugged the scope of representation of university stake holders. The government also made amends to the process to select the vice-chancellor by dropping the UGC nominee from the selection panel. The result is clear. Vice-chancellors and principals now love to be seen on the dais with the chief ministers. The VC has become all-powerful and there is little space for dialogue. Such a system has bred misgivings, mistrust and lack of patience among students, often with ugly manifestations.This atmosphere is impeding education reforms that Bengal needs. A case in point is former education minister Bratya Basu's failed effort to introduce a centralized online admission system. The local satraps didn't like this transparency because it could end the admission syndicates in many colleges. The corruption is inherent to a party command system where loyalty gets precedence over merit. It has roots in the Left Front regime. Young Trinamool leaders took this further and monetized it.Those who got admission on their own either withdrew themselves from the social sphere, or joined the chorus to buy peace.Few enjoying the immunity of elite institutions raised their voice, often to prove they were different from the rest. They started abusing the system and disrespecting individuals as if that was enough to show their dissent. In the process, they misused democracy, defamed institutions and in a way are helping those who want to run education institutions like sweatshops."

Thrissur: A group of people belonging to the SC/ST colony at Thamaravellachal near Peechi held eight forest officials, including the DFO hostage for about four hours on Tuesday.The officials claimed they had gone to the colony as part of the investigation on the theft of wood from forest areas.However, the agitating tribesmen and dalits alleged that the officials were harassing them in the name of theft of wood, though three of their colony members have been arrested in the case.The agitators released the officials by afternoon after the police officials from Peechi station held talks with their leaders.According the DFO George Mathew, the forest officials had received complaints saying that some trees in the compounds of the residents in the colony, which come under forest area, were cut down.However Vasu, leader of the agitating tribesmen and dalits clarified that they were not opposed to any investigation and action against accused involved in the wood theft.""We want those responsible for cutting trees to be punished. Everyone knows that transporting of wood from the forest area cannot happen without the connivance of the forest officials. So we have told them further raids can be conducted by the forest officials only if the police accompany them,'' he said. The DFO denied the charges that the officials harassed the residents ."

LONDON: Islamic State terrorists have released a horrific new video that shows five boys, including one said to be from the UK, aged between 10 to 13 years shooting prisoners in Syria.The boys are seen shooting dead five men identified as captured Kurdish fighters who are kneeling.A caption claims the white boy in the video is Abu Abdullah al-Britani, who is allegedly British.All the boys are pictured in full military fatigues and a black hat alongside the four other boys.Five hostages are shown dressed in familiar orange jumpsuits seen in previous ISIS propaganda videos, 'The Times' reports.""No one can save the Kurds even with the support of America, France, Britain, Germany, the devils in hell,"" the British boy is heard to say in Arabic.He then calls for the 'takbir' -- the term referring to the phrase 'Allahu akbar' -- which the other boys shout in unison, raising their pistols to the sky before shooting the hostages dead.The video then pans to gunshot wounds to the men's heads as they lie dead in the sand.The four other boys in the footage are captioned as being Tunisian, Kurdish, Egyptian and Uzbekistani in origin.There is no confirmation of the identity of the British boy from the UK Foreign Office but it is believed he could be the son of a white-British woman convert and was taken to join ISIS at the age of 10.The name Abu Abdullah al-Britani may refer to his adopted father - a young British terrorist who married in Syria and was killed in a drone strike.Children have featured prominently in ISIS propaganda in which the militant group boasts about preparing the next generation of fighters."

ISLAMABAD/NEW DELHI: Pakistan on Sunday rejected reports that an Indian woman married to a Pakistani man was being held hostage at the Indian High Commission building in Islamabad Tahir Ali, a resident of Buner town in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in the northwest, had lodged a complaint at Islamabad’s Secretariat police station to help him recover his Indian national wife, Uzma, who had gone into the Indian embassy but did not return.Local media, however, said that foreign office spokesperson Nafees Zakaria had rubbished reports that the woman was being held hostage inside the Indian High Commission building.Ali had met Uzma in Malaysia eight months ago where he was working as a taxi driver. Police said Uzma came to Pakistan on May 1 via Wagah border and the two contracted a court marriage two days later in Buner.Later, Uzma called her brother in New Delhi and informed him that she had tied the knot. According to Ali, her brother asked her to visit India on honeymoon and told her that to contact a person named Adnan at the Indian embassy who would sort out their visas issue for the trip.In his complaint to the police, Ali alleged: “At the Indian embassy window she asked for Adnan. A while later, a man came out and took her inside through gate number six. I waited and waited, and then at 7pm, I asked the embassy staff at the gate if my wife was inside. They told me no one was inside.”“I then returned to the main gate on a shuttle bus,” he said, adding that none of the three phones surrendered to the embassy by them at the time of entrance were returned to him.When police contacted the Indian High Commission, the officials there said Uzma was in their office but refused to release her, saying that negotiations on the matter will be held through the foreign office. The foreign office said it was in contact with the Indian High Commission and the issue would be resolved soon.An Indian government source said the woman had sought help from the Indian mission on May 5. “The high commission is providing necessary consular assistance to the woman and is in touch with the Pakistan foreign office and her family in India,” he said."

LUCKNOW: A cancer patient held hostage by a private hospital on Kursi Road was rescued by a health team on Friday evening. The authorities also found that the private hospital was running without any documents and extending services in general surgery and gynaecology besides cancer care.The relative of another patient anonymously complained to chief medical officer Dr GS Bajpai that the hospital authorities had held a patient hostage as the latter was not able to pay treatment bills.“We got the complaint late evening and acted immediately,“ said Dr Bajpai.“We found seven patients admitted but no doctor present. Even nurses and paramedics ran away in a jiffy on seeing us,“ the CMO said. Initially, the team did not find any patient held hostage.Seeing a few rooms locked, the team decided to break open into them. “We were shocked to see a middle-aged woman locked in a semi-conscious state in a room. When she gained conscious, she revealed that she was suffering from cancer and her relatives had gone to arrange for money to pay bills,“ Dr Bajpai said, adding that the woman has been admitted to KGMU.The team examined patient files and seized all documents present. “The premises have been sealed under law.An FIR has been lodged against the owner and manager,“ the CMO said.Patients who appeared serious were shifted to KGMU, Avanti Bai hospital and RML hospital.The team comprised Dr Rajendra Chaudhury, Dr SK Rawat, Dr PK Mishra and staff Saurabh. An additional city magistrate-rank officer and local police accompanied the team. A high court order empowers the CMO to raid any medical establishment working in an unauthorized manner."

The crew ""was released in an inter-tribe exchange on the Pakistan-Afghan border (and) arrived in Islamabad today"", foreign ministry spokesman Nafees Zakaria said. Some security analysts believe the exchange could be a result of the influence of ISI on the terrorists."

GURGAON: A teenage girl was lured by two of her acquaintances to Delhi, held hostage for over two days, repeatedly gang-raped and videographed during the act, before being released on Monday. An FIR was filed on Monday after the rape survivor approached police along with her parents, but no one has been arrested so far.According to the police complaint, on Saturday afternoon, the 15-year-old girl, a student of Class X in a government school in Badshapur, was lured out of her school by her acquaintance Karan Singh, a resident of Palra village. Singh convinced her to accompany him to Delhi on a private bus plying from Sohna to Delhi, along with the other accused, Sanjay, an unemployed youth from Dhani Shikohpur village. Once they reached Kalkaji in Delhi, she was held hostage in a room where the duo raped her.The next day, they raped her again, while two others, Mahesh and Kala, both residents of Palra, allegedly made an objectionable video to be used to blackmail her. In her complaint, the girl had initially named Mahesh as the videographer. She later changed her version while submitting the recorded statement before a magistrate under CrPC Section 164, including Kala as Mahesh's assistant in making the video.After two days in captivity, the accused allegedly put her in a Gurgaon-bound bus on Monday morning and sent her back to her parents. She broke down and told them everything, and was taken to the police station. Based on her complaint, a medical examination was conducted, which confirmed rape. Police subsequently registered an FIR against the three, under sections 363 (abduction), 365 (abducting with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine person), 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC and Section 6 of POCSO Act.""She was taken to Delhi by Karan Singh and his friend Sanjay on Saturday by a bus. After raping her for two days and making a video of it, the accused allegedly threatened to kill her if she disclosed anything to anyone. Karan was known to the girl, which is why she trusted him, under the impression they would return to Gurgaon in two hours,"" police said the survivor had told them.""Based on the complaint, an FIR has been registered against three persons. A fourth has now been added for criminal conspiracy. All four are aged between 23 and 25, and are unemployed. We're probing the matter. They are at large, but we are conducting raids and hope to nab them soon,"" said Praveen Malik, SHO, Badshapur."

AGRA: Agitated anganwadi workers on Tuesday took SDM and ADM of Mainpuri hostage, locking them inside their room for almost half an hour, to protest against the administration's failure in taking action on their demand of higher remuneration.According to Sarita Shakya, vice-president of UP Aganwadi Association, they had been agitating for their demands for the last one month but no one from the administration was paying heed to them. She said they tried to serve a memorandum on the officials on Tuesday and when they refused to accept it, they locked the SDM and the ADM in their offices.“It was only after the administration gave us a written assurance and fixed our meeting in Lucknow that we allowed the ADM and the SDM to come out”, she said adding that they were also demanding action against a DPO who had threatened to sack a colleague, who subsequently died due to a hear attack.She said the association’s demands include increase of their honorary payment from existing Rs 3,200 to Rs 15,000.When contacted, district magistrate PC Gupta denied that the ADM and SDM were kept hostage. “They just locked their back room for a short while”, he said adding that a meeting of the angawadi workers has been fixed with the department’s director and secretary for resolving their demands."

NEW DELHI: An elderly woman, her granddaughter and their maid were held hostage at knifepoint in their house in west Delhi’s Kirti Nagar on Monday afternoon by their cook and two other men and robbed of Rs 40 lakh in cash and jewellery.The cook was hired three days ago.The incident took place between 1pm and 3pm when the woman, Tajender Kaur (60), was at home with her 11-month-old granddaughter and a maid. Kaur’s son and his wife were away at work and her husband, Swarn Singh, had gone to his factory in Kondli.“The cook arrived at the house around 1pm. After about 15 minutes, two other men entered the house with his help and straightaway went to the elderly woman’s room. They tied her arms with a piece of cloth and locked her in a room. The three men then locked the maid and the infant in another room,” said a senior police officer.The robbers snatched the cellphones of the victims to stop them from calling for help.The three men then ransacked the house and fled with cash and jewellery. Kaur somehow managed to free herself. She then unlocked the room that had the maid and the baby and untied the hands of the maid.“Kaur called up her husband and son who informed the police. A crime and forensics team was sent to the house to collect samples. CCTV footage near the house is being checked to establish the sequence of events and identify the other robbers,” the officer said.DCP (west) Pushpendra Kumar said that a case has been registered on the victim’s statement.“Probe has revealed that the cook, Vinod, is a native of Gonda in Uttar Pradesh. Teams have been formed to raid his hideouts,” he said."

SONARPUR: An upper-middle-class locality in the southern fringes of the city has been inundated for over a fortnight, forcing many to move in with relatives elsewhere. Those who remain, live in perpetual fear as the water level continues to inch up with every bout of heavy shower.Mission Palli, located around 3km from Kamalgazi off the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and not far from Sonarpur rail station, has beautiful bungalows and smart low-rise apartment blocks. Its proximity to the city and an abundance of greenery attracted many to set up residence here. But come monsoon, the dream locality turns nightmarish. The first heavy shower drowns the area and maroons residents for days.The situation has worsened this year, with Mission Palli being under water since July 9-10. It has been nearly three weeks but the water seems far from receding.Prawn exporter Suhas Sarkar, who spent a fortune on a palatial bungalow here, has not been able to step out ever since nightlong rain flooded the locality. As the meteorological office issues another warning of heavy rainfall in south Bengal, Sarkar is contemplating whether to stick on or move out.“I built this house with a lot of passion. It was adjudged the best bungalow in Bengal by Lafarge Cements. But now, I wish I hadn’t invested so much emotion in it. Every time it rains, I peep out of the window, tracking the rise in water level. We can’t breathe fresh air as the windows have to be kept shut to keep the stench of putrefying stagnant water out. I can’t go to my office in Hastings and LIC agents are refusing to collect policy premiums from my residence. The neighbourhood shops are all shut and provision is slowly getting exhausted. I have become a hostage in my own home,” said Sarkar.What is usually a lively locality has sunk into despair. Even in homes that are still occupied, there is no sign of life. With nothing to look at but the sea of still water, residents stay indoors. Only those who have no other option venture out, wading through waist to knee-deep water.Sayantani Gupta, a first year student at Andrews College in Garia, has to wade through the filthy water and then travel an hour to reach college. The first thing she does there is wash her legs vigorously to avoid scabs. “There’s a constant itch till I have a thorough wash. The thought of having to wade through the water again at the end of the day gives me shivers,” she said.Parents of students at Teghoria Primary School spend the afternoons casting anxious glances at the overcast skies. As Srabanti (Class IV) waded through the water with her friend Baisakhi (Class V), her mother prayed for their safe return. If it rains for three-four hours, they will get stranded.Dental surgeon Debasis Maitra hasn’t been able to open his chamber since July 10. With water shutting out the area from the rest of the world, he has no hopes of getting a patient till the water recedes. “I am marooned and helpless. Barring a couple of emergency patients, there’s nothing to do but wait hopelessly,” he said.Hopeless it really is with the municipality and state irrigation department offering no solution to the crisis. About 70% of the 35 wards of Sonarpur-Rajpur Municipality is inundated and some residents were moved into schools in Kamrabad and Chanditala.Municipality chairman Pallab Kumar Das said he tried to find a way out but has failed. “We are trying to pump out water but to no avail. Till it continues to rain, it will not make any difference as there is no drainage line linking the affected localities with Begumpur canal,” he said.Sonarpur MLA Firdousi Begum echoed him, saying, “Three pumps have been installed to drain out the water. But unless the rain stops, the situation is unlikely to change.”Irrigation minister Rajib Banerjee, who toured the inundated localities, including Mission Palli, admitted the situation was critical but had no solution to offer. “Sections of the canal are encroached upon. People have set up homes and shops there. These need to be cleared immediately,” he said.Former state election commissioner Mira Pandey, who lives in Ramkrishna Palli, next to Mission Palli, is bearing the situation with fortitude. But each time she drives through the perpetually waterlogged streets, she wonders how long it is going to be.“I can’t deny the sinking feeling when I return home. People are living in hell,” she said."

Two of them hail from Karad in Satara district while the third one is from Wagholi in the city.""The youths narrated their experiences in captivity. We did not find anything suspicious in their version of the kidnapping,"" said joint police commissioner Sunil Ramanand.Deputy commissioner of police (special branch) Shrikant Pathak questioned the students who were escorted by a policeman from Gadchiroli.The three students - Shrikrishna Shewale, Adarsh Patil and Vikas Walke - had decided to visit the remote areas of Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Telangana as part of their 'Bharat Jodo' campaign. They left Pune on bicycles on December 22, 2015. They were kidnapped while crossing Chintalnar and Sukhma villages, which are Maoist strongholds. The four of them were held captive for four days and released unconditionally on Sunday.Pathak said the Maoists forced them to sleep in open fields and eat whatever the villagers offered them. ""The students were released unhurt because they followed all the instructions,"" Pathak said.The three students were first spotted by villagers. ""The villagers did not understand Hindi, English or Marathi while the youths did not know didn't know the tribal language. The villagers took them along. The next day, a man in green uniform, questioned them, but the language barrier remained,"" Pathak added.The students were then taken to another village where they were kept for two more days. ""Another man in uniform, who looked like their boss, questioned them with the help of an interpreter. This cleared the confusion and they were finally released,"" Pathak added.Adarsh and Shrikrishna have left for Karad, their native village in Satara district, while Vikas went to his house in Perne Phata near Wagholi.Vikas's sister Madhumati said a team of Chhattisgarh and Gadchiroli police brought the three boys to Pune in a special vehicle.

Panaji: The disciplinary committee of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) is expected to come down hard on FC Goa after the match commissioner urged action “to save Indian football from being taken hostage by a few people”.AK Mamukoya, who was the match commissioner for Sunday’s calamitous Indian Super League ( ISL ) final clash between FC Goa and Chennaiyin FC at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda, has submitted an explosive two-page report to the AIFF that possibly seals all escape routes for the Goan franchise.“The image of Indian football has been jeopardized as a whole due to irresponsible and illogical behaviour of some officials of FC Goa that brought disrepute to the game of football in India,” the match commissioner wrote in his report to the AIFF.FC Goa’s boycott of the prize distribution ceremony, the fracas that ensued after the match between FC Goa president Dattaraj Salgaocar and Chennaiyin FC captain Elano Blumer, besides the ill-treatment of match officials has all been covered in detail.The match commissioner, though, appeared most perturbed that Japanese referee Yudai Yamamoto and his two assistants were abused in filthy language and threatened with physical assault.“It may not be out of place to mention that referees from other countries may not like to travel to India for any of the matches held under AIFF in future, as message of ill treatment would be known to the world,” said Mamukoya.The match commissioner said FC Goa co-owners Shrinivas Dempo and Dattaraj Salgaocar— who he knows for long due to their association with football — “should have calmed down the situation (but) instead became part of the undesirable atmosphere.”The confrontation between Elano and Dattaraj Salgaocar has also found mention.“I have seen one player of Chennaiyin FC, Elano Blumer (Brazil), was surrounded by many players and officials of FC Goa who were pushing him. He somehow came out of the melee and ran to join his team. It was a chaotic scene all around,” said Mamukoya, who makes no mention of the alleged assault and abuse that led to the Brazilian midfielder being arrested by Margao police.The match commissioner noted how referees were tensed after the final, and at around 10.30pm when they were ready to leave the stadium, he was told by a police official that “they cannot give police protection to the referees group.”Later, armed escort was arranged to ferry the match officials to a separate hotel.“The referees reached the other hotel traumatized,” notes Mamukoya.“In my opinion, the behaviour of FC Goa after the final whistle was unreasonable, indisciplined, bullish and frightening to say the least. It was surely unsporting behaviour of the highest order. FC Goa should have accepted the defeat with dignity and shown respect for laws of the game.“In the contrary, the behaviour of Chennaiyin FC was much dignified and respectful to their opponent as seen from their limited and controlled celebration after the win,” said the match commissioner.The AIFF has forwarded the match commissioner’s report to its disciplinary committee for necessary action."

DHAKA/NEW DELHI: Bangladeshi police stormed a restaurant in the capital Dhaka and rescued 13 hostages on Saturday, one official said, after an attack claimed byGunmen attacked the upscale cafe in the diplomatic area of Dhaka late on Friday and had been holding about 20 hostages, including foreigners, before police poured into the building to try to free those stuck inside. At least two police were killed.A police officer at the scene said that when security forces tried to enter the premises at the beginning of the siege they met a hail of bullets and grenades.Television footage showed a number of police being led away from the site with blood on their faces and clothes. Heavily armed officers were seen milling on the street outside.The number of hostages still in the restaurant was unclear, Mizanur Rahman Bhuiyan, a deputy director at the Rapid Action Battalion force, said.Bhuiyan said one foreigner, probably Japanese, was among those who escaped after more than 100 commandos launched an operation to secure the restaurant.Islamic State, which has claimed the attacks, posted photos of what it said were dead foreigners killed in the assault on the cafe, where police believe eight to nine gunmen are holed up and armed with assault rifles and grenades.Gowher Rizvi, an adviser to Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, told Reuters that security forces had tried to negotiate a way out of the crisis.Police said the gunmen attacked the Holey Artisan restaurant in the Gulshan district of Dhaka, popular with expatriates, in an assault that began around 9 p.m local time on Friday. The assailants exchanged sporadic gunfire with police outside for several hours after the attack.Islamic State said 24 people had died. Bangladesh police denied that, saying two police officers had been killed and at least 20 people wounded.Italian and Indian nationals were among the hostages, said a duty officer at Rapid Action Battalion's (RAB) control room.Italy's ambassador to Bangladesh, Mario Palma, told Italian state TV seven Italians were among the hostages. A Japanese government spokesman, quoting Dhaka police, said 12 people had been rescued but it was not known if any Japanese were among them.The hostage crisis marks an escalation from a recent spate of murders claimed by Islamic State and al-Qaida on liberals, gays, foreigners and religious minorities, and could deal a major blow to the country's vital $25 billion garment sector.The restaurant assault also comes after Bangladesh hanged an Islamist party leader, Motiur Rahman Nizami, on May 11 for genocide and other crimes committed during a 1971 war of independence from Pakistan. That has drawn an angry reaction and some scattered violence from supporters. Nizami, 73, was a former legislator and minister during opposition leader Khaleda Zia's last term as prime minister.Last year, several Western retailers temporarily halted visits to Dhaka following the killing of two foreigners.Earlier on Friday,to death at a temple in Jhinaidah district, 300km (188 miles) southwest of Dhaka.Both Islamic State and al Qaeda have claimed responsibility for many of the killings, although local authorities say no operational links exist between Bangladeshi militants and international jihadi networks.Bangladesh security officials say two local militant groups, Ansar-al-Islam and Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen, are behind the violence. Ansar pledges allegiance to al Qaeda, while Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen claims it represents Islamic State.""The bottom line is Bangladesh has plenty of local, often unaffiliated, militants and radicals happy to stage attacks in ISIS 's name,"" said Michael Kugelman, South Asia associate at The Wilson Centre in Washington D.C., using an acronym commonly used for Islamic State.Islamic State had claimed more attacks in Bangladesh than in Pakistan or Afghanistan, he said.Rizvi, the Bangladesh prime minister's adviser, said the hostage crisis began when security guards in the diplomatic enclave noticed several gunmen outside a medical centre.When the guards approached, the gunmen ran into the restaurant, which was packed with people waiting for tables, he added.An employee who escaped told local television about 20 customers were in the restaurant at the time, most of them foreigners. The restaurant has a seating capacity of around 25 people.Some 15 to 20 staff were working at the restaurant at the time, the employee said.

WASHINGTON: In a bizarre case, an American couple called police claiming they have been taken hostage by their pet cat.The pair from Wisconsin decided to call the authorities to deal with the out-of-control cat, who minutes before had attacked the husband.Talking to the operator, the woman said: ""This is gonna sound like a strange question but we have a cat and it's going crazy and it attacked my husband.""""We're kind of hostage in our house and we're just wondering who we should call to do something, get rid of the cat or help us?""In the end, the officers came over, the feisty cat was taken away and husband and wife escaped unharmed, almost.The cat attacked the woman's husband last week. They put it in a room to calm down, but after they let it out, it attacked him again.Police turned the cat over to animal control, WISN Milwaukee reported.""There's been weirder (calls), but this is one of the more unusual ones.

It was in October 2008 when writer-filmmaker Saurabh Varma learnt about the widely-reported police encounter of a 25-year-old Patna man who had held a Mumbaibound bus hostage in Kurla . The incident kicked up a storm after Mumbai police alleged that the youngster intended to assassinate a prominent Mumbai politico, sparking criticism across the country.And while that's where Saurabh, who admits to being shaken by the incident, got the idea for his upcoming investigative thriller, 7 Hours to Go, he is quick to point out that the film is an amalgamation of several other real events, bound by fictional characters. ""My film has no political representation but the hostage crisis is the same. Someone who is new to Mumbai enters the city and holds it at ransom"".While that was a bus, my film is set in a courtroom in the High Court,"" the filmmaker points out, adding that the film could be described as an Ittefaqmeets-Neerja and also draws extensively from a case that can be likened with a mouse trapped inside a cage and making demands to the cats outside"".The case Saurabh is referring to was another widely-reported incident from November 2015 when the employees of a food ordering start-up took the co-founders of the firm, Gaurav Choudhary and Harshvardhan Mandad , hostage for two days after they were handed the pink slip through a mass e-mail. After police and politicians intervened to diffuse the crisis, over 20 employees received two months' salary and references for future jobs.""These pressure tactics don't make sense but symbolise the helplessness of the hostages and the man taking them hostage. It's oxymoronic! At times the mouse is actually the cat and that makes the pacy cat-and-mouse chase so much more fun."" Saurabh signs off with a smile."

VASCO: Striking Western India Shipyard Limited (

) workers locked the

police within the shipyard on Saturday. The police had come there to rescue two workers being held hostage by the strikers since two days.

Mormugao police said two interns of a private auditing company, Dammor Joshi and Manish Bohest had been sent from the WISL head office two days back to carry out auditing work. Senior auditors were to join them later.

The striking workers held Joshi and Bohest hostage at the shipyard for two days. On Saturday, when Mormugao PI Kapil Nayak, PSI Patil, along with some eight constables, entered the shipyard to release the auditors, the workers locked the gate from inside and sat in front of it shouting slogans against the company and the government.

PI Nayak immediately telephoned the leader of the workers Ajit Singh Rane and warned of strict action. Rane arrived by 3pm and urged the workers to release the interns and co-operate with the police. He said the company had done the workers injustice by not paying them salaries in spite of assurances. He also blamed the chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar, local MLA and power minister Milind Naik and the government for not fulfilling their duties.

Both Joshi and Bohest were taken to the police station, but they refused to lodge a complaint against the workers. They maintained that though they were held for two days, they were given food and were not manhandled.

A biomedical engineer, Prabhas Samal, had been kidnapped last month from Sirte along with another Indian by some youth owing allegiance to IS.Samal and the other Indian were employed with a hospital in Sirte. Samal had earlier been reported to have called his sister in Odisa and told her that he had been released after he signed a bond saying that he was going to continue to work with the hospital.Samal was flown back to India Thursday. He is said to have met NSA Ajit Doval after his return.?While MEA was tight-lipped about his release, Samal himself thanked PM Narendra Modi and MEA for his release.“I was deeply traumatized; every moment was a moment between life and death. It is only after coming here that I realized that the Prime Minister, the defence secretary and the whole security set up was so closely involved in saving me,” Samal was quoted as saying.He said he and his colleague never thought something could happen to them as they were health workers. He said his kidnappers were from IS as the Sirte region is dominated by that terror group."

CHENNAI: Tension prevailed at the Central Prison in Puzhal on Friday evening after several inmates brutally attacked five prison officials and detained two of them at the high security block for nearly five hours. After prolonged negotiations by deputy inspector general of police (prisons) A G Maurya and DIG (prisons) in-charge S Rajendran, the attackers, including Al-Umma operatives, released assistant jailer Kumar and warden Ravi, police said.All five officials, including warden Muthumani who is a regular member of teams assigned to search for mobile phones and contraband on the campus, jailer Ilavarasan and warden Mohan, are recovering at the Stanley Medical College and Hospital. They were attacked with iron rods and plates sharpened into weapons, allegedly because they continuously hindered the prisoners’ access to mobile phones and other banned stuff.Prison sources said that at least 19 people, including suspected Al-Umma operatives Bilal Malik, Panna Ismail, S ‘Police’ Fakruddin and Mannadi Abdullah, had been detained in the high security block that is close to block 1.Just before the various blocks were battened down for the evening, some of the prisoners who had access to block 1 sneaked into the place where warden Muthumani was. They dragged him out and beat him up black and blue, officials said. Hearing his cries, Ilavarasan, Kumar, Ravi and Mohan rushed to his side. The inmates set upon the four too and ‘locked up’ Kumar and Ravi in one of the cells. They were released only after talks with senior officials.Based on the complaint from jailer Ilavarasan, the Puzhal police registered a fresh case against the 19 people detained in the high security block.Inquiries revealed that those responsible for Friday’s assault allegedly came to know that several inmates of Coimbatore Central Prison, including some Al-Umma operatives and members of a few fundamentalist groups, were enjoying free access to many banned articles, including mobile phones, because of the ‘blessings’ of a senior official there. Furious that they were being denied the same access due to the adamant attitude of some officials at the Puzhal prison they resorted to violence, a senior prison official said."

BHOPAL: In a brazen display of muscle power, timber mafia allegedly took hostage a forest ranger and two forest guards in Damoh district on Thursday night. The three forest department employees were released when a tractor loaded with logs felled in a reserved forest area was freed forcibly by a group of 100 armed people.More than 24 hours after the incident, the police have not registered an FIR because of usual slugfest over police jurisdiction.Explaining the incident, sub-divisional officer (forest) Vidhyabhushan Singh told TOI, “There were six of us on the spot in a radius of 500 metres. When we confiscated the tractor loaded with logs, more than 100 armed men mobbed us. They must have been hiding in bushes and keeping a watch on us.”“Sensing the danger, I ran for my life for almost a km. I somehow managed to sms my superiors and narrated them the incident,” Singh said. Of six forest department personnel on duty, deputy ranger CN Choubey and two forest guards Prabhat Pateria and Sanjeev Shakya were taken hostage as they were near tractor trolley, he said.In the high-voltage drama lasting 3 hours, the mob did not allow trio to move from the spot. They were released when the tractor was taken away forcibly and reached its destination, he said.The SDO said he and his teammates were sitting at Tendukheda police station till 10.30 pm, but the case was not registered.Damoh police said there was a dispute over jurisdiction of two districts-whether the incident took place in Jabalpur or Damoh.The SDO forest said: “Jabalpur is 1 km away from the place where the incident took place on Thursday.”SP Damoh district Tilak Singh said, “The forest department was not able to explain the location where the incident took place and names of the people involved in it. “I have sent my officers to the spot again to find out facts.”It is not an isolated case when the forest mafia manhandled the forest department employees. In fact, there has been a rise in number of cases of assault on forest department officials since 2014 by sand and forest mafia across the state."

GHAZIABAD: Three unidentified men robbed a house in Ghaziabad late on Monday evening after taking the owner, who is a trader, and his wife hostage at gunpoint. They fled with around Rs 10 lakh in cash, jewellery worth Rs 18 lakh, an SUV and other valuables.The robbery took place in Agrawal’s second-floor apartment in Nehru Nagar-3 of Ghaziabad. The trader, Narendra Agrawal (57) and his wife Malti (57) were alone at home at the time of the incident. His son Abhisek (29), daughter-in-law Akanksha (26) and three-year-old granddaughter were on a return flight to Delhi from France where they had gone on a holiday around one week ago.The robbers allegedly tied up Agrawal and his wife with trouser strings and strips of clothes after they took them at gunpoint. The couple was then dumped in one of the rooms, following which the robbers ransacked the entire house for around three hours.On Monday, Agrawal, who trades in steel, had driven home from his office in Bulandshahr Road in his SUV around 8.30pm. His driver, Ashok, had left early. Abhisek, who reached Ghaziabad on Tuesday morning, told TOI that the men were lying in wait and ambushed his father when he reached home.“Two men were already hiding near the staircase that leads from our main door to the terrace when my father reached home. They pointed a gun at his head as soon as he rang the doorbell and forcibly entered inside when my mother opened the door. Another man, who had probably been waiting downstairs, also entered the house. After tying up the hands and legs of my parents, the men dumped them in one of the rooms. They spent around three hours inside the flat and left after threatening my parents of dire consequences. The men consumed alcohol that was kept in the house and had some snacks during the time they were inside,” Abhisek told TOI.Agrawal lodged a complaint in Sihani Gate police station of Ghaziabad on Tuesday, on the basis of which cops have registered an FIR under Section 394 (robbery) of IPC. According to family members, the robbers decamped with around Rs 10 lakh in cash, gold and silver jewellery worth Rs 18 lakh, a .32 bore licensed revolver, several bottles of liquor and 10 mobile phones, as well as the SUV.Police susects this to be an insider’s job who knew the couple would be home alone."

NEW DELHI: A 28-year-old man who was kidnapped by two men in outer Delhi’s Paschim Vihar on Saturday was rescued on Monday morning. Apparently, the police were able to free Saurabh Gupta, son of an electronics company owner, just hours before his abductors planned to kill him if the family failed to deliver the Rs 5 crore they had demanded by Monday noon.After arresting Manish (23) and his friend, Satnam Singh (44), police revealed that the former had worked at the warehouse of the electronics company in Karol Bagh four years ago. But if he had no mala fide intentions then, a visit to the busy showroom of the company in 2015 to make purchases for his sister’s marriage tempted him. Manish then began going there more often, criminally planning on ways to get his hands on quick cash.This perverse intention finally took concrete shape on Saturday when Manish and Singh decided to abduct Saurabh Gupta, whose father owns the electronics company. M N Tiwari, DCP (Outer), pointed out, “The two men rented a place in Chander Vihar around 20 days ago and took their victim to the house.”The cops disclosed that the pair intercepted Saurabh’s white Honda City car around 500 metres from his store. When a scuffle ensued with Saurabh trying to fend off his assailants, the duo used chloroform to render their victim unconscious and then pushed him on to the rear seat of the car.When Saurabh did not return home till 9.30pm, the family was frantic, especially since the son did not respond to the phone calls they made. Finally a call went through, but the person who received the call was not Saurabh. It was Manish, who told Saurabh’s father that he had taken his son hostage and would call him the following day on Whatsapp to inform him how they could free him. Manish warned the family not to inform the cops.Saurabh’s thoroughly shaken father reached out to the cops anyway. “The family reported the matter first at west Delhi’s Moti Nagar police station, but the case was transferred to the Outer district as the incident had taken place here,” said DCP Tiwari. The police set out to rescue the young man, and several investigative teams were set up under the leadership of inspector Sukbir Malik.Police disclosed that the family got the ransom call for Rs 5 crore around 10 am on Sunday. By this time, the phone calls were being traced, but the first-time kidnappers were smart enough to dodge the cops. “They took Saurabh to areas like Bahadurgarh in Haryana and Ghewra near Baba Haridas Nagar and made the phone calls from these areas to prevent the cops from determining the exact identification of their location,” said a senior police officer.Police, however, managed to get some information about one of the accused and sent out teams to search 300 houses in Chander Vihar where the pair was suspected to be hiding. The residents in the locality were shown the photo of the victim and asked whether they had seen someone new in the area lately.It eventually took almost 20 hours before the cops got a solid clue about the whereabouts of the two accused.Four police teams were placed in strategic positions around the identified house, and the duo was apprehended as they were trying to escape with the victim from a rear door.Manish and Singh admitted that they urgently needed money and had decided to kidnap Saurabh for ransom. The two are both Delhi residents and knew each other for six years. When setting out to implement their nefarious plan, they told their families that they were going to Chandigarh on a business trip. They were armed with a country-made pistol that the cops have now taken into custody."

NEW DELHI: The government is stepping up efforts around cyber security to check the rising menace of financial frauds and terror threats, but has promised that there will be no witch-hunting to ensure that privacy of citizens is maintained despite heightened measures.Ravi Shankar Prasad, Minister for Law and IT, said that cyber security is one of the priority areas for the Modi government at a time when India is on an overdrive in promoting cashless transactions and has been rolling out numerous citizen-empowerment services digitally.However, there would be no compromise when it comes to the privacy of individuals through snooping and other such measures. “Individual privacy is a must, and should remain important,” Prasad told TOI, while also adding that “privacy cannot become a shield for the corrupt or terrorists.”The minister said that in between efforts to strengthen cyber laws, due regard needs to be given to an individual’s right to privacy. “Any surveillance of money launderers or terrorists is done, and should be done, after proper homework, feedback of security agencies and intelligence agencies, and when there is a tangible evidence of wrong-doing.”The government’s focus on cyber-security comes at a time when India is playing host to the Global Conference on Cyber-Space that would be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi later this week.Cyber and IT Ministers from over a dozen countries will be participating at the conference while top industrialists such as Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani , Bharti Enterprises chief Sunil Mittal and Alibaba founder Jack Ma would be speakers (the last one through video-conferencing).Prasad said that the government wants to engage in “cyber diplomacy” as there is a need to strengthen the online security apparatus with a global perspective. “Cyber diplomacy is the new area of strategic interest and cooperation. Cyber security is seen as a common threat by countries across the world.”He said that internet is integral to existence across the world. “Cyber bullies, extremists and terrorists are creating havoc within the system. Let a good international consensus emerge on greater cooperation between countries. We need greater sharing of best practices. Above all, making safety and security of cyber space should be integral to diplomatic cooperation.”The focus for cyber cooperation will be on countries such as the US, France, UK, Germany, Russia, Sweden and Finland. “Cyber security has come to occupy a centrestage in the international diplomatic discourse."""

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday directed the Centre to appoint a nodal officer to coordinate and oversee efforts for the release of Indians who have been held hostage by the Islamic State in Iraq for months.On the lines of its earlier order directing the ministry of external affairs to appoint an officer to co-ordinate efforts for release of Indian citizens abducted by Somalian pirates, a bench comprising Chief Justice T S Thakur and Justices M Y Eqbal and R Banumathi asked the MEA to entrust the task to an official who would monitor the steps taken for release of the Indians kidnapped in the conflict zone.The bench passed the order on a PIL filed by Delhi-based lawyer Gaurav K Bansal, who contended that the Centre has so far not issued any kind of protocol for Indian citizens kidnapped in foreign countries. The court, however, refused to direct the Centre to forthwith intervene and expedite the process of release of Indians held hostage in Iraq, saying it is for the government to decide how to proceed in the case."

GHAZIABAD: The house of a BSP worker was allegedly robbed by armed assailants in Ghaziabad on Wednesday after taking his wife hostage at gunpoint. The men allegedly looted Rs 5 lakh cash and 1.5 kg of gold ornaments from the house of Amit Garg (42), when his wife, Meenu (39), was alone at home.The incident took place in Garg’s Nehru Nagar residence at around 12 noon. Garg, a contractor, had left for Bareilly on some work early in the morning while his two sons were in school. The family has told police that three men forcibly entered the ground-floor house when Meenu was talking on a mobile phone near the main door after seeing off her maid. Garg is known to be a close confidante of former MLA of the BSP Suresh Bansal.“The men took her at gunpoint and placed a knife against her throat. They inserted a pin like thing into her arm that made her feel dizzy. They took her to the kids’ washroom where they tied her up with a rope.

Both his accomplices ransacked the house and escaped with valuables through the rear door that opens into a service lane,” Garg told TOI.Meenu regained consciousness after around half-an-hour and began crying for help.
